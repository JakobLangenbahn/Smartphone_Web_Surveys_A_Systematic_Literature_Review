    "Our first research focus is the completion time of surveys on mobile phones compared to personal computers. In 21 surveys, there was statistically significant evidence that completion time is higher on mobile devices than on personal computers. In eight surveys, this hypothesis could not be verified. The evidence for the longest completion time of the survey on the smartphone is substantial. However, an interesting observation is that we could not verify the hypothesis for all surveys, where we know if they are optimised for mobile survey taking. This observation could indicate a change in completion time if the surveys are better designed for mobile devices."

    "Secondly, we will analyse the Breakoff rate of mobile surveys compared to PC surveys. We can see that 7 of 10 articles could validate the hypothesis that the breakoff rate is significantly higher on a smartphone than on a PC. There were no obvious patterns of the survey setups that could not validate this hypothesis. So that we interpret the evidence to be accurate, this could be caused by more multitasking and other deviations for mobile users. Another theory could be the shorter attention span of a mobile user, which lead to faster frustration and, therefore, faster breakoff. Another important is optimising mobile survey taking again since this can reduce the breakoff rate. "

We found mixed evidence for this hypothesis as five times the hypothesis was not supported and six times the hypothesis was supported. An interesting pattern is observable in the countries of survey operation. We have Germany and Netherland, where the hypothesis was two times validated, and Spain and USA, where the hypothesis was validated and not supported. In South Korea and the UK, it was not supported. This result could indicate a dependence on the users' country and mobile device sophistication. This theory would need more research."

Eight surveys could support the hypothesis that females use smartphones more often to access surveys online and, five could not support the hypothesis. Two surveys supported the hypothesis that more male users used smartphones to access surveys. While the evidence indicated more female than male users, it cannot be proven with statistical significance. We did not identify strong trends regarding countries or target groups. As the last survey was operated in 2017, these results need an update to adapt to current conditions. "
