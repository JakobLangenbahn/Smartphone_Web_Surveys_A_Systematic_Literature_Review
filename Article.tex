    \abstract{Today, online surveys are the dominant source of survey data, with an increasing trend to access them with smartphones. Accordingly, a wide range of research focuses on various aspects of smartphone participation in these surveys. Different reviews focus on a specific domain, but no literature reviews give an overview of the whole research field. This work closes the gap by employing the methodology of systematic literature reviews to objectively identify relevant research articles. For this, we identified and analyzed 86 relevant research articles from peer-reviewed journals or conference proceedings from 2008 to 2021. We observed an increasing publication trend until 2019 and five main research areas. Based on these dimensions, we have separated our detailed overview in survey quality and design. We identified several research gaps while the most critical research gaps in the missing coverage of various populations of different world regions. Most research is based on survey data from Western Europe and North America. This observation induces the need for future research projects that translate existing research to other regions and update their results. Since a graduate student wrote this course work, we identified several weaknesses that need to be minded when interpreting the results.}
