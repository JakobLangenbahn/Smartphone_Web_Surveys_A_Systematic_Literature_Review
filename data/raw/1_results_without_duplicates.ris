AB  - Portable electronic dictionaries (PEDs) are modern digital learning aids that exploit digitalization for the purpose of increasing learners' proficiency in English as well as independent learning. The Mobile Dictionaries Study (MobiDic-Study) is an investigation into the effects of PEDs on the language competence and dictionary skills of low performing learners of English. The study also provides valuable insights into attitudes towards PEDs and the effect of their habitual use on L2 learning motivation. The PED has a moderately positive effect on the learning of a foreign language in such areas as language awareness, lexical errors, learning habits, attitudes towards learning, and vocabulary growth. Findings demonstrate that dictionary skills require explicit training as they do not develop automatically during recurring PED use. The study implements a comparative design since users of PEDs are compared with users of printed dictionaries (PDs). A total of 186 14-year-old students took part in the study. The longitudinal study draws data from various sources. A standardized reading comprehension test was used to assess the effect of PEDs and PDs on reading comprehension. In the pre- and the post-test phases PED users perform slightly better than PD users. During the test a procedure was in place that tracked the number of look-ups. The results suggest that consultations may be more frequent with PEDs, yet consultation is by no means excessive. Another area of interest concerns the development of learners' vocabulary knowledge over the period of the intervention. Two instruments were exclusively designed for the purpose of monitoring learners' lexical growth during the period of PED availability. The Vocabulary Size Test (VST) was adapted into a shorter, bilingual (German-English) version. A second vocabulary test draws test items from the course books that are in use at the participating schools. For PED users a greater vocabulary expansion can be attested than for PD users, which might be explained by an increased rate of exposure due to PED usage, thereby leading to higher retention. In order to assess PED use and the impact of PEDs on learners' text production skills, a qualitative video case study was conducted among 12 students working in pairs. Two learners each were asked to write a text about their school, using a PED whenever they wished to do so. In addition, they were asked to explain particular consultations during the writing process and to give their overall opinion about the effectiveness of PED use. Moreover, one learner, who is experienced in using PEDs, explains the use of the PED to a novice, making it possible to tap learners' dictionary skills in a non-invasive manner. The transcripts of these 90-minute sessions with six pairs of learners were analysed with qualitative content analysis techniques. Results were interpreted against the backdrop of a model of dictionary consultation proposed by Engelberg and Lemnitzer (2009f, 94f.). From all consultations generated by the writing task, 39 out of these 83 look-ups have led to accurate production of English text. Only 8 errors resulted from inappropriate PED use. Although the risk of PED-induced errors is real, analysis of the learner texts reveals that the reservations concerning PEDs as reference tools doing more harm than good, are unfounded (cf. Diehr 2016). Questionnaire data reveal a positive long-term attitude towards PED use and a boost in L2 learning motivation. This is a crucial finding since low-achieving learners in secondary schools are often acutely aware of their own language deficits, harbouring a self-image of "the inadequate language learner" (cf. Helmke et al. 2008, 249). The PED, however, boosted their confidence, especially when the learners found answers to specific lexical problems. In addition to learner data, the teachers' perspective has been included as well. Semi-standardized interviews were conducted with all four teachers using PEDs in their EFL classes. The teachers are positive about the fact that learners have continuous access to PEDs during lessons, noting that learners have grown in their language learning autonomy. Rather than asking the teacher repeatedly for help, learners would resort to their PEDs for quick answers during reading and writing tasks as well as in class discussions. The research points to the need to make the PED itself an object of study with activities focussed on PED use. It has been found that PED users need opportunities to develop dictionary skills in a systematic approach. These PED-specific skills include knowledge about the most important features of a dictionary entry and the relevant abbreviations. The effectiveness of PED use can be increased considerably if the innovative consultation functions (e. g. cross-checking) are brought to the awareness of learners and teachers.

AB  - This study examines whether self-perceived popularity, need for popularity, and peer pressure explain teenagers' use of the mobile phone to make and distribute hurtful pictures and videos of peers and teachers. A large-scale quantitative survey study among 1787 Flemish high school pupils in 2010 revealed that, in the six months prior to the study, 25% of adolescents had made a picture/video of a peer who was being ridiculed, 8% of a peer who was being physically bullied, and 11% had distributed such a picture/video online. Thirteen percent had made a picture/video of a teacher being ridiculed, and 6% had distributed such content online. Self-perceived popularity, need for popularity, and perceived peer pressure positively predicted adolescents' involvement in several of the above practices. The results suggest that greater investments need to be made to counter the social rewards that adolescents receive when engaging in these bullying practices.

AB  - Mobile learning technologies and wireless networks are being increasingly used in educational settings. Mobile learning (M-learning) through wireless technology can deliver information access to anyone any time in any place. A study was conducted to investigate the readiness of Mathematics students in Brunel University to move towards using Mobile Learning in their studies, and also to explore the factors that might affect the implementation of this technology. A total number of 82 students participated in an online questionnaire in May 2011. The questionnaire was designed in order to determine the availability of the appropriate devices, students’ perceptions about M-learning and their expectations of mobile learning services. The findings of the study show that students have a positive perspective of using M-learning and they look at it as a support system for traditional class-based learning.

AB  - Reviews the book e-Trust: Forming relationships in the online world edited by Karen S. Cook, Chris Snijders, Vincent Buskens and Coye Cheshire (2009). Internet use is so widespread, at least in Western societies, that the question of trust in the virtual world and whether it mirrors trust in the real world must be of considerable interest to sociologists. With continuing concerns about crime, privacy and surveillance online and the real possibility that more and more services, commercial or otherwise, will be going online, the subject matter of  e-Trust involves us all. However the style of this book may not be to everyone’s taste. Somewhat functionalist in approach, e-Trust hails from a management science or information systems stable and adopts an objectivist and largely quantitative, rather than interpretivist, approach. It focuses on laboratory experiments and bounded studies, rather than seeking to interview and understand, in their own terms, those who may be affected by the issues addressed in this book. Hence, the user voice speaks to us from some distance and the question of how users from different demographics feel about trust in the virtual world is not addressed. Some important topics are not covered. For instance, social networking, which has assumed considerable importance in a short space of time with many concerns about privacy, risk and trust expressed on a variety of fronts, is barely mentioned. We also gain little idea of where users are undertaking their transactions, and whether that matters, given that Internet access is increasingly done on mobile devices. Also there is the question not so much of whether traders and users trust each other but the potenial for fraud by third parties. The book focuses almost exclusively on commercial transactions and formal ways of how reputation and trust may be measured and represented. Rather than a broad sweep of the on-line trust landscape which we might have expected from the title e-Trust: Forming Relationships in the Online World, we have, instead, a more circumscribed work. Nevertheless, the issue of buying things safely on the Internet and how we are to know whether it is reasonable for buyer and seller to trust each other will affect us more and more and if there are formal mechanisms which can facilitate this and help us to put our trust in an invisible and unknown online retailer, so much the better. Given that the design of computer systems involves turning often quite intangible ideas and requirements into something that must be expressed formally to be programmed into a computer system, then the job has to be done somewhere and, if the book is seen as working at that level then it can be understood to contain some interesting and important research.

AB  - The exponential growth of IoT devices and their need to use IPv6 addresses has the potential to create load stress on the existing DNS infrastructure and it is imperative that DNS servers to be deployed on IPv6 networks. The DNS query latency from a particular Internet vantage point for IPv4 and IPv6 network cannot be compared directly due to variations in the number of hops of query on IPv4 and IPv6 communication networks. Moreover, there is no assurance that DNS server in the hierarchy is hosted on a dual-stack. This work brings out the DNS query resolution latency over the IPv4 and IPv6 protocol stacks with better accuracy. The experiments are carried out by setting up a complete DNS hierarchy (ROOT, TLD, STLD, TTLD and recursive resolver) on dual IP stack (IPv4 and IPv6), enabling both forward and reverse lookup tree on a live testbed, ensuring a constant number of hops between the recursive resolver and each of the DNS servers in the hierarchy. This live testbed is a first of its kind and is made available for Internet researchers. The operational issues encountered during this deployment and service provisioning are discussed and documented in this paper. This paper also gives a clear illustration and provides reference guidelines for the DNS hierarchy setup, and also aims to bridge the knowledge gap required for deploying DNS over IPv6.

A priori, mobile technology in the “digital ecosystem" fits this circumstance. However, if we delocalize to a remote area, this initial assumption changes. Results of a case study analyzing the use and appropriation of mobile phones in the indigenous Amazon Shuar communities show a different reality that could be labeled ‘intermittent ubiquity'. How does the delocalization facilitated by mobile telephones affect a remote area? How do Ecuadorian Shuars appropriate digital mobile technology? How does technological novelty become apparent in a context that is currently ‘off the grid'? These questions drive our interest in examining the three premises of the ubiquitous society slogan in this specific context. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Many transit agencies invest substantial resources in surveying their passengers to generate data used for planning, marketing, and equity analyses. Within the industry, there is considerable interest in replacing traditional paper-based self-complete surveys with new approaches that might lower costs or generate better quality data. However, very limited research has been done to identify the relative performance of different transit passenger survey modes. This paper begins to fill that gap.
The research investigates the relative data quality for three different bus passenger survey methods distributed or administered on the transit vehicle: self-complete paper surveys, interviewer-assisted tablet based surveys, and self-complete online surveys. The research used an experimental design, with the same survey questionnaire distributed via the three survey modes. All factors about the survey and distribution process were kept identical to the extent feasible, so that the only variation would be the survey mode itself.
The findings by survey mode are compared in terms of the overall response and completion rates, the completion rate for individual questions, respondent demographics, and labor costs per complete. The study results suggest that many agencies may still find the old-fashioned, low-tech paper survey to be the best option for bus passenger surveys. The paper mode required less labor per complete, and for many of the metrics discussed it generated data that was as good as or better than the tablet survey. In addition, the findings suggest that online survey invitations distributed on the transit vehicle are not a good option because they were labor intensive and had very low response rates.

AB  - The tremendous growth in interactive music streaming is raising questions about its effects on the music industry. While premium subscriptions offer unconstrained access to music streaming, free services typically offer limited mobility in their usage. If streaming enhances product discovery, and if consumers value mobility, then free streaming could stimulate the use of channels that allow mobile consumption. I exploit the introduction of a listening cap by the platform Deezer to identify the effect of free and mobile-restricted streaming on the music purchasing and piracy behavior of a large set of individuals. Results show that users visited licensed and unlicensed downloading websites around 2% less than they would have had the restriction not been introduced, showing a positive effect of free streaming on these alternative sources of consumption. Results also indicate heterogeneous effects of the restriction, and back of the envelope calculations suggest that the purchasing and piracy activities of lighter streamers are stimulated by free streaming to a larger extent.

AB  - In recent years, mobile computing has shown so much potential that one can see a boundary-blurring expansion between the physical and the digital world. In this context, one of the most sought after research areas is mobile crowdsensing. To realize the vision of crowdsensing, there is a plethora of work in the literature that focuses on the technical capabilities of a mobile device. However, an important and a critical problem that eludes literature is the issue of human participation. We base this argument on a very simple, yet powerful fact that a mobile device is still a person’s private property. Therefore, considering human mentality, can we expect a person to contribute all the time? In this respect, it is not feasible for a human dependent computational system to ignore the inevitable human factor and focus only on the mechanical properties. In this paper, we look into the often ignored human aspects and will study the problem from a psychological perspective. We take inspiration from the mature paradigm of crowdsourcing and discuss the importance of a few human factors that could teach us how to encourage user participation in mobile crowdsensing. Further, we also explore a person’s habitual characteristics that could help answer the decade’s old question: How to get quality responses from the crowd? We use a psycho-technological approach to observe, understand, and find a few details regarding human behavior in online systems. Lastly, we take inspiration from the analysis to present a roadmap that aids in engineering a better and effective crowdsensing platform. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Recently, mass media and researchers have begun to be concerned about excessive dependence on smartphones. Their interest, however, has largely focused on description of the phenomenon (i.e. severity of the addiction, current status of the addiction) or the development of measurement scales to assess the addiction. In this study, we ask a fundamental question about smartphone addiction: what users' common sense of dependence on smartphones is. More specifically, employing a core-periphery analysis of social representations, this article explores how the younger generation has a different understanding of this addiction from the older generation. Findings of the study can provide a rich knowledge about users' perceptions of and attitude toward smartphone addiction.

AB  - In recent years, there has been a growing interest in finding stronger means of securitising identity against the various risks presented by the mobile globalised world. Biometric technology has featured quite prominently on the policy and security agenda of many countries. It is being promoted as the solution du jour for protecting and managing the uniqueness of identity in order to combat identity theft and fraud, crime and terrorism, illegal work and employment, and to efficiently govern various domains and services including asylum, immigration and social welfare. In this paper, I shall interrogate the ways in which biometrics is about the uniqueness of identity and what kind of identity biometrics is concerned with. I argue that in posing such questions at the outset, we can start delimiting the distinctive bioethical stakes of biometrics beyond the all-too-familiar concerns of privacy, data protection and the like. I take cue mostly from Cavarero's Arendt-inspired distinction between the "what" and the "who" elements of a person, and from Ricoeur's distinction between the "idem" and "ipse" versions of identity. By engaging with these philosophical distinctions and concepts, and with particular reference to the example of asylum policy, I seek to examine and emphasise an important ethical issue pertaining to the practice of biometric identification. This issue relates mainly to the paradigmatic shift from the biographical story (which for so long has been the means by which an asylum application is assessed) to bio-digital samples (that are now the basis for managing and controlling the identities of asylum applicants). The purging of identity from its narrative dimension lies at the core of biometric technology's overzealous aspiration to accuracy, precision and objectivity, and raises one of the most pressing bioethical questions vis-A -vis the realm of identification.

AB  - Some studies about processing metaphors, which are accepted to be a natural product of the human cognitive system, focus on the processing where some focus on online processing of metaphors. Online studies where behavioral reactions are measured during silent reading are based on various methods such as self-paced reading, eye-movement and brain imaging techniques. This research will handle processing of prototypical and peripheral concepts and metaphors with varying degrees of familiarity during silent reading. This research aims to test behavioral reactions to prototypical and peripheral concepts and familiar and unfamiliar metaphors during silent reading. In this frame, behavioral reactions during silent reading in Turkish are measured by eye-movement method trying to answer how (a) prototypical concepts are processed, (b) peripheral concepts are processed, (c) metaphors with a high degree of familiarity are processed, (d) metaphors with a low degree of familiarity are processed. To answer these questions two pilot experiments and one main experiment has been carried out with separate subjects. In the research, where the findings of behavioral experiments which are applied as preparation to the main experiment with SMI RED 500 Hz eye-movement device are discussed as well, it is found that peripheral concepts are processed in a longer time compared to prototypical concepts, and metaphors with a low level of familiarity are processed in a longer time compared to metaphors with a high degree of familiarity.

AB  - Web pages typically include many visual elements such as header and footer to support interaction with the user. However, if web pages do not comply with web accessibility guidelines, and these visual elements are not explicitly encoded in the underlying source code, they become inaccessible in alternative presentations, such as audio. This article presents an automatic role detection approach to identify visual elements in web pages and their roles. The system architecture has three major components: automatic identification of visual elements in web pages; automatic generation of heuristic rules from the knowledge base; and application of these rules for automatic annotation of visual elements with their roles. This article first explains the system architecture in detail and then presents both technical and user evaluations of the proposed approach. Our user evaluation shows that the automatic role detection approach has around 70% receptive accuracy, but the proposed knowledge base could be further improved for better results. Our technical evaluation shows that the complexity is an important performance factor in role detection - required resources and execution time increases when the web page has more complex structure.

AB  - Context Online harassment and stalking have been identified with growing accordance as anti-social behaviours, potentially with extreme consequences including indirect or direct physical injury, emotional distress and/or financial loss. Objective As part of our ongoing work to research and establish better understanding of cyberstalking, this study aims to investigate the role of Police, Mobile Operators, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and owners/administrators of online platforms (e.g. websites, chatrooms) in terms of intervention in response to offences. We ask to what different authorities do people report incidents of cyberstalking? Do these authorities provide satisfactory responses or interventions? And how can this be improved? Furthermore, we discuss the role of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) to encourage the implementation of cyberstalking-aware schemes by service providers to support victims. In addition, CSR can be used as a means to measure the effects of externality factor in dictating the relationship between the impact of a given individuals’ privacy loss and strategic decisions on investment to security controls in an organisational context. Method A mixed method design has been used in this study. Data collection took place by means of an online survey made available for three years to record both qualitative and quantitative data. Overall, 305 participants responded from which 274 identified themselves as victims of online harassment. Result Our results suggest that most offences were communicated through private channels such as emails and/or mobile texts/calls. A significant number of victims did not report this to their service provider because they did not know they could. While Police were recognised as the first-point-of-contact in such cases, 41.6% of our sample did not contact the Police due to reasons such as fear of escalation, guilt/sympathy and self-blaming. Experiences from those who have reported offences to service providers demonstrate that no or very little support was offered. Overall, the majority of participants shared the view that third-party intervention is required on their behalf in order to mitigate risks associated with cyberstalking. An independent specialist anti-stalking organisation was a popular choice to act on their behalf followed by the Police and network providers. Conclusion Incidents are taking place on channels owned and controlled by large, cross-border international companies providing mobile services, webmail and social networking. The lack of support offered to victims in many cases of cyberstalking can be identified as Corporate Social Irresponsibility (CSI). We anticipate that awareness should be raised as regarding service providers’ liability and social responsibility towards adopting better strategies. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The importance of information and communication technology (ICT) in economic development has been increasing rapidly along with the Internet and mobile telecommunication networks. ICT development is becoming a main growth factor of many countries. As they realize the importance of the ICT industry, developing nations work to catch up with established economies. Therefore, many nations are formulating an ICT-enhanced policy. This paper introduces a number of telecommunication and broadcasting sub-indices, which include the fixed telephone network, the Internet, and mobile networks, which are aggregated into a composite Telecommunication Index (TI). The indices are computed using principal component analysis and human development type index methods. The country rankings, by different ICT-related indices, help identify the strengths and weaknesses of infrastructure development such that each country can foster economic growth. The performance of TI is compared with several other indices, such as the digital access, human development, and ArCo technology indices. The type of indices affects the country ratings. Results suggest that the parametric index approach may be preferred over those methods in which the subjective weighted summation of normalized variables used (non-parametric indices).

AB  - When using digital goods that extensively collect user information, privacy uncertainty, which is consumers' difficulty in assessing the privacy of the data they entrust to others, is a major concern. We extend the existing literature on uncertainty in online marketplaces by incorporating privacy uncertainty, and we distinguish among three subdimensions of privacy uncertainty-namely collection, use, and protection. We subsequently theorize and empirically test the antecedents and consequences of this new construct in the context of mobile apps. Consistent with economic theory, we argue that because consumers possess less information than the app seller as a result of the presence of hidden characteristics and hidden action, privacy uncertainty is evoked. Using the factorial survey method, we test our theoretical model in the context of buying a mobile app. The results show that privacy uncertainty significantly influences potential users' intention to use an app above and beyond their uncertainty about the seller and the product. Privacy uncertainty also affects the perceived risk associated with using an app and the price consumers are willing to pay for it. In addition, we find that privacy uncertainty is driven by the uncertainty about privacy practices in regard to the collection, use, and protection of data collected at the time of downloading the app-and more important, the data collected while the app is being used. The results of another factorial survey study suggest that privacy uncertainty is distinct from seller and product uncertainties and has unique drivers. The results of a survey of current users of existing mobile apps indicate that the effects of privacy uncertainty extend to the postadoption stage, where it remains a strong influencer of continued use intentions and perceived risk.

AB  - Accessibility revolves around building products, including electronic devices and digital content, so that diverse users can conveniently utilize them, irrespective of their capabilities. In recent years, the concept of touchscreen accessibility has gained a remarkable attention, especially within the considerable reliance on mobile touchscreen devices (MTDs) for information acquisition and dissemination as we witness nowadays. For users who are visually impaired, MTDs unlock different opportunities for independence and functioning. Thus, with the increasing ubiquity of MTDs and their potential extensive utility for all demographics, it becomes paramount to ensure that these devices and the content delivered on them are accessible. And while it might seem straightforward to achieve accessibility on MTDs, attaining this outcome is governed by an interplay between different elements. These involve platform (i.e., operating system) built-in support of accessibility features, content rendering modalities and structures pertaining to user needs and the peculiarities of MTDs as informed in standard accessibility guidelines, user studies uncovering preferences and best practices while interacting with MTDs, national legislations and policies, and the use of third-party devices such as assistive technologies. In this paper, mobile touchscreen accessibility for users who are visually impaired is surveyed with focus on three aspects: (1) the existing built-in accessibility features within popular mobile platforms; (2) the nature of nonvisual interaction and how users who are visually impaired access, navigate, and create content on MTDs; and (3) the studies that tackled different issues pertaining to touchscreen accessibility, such as extraction of user needs and interaction preferences, identification of most critical accessibility problems encountered on MTDs, integrating mobile accessibility in standard accessibility guidelines, and investigation of existing guidelines in terms of sufficiency and appropriateness.

AB  - Mobile food ordering apps (MFOAs) have been widely considered in the restaurant sector as innovative channels to reach customers and provide them with high-quality services. However, there are important questions regarding the impact of implementing MFOAs on customer satisfaction and on customers’ intention to reuse such apps. Several studies have examined the outcomes of using MFOAs from the customer’s perspective. The fundamental purpose of this study is to identify and empirically examine the main factors predicting the e-satisfaction with MFOAs and customers’ intention to reuse such apps in Jordan. This research proposes an integrated model based on the extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) and the features of MFOAs: online review, online rating, and online tracking. The data was collected from a convenience sample of Jordanian customers who have used MFOAs. The main results are based on structural equation modelling and support the role of online review, online rating, online tracking, performance expectancy, hedonic motivation, and price value on e-satisfaction and continued intention to reuse. This study provides a theoretical contribution and presents practical implications relevant to academics and practitioners working in areas related to MFOAs.

AB  - I process satellite-generated data on terrain elevation and presence of water bodies to precisely estimate the amount of developable land in U.S. metropolitan areas. The data show that residential development is effectively curtailed by the presence of steep-sloped terrain. I also find that most areas in which housing supply is regarded as inelastic are severely land-constrained by their geography. Econometrically, supply elasticities can be well characterized as functions of both physical and regulatory constraints, which in turn are endogenous to prices and demographic growth. Geography is a key factor in the contemporaneous urban development of the United States. © 2010 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Such persuasive features can exploit peer pressure as well and lead users to believe they are expected to interact immediately, especially for those who may have less impulse control and seek for relatedness and popularity. We argue that SNS can be built to host countermeasures for such behavior and help people regulate their usage and preoccupation about it better. In this paper, we presented a mixed-method study including a qualitative (i.e., focus groups, diary, interviews, and co-design) and a quantitative phase (i.e., a survey) with 334 participants. Through the qualitative phase, we identified: (1) features of an SNS seen by participants as facilitators for procrastination, e.g., notification, immersive design, and surveillance of presence, and (2) countermeasures, such as reminders, chat timer, and goal setting, can be facilitated via SNS design to combat procrastination, and (3) a pairing between the features and the countermeasures. We then (4) confirmed these results and the pairing through the survey phase. Our study showed that countermeasures could be implemented to be universal across all SNS on one or even more device.

AB  - Within internet of things (IoT) research, there is a growing interest in leveraging the decentralization properties of blockchains, towards developing IoT authentication and authorization mechanisms that do not inherently require centralized third-party intermediaries. This paper presents a framework for sharing IoT data in a decentralized and private-by-design manner in exchange for monetary services. The framework is built on a tiered blockchain architecture, along with InterPlanetary File System for IoT data storage and transfer. The goal is to enable IoT data users to exercise fine-grained control on how much data they share with entities authenticated through blockchains. To highlight how the framework would be used in real-life scenarios, this paper presents two use cases, namely an IoT data marketplace and a decentralized connected vehicle insurance. These examples showcase how the proposed framework can be used for varying smart contract-based applications involving exchanges of IoT data and cryptocurrency. Following the discussion about the use cases, the paper outlines a detailed security analysis performed on the proposed framework, based on multiple attack scenarios. Finally, it presents and discusses extensive evaluations, in terms of various performance metrics obtained from a real-world implementation.

AB  - Despite rapid digital development in the past two decades, the remote parts of Australia still experience disadvantages with the adoption and diffusion of digital technology. As the adoption of information and communication technology continues to increase at a significant rate, investigating the underlying factors of the digital divide in general and also in the context of social exclusion in Australia is pertinent. The current study fills the gap in the existing body of knowledge by exploring the effect of socio-demographic factors and remoteness on the digital divide landscape with a country-specific focus on Australia. Using state-wide longitudinal data covering the 1998-2015 period within the panel data estimation framework, this study finds that digital divide is significantly associated with socio-demographic factors and remoteness in Australia. Moreover, the findings affirm that in addition to telecommunication infrastructure development, policymakers should also underscore socio-demographic factors in shaping digital inclusion strategies.

AB  - Even in the current computer age, there are still many important application areas, such as early architectural design, where traditional tools like sketching on paper continue to be preferred by many professionals over computer-based tools. There is a growing awareness that there are often very good grounds for this preference. Hence, instead of trying to replace such traditional ways of working, it is now often considered more opportune to try and preserve the strengths of these traditional ways of working, while at the same time improving them by providing access to new media. This is one of the main objectives of the augmented reality approach that we adopt here. In this paper, we specifically discuss the realization of a tool for early architectural design on an existing augmented reality system, called the Visual Interaction Platform. We describe the development process, the resulting tool and its performance for elementary tasks such as positioning and overdrawing. We also identify directions for future research and applications. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Lean and agile models of product development organize the flexible capacity to rapidly update individual products in response to customer feedback. Although agile operations have been adopted across numerous industries, neither the benefits nor the factors explaining when firms choose to become agile are validated and understood. We study these questions using data on the development of mobile apps, which occurs through the dynamic release of new versions into the mobile app marketplace, and the apps' customer ratings. We develop a structural model estimating the dependence of product versioning on (a) market feedback in the form of customer ratings against (b) project and work-based considerations, such as development timelines, scale economies, and operational constraints. In contrast to when they actually benefit from operational agility, firms become agile when launching riskier products (in terms of uncertainty in initial customer reception) and less agile when they are able to exploit scale economies from coordinating development over a portfolio of apps. Agile operations increase firm payoffs by margins of 20% to 80%, and interestingly, partial agility is often sufficient to capture the bulk of these returns. Finally, turning to a question of marketplace design, we study how the mobile app marketplace should design the display of ratings to incentivize quality (increasing app categories' average user satisfaction rates by as much as 22%).

AB  - The permeation of cell phone technology continues to alter human behavior by changing the way individuals communicate with both physically distant and co-present others. Despite their numerous communicative affordances, past research suggests potential negative effects when cell phones are over-used. Results from an online survey (N = 498) indicate that cell phone addiction was positively associated with experiences of anxiety. Anxiety, in turn, was negatively associated with willingness to engage in face-to-face communication. These findings suggest cell phones serve to improve communication with distant others while also posing a potential threat to the quality of communication with co-present others.

AB  - This paper examines recent acclaim for professional embedded photojournalists who visually document the experience of US soldiers in Afghanistan using the popular mobile photo application Hipstamatic. These photos have stirred controversy among fellow journalists and cultural critics regarding the use of photo filters in Hipstamatic and similar app Instagram, their contribution to the de-professionalization of photojournalism, and the depiction of war as stylishly vintage. The debates about Hipstamatic and Instagram in war photography open up a whole series of enduring questions about distinctions between photography and illustration, photography and photojournalism, professional and amateur, and reporting and editorializing. In consideration of the shifting nature of digital photography, photojournalism, and specifically war photojournalism, I argue that this discourse about the use of mobile apps overlooks another important ethical issue: the implications of non-soldiers mimicking the imagined hand of the modern smartphone-equipped US soldier, particularly in light of soldiers’ own complex media-making practices.

AB  - We present an online experiment in which we investigate the impact of perceived social acceptability on online hate speech, and measure the causal effect of specific interventions. We compare two types of interventions: counter-speaking (informal verbal sanctions) and censoring (deleting hateful content). The interventions are based on the belief that individuals infer acceptability from the context, using previous actions as a source of normative information. The interventions are based on the two conceptualizations found in the literature: (i) what do others normally do, i.e. descriptive norms; and (ii) what happened to those who violated the norm, i.e. injunctive norms. Participants were significantly less likely to engage in hate speech when prior hate content had been moderately censored. Our results suggest that norm adherence in online conversations might, in fact, be motivated by descriptive norms rather than injunctive norms. With this work we present some of the first experimental evidence investigating the social determinants of hate speech in online communities. The results could advance the understanding of the micro-mechanisms that regulate hate speech. Also, such findings can guide future interventions in online communities that help prevent the spread of hate.

AB  - In the dynamic world of technology, changes and transformations have emerged rapidly in recent years. Service providers such as government departments transformed their services from e-government to m-government for widespread customer reach. However, several issues existed that were obstructing the implementation of such a system by the Ministry of Housing in Oman, especially in rural areas. This study proposes a novel framework based on the fuzzy delphi and TOPSIS models to provide digital literacy and services. This framework considered the variables extracted from previous studies. Furthermore, a survey was conducted on 20 experts to determine the accepted variables. Thirty-five pre-service engineers evaluated the questionnaires using TOPSIS to determine the skills of pre-service engineers based on delphi criteria outcomes. The conceptual framework developed from the accepted results uses 11 different variables based on the TAM model. The study benefits the stakeholders in the area of m-government development.

AB  - Objective: To define the natural history of X-linked myotubular myopathy (MTM). Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study that included an online survey (n = 35) and a prospective, 1-year longitudinal investigation using a phone survey (n = 33). Results: We ascertained data from 50 male patients with MTM and performed longitudinal assessments on 33 affected individuals. Consistent with existing knowledge, we found that MTM is a disorder associated with extensive morbidities, including wheelchair (86.7% nonambulant) and ventilator (75% requiring > 16 hours of support) dependence. However, unlike previous reports and despite the high burden of disease, mortality was lower than anticipated (approximate rate 10%/y). Seventy-six percent of patients with MTM enrolled (mean age 10 years 11 months) were alive at the end of the study. Nearly all deaths in the study were associated with respiratory failure. In addition, the disease course was more stable than expected, with few adverse events reported during the prospective survey. Few non–muscle-related morbidities were identified, although an unexpectedly high incidence of learning disability (43%) was noted. Conversely, MTM was associated with substantial burdens on patient and caregiver daily living, reflected by missed days of school and lost workdays. Conclusions: MTM is one of the most severe neuromuscular disorders, with affected individuals requiring extensive mechanical interventions for survival. However, among study participants, the disease course was more stable than predicted, with more individuals surviving infancy and early childhood. These data reflect the disease burden of MTM but offer hope in terms of future therapeutic intervention. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This article aims to explore whether or not digital space assumes the role of the spatial urban grid when movement of people is restricted under quarantine. The era of Web 2.0 and the increasingly easy access to mobile devices and the internet has created alternative virtual space for urban socio-spatial interactions. The article addresses these concepts in three parts. First, it adapts a theoretical framework that can address the emerging digital public and spatial restrictions. Second, it explores the possible inflation of digital space. Third, it questions the possibility of transfer of spatiality into virtual space. The finding shows significant inflation of digital space after quarantine, but no significant spatial characteristic can be identified among those interactions. The study emphasizes the importance of adapting existing theories for evolving urban challenges.

AB  - During the last decades, an important shift in media use is that people increasingly follow the news by using digital and portable media, while news consumption via traditional, offline media is decreasing. A key question is how this change influences the extent to which people seek out and learn about politics from the news media. Using a large twowave panel survey (N = 2,828) with detailed measures of political learning and consumption of the same news outlets on different media platforms, the study shows that while political interest has a positive impact on news consumption across all platforms, people mainly learn about current political affairs from using traditional, offline platforms. In contrast, there are no general learning effects from using news media on computers and mobile devices. The study thereby demonstrates how the increasing importance of newer, digital media platforms for news consumption challenges the ideal of a broadly informed citizenry. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Users have long been recognized as the weakest link in security. Accordingly, researchers have applied knowledge from the fields of psychology and human-computer interaction to understand the security behaviors of users. However, many cognitive processes and responses are unconscious or obligatory and yet still have a profound effect on users' security behaviors. With this in mind, researchers have begun to apply methods and theories of neuroscience to yield greater insights into the "black box" of user cognition. The goal of this approach-termed neurosecurity-is to better understand and improve users' behaviors. This study illustrates the potential for neurosecurity by investigating how two fundamental biological factors-gender and color perception-affect users' reception of security warnings. This is important to determine because research has shown that users frequently fail to appropriately respond to security warnings. We conducted a laboratory experiment using electroencephalography, a proven method of measuring neurological activity in temporally sensitive tasks. We found that the amplitude of the P300-an event-related potential component indicative of decision-making ability-was higher for all participants when viewing malware warning screenshots relative to legitimate website shots. Additionally, we found that the P300 was greater for women than for men, indicating that women exhibit higher brain activity than men when viewing malware warnings. However, we found that there was no change in the P300 when viewing red warnings compared to grayscale warnings. Together, our results demonstrate the value of applying neurosecurity methods to the domain of cybersecurity and point to several promising avenues for future research.

AB  - Long self-administered questionnaires may suffer from lower response rates, higher drop-outs, and lower quality responses. A shorter questionnaire reduces the burden of respondents. Using this as a starting point, we test the following method: split the long questionnaire into sub-questionnaires; invite everyone to answer the first sub-questionnaire; when respondents complete the first sub-questionnaire, invite them to answer the second sub-questionnaire, and so on. We present evidence that after splitting a long questionnaire into two shorter parts, the response rates of these sub-questionnaires are significantly higher than the response rate of the original, undivided, long questionnaire. However, the cumulative response rate of both parts is lower than the response rate of the long undivided questionnaire. Finally, we show that the respondents of the survey using the original, long questionnaire: i) provide more non-substantive answers ("neither/nor") to the Likert-type scale items and ii) give shorter answers to the open-ended questions of the survey than the respondents of the split survey. On the other hand, there is no significant difference between the long and the split questionnaire on the other indicators of response quality we have tested: item-nonresponse, speeding and straight-lining. This paper presents some first insights on splitting a long questionnaire into shorter parts. For now, the results are not promising to suggest with confidence to split the long questionnaire for the purpose of obtaining high data quality. Further research is needed to find the optimal interval time between the sub-questionnaires or the optimal length of the sub-questionnaires in which the overall response rate is maximized.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Internet use is increasingly a necessity. However, older adults may not use the internet due to either nonhealth reasons (e.g., lack of digital literacy or internet access) or health-related reasons (e.g., visual impairment or movement difficulties). While researchers have studied internet use among older adults, most do not discriminate whether nonuse is due to health-related reasons or otherwise. We therefore examine the key correlates of health-related difficulty in internet use among older adults, and how it may affect the quality of life (QoL) through their perceived social support networks. Research Design and Methods: Data were from a national survey of older Singaporeans (N = 3,966) conducted in 2016-2017. Multinomial logistic regression and mediation analysis were used to identify older adult subgroups more likely to experience health-related difficulty in internet use, and whether such difficulty affected older adults' QoL through their social support networks. Results: Those of male gender, of Malay ethnicity, with less education, and with more instrumental activity of daily living limitations were more likely to experience health-related difficulty in internet use. Social support networks mediated the relationship between health-related difficulty in internet use and QoL. Discussion and Implications: Disparities in internet use are not just shaped by access or skill, but also health. Health-related difficulties in internet use are related to older adults' social support networks and quality of life. As social connections become increasingly based around networked individuals due to technological advancements, more attention should be given to addressing these health-related difficulties.

AB  - Contemporary children live in the digital environment and develop very quickly the natural ability in using technologies. At an international level, scientific research confirms the widespread use of mobile devices in the family and the increasing children exposure to these. This study mainly focuses on the following aspects: the benefits of touch devices for games and creativity and the risks related to possible delays in social and linguistic development and to addictions. In Italy, statistical surveys reveal a contradictory scenario: on the one hand, the digitization of citizens complies with international trends, especially regarding the use of the smartphone; on the other hand, there is a strong technological backwardness in the institutional area. The survey has analyzed the relationship between digitods and touch media, paying attention to usage profiles, usage behaviors, interaction, app selection and fruition processes. It has also been observed the parent-child interaction during the use of touch media, in order to figure out media educational guidelines in kindergarten.

AB  - Recent advances in interactive web technologies, combined with widespread broadband and mobile device adoption, have made online collective action commonplace. Millions of individuals work together to aggregate, annotate, and share digital text, audio, images, and video. Given the prevalence and importance of online collective action systems, researchers have increasingly devoted attention to questions about how individuals interact with and participate them. I investigate these questions with the understanding that an individual's behaviors and attitudes depend in part on what they know and believe about how the online collaborative system operatesathe "nuts and bolts," so to speak. In this dissertation I examine how social operational information ainformation and beliefs about the other people who act in online collective action systemsacan influence individuals' attitudes, assumptions, behaviors, and motivations with respect to those systems. I examine the role of social operational information from two distinct but related perspectives. First, I employed a social psychological laboratory study to examine the influence of a specific type of social operational information: relative competence feedback. Experimental findings demonstrate that individuals who received information that they were of low relative competence compared to others contributed less to a collective good compared to those who received either average or high relative competence feedback. Two key attitudes about abilities and responsibilities in inter-dependent situationsa self-efficacy and social responsibilityamediated the competence-contribution relationship. Furthermore, individual participants' stable preferences about the distribution of rewards for themselves and other people (social value orientation) moderated the observed changes in contribution rates across experimental conditions. Secondly, I conducted a qualitative interview study of Wikipedia's infrequent editors and readers. The study focused on documenting and understanding participants' attitudes, beliefs, and assumptions about Wikipedia's social system and the other individuals who contribute to it. Interviews focused on questions about the nature of Wikipedia and its' user-generated system, the characteristics of the people who write Wikipedia, and the motivations that encourage their participation. Qualitative analysis revealed a variety of tensions around the nature of Wikipedia as an open, user-generated system, as well as between widespread negative stereotypes of contributors as geeks, nerds, and hackers and equally prevalent positive assumptions about their pro-social motivations for contributing to Wikipedia. I argue that these tensions reveal a transition towards a view of online collaborative work as open, creative, and focused on collaboration, dominated by intrinsic motivations such as passion, interest, and a desire to contribute something to the world. This emerging view of work on Wikipedia is captured by Himanen's notion of The Hacker Ethic. Finally, I explore how qualitative and experimental findings can speak to each other, and discuss some methodological challenges and best practices for combining experimental and qualitative methods. I argue that triangulating qualitative and experimental results in the context of this study facilitates: (1) lending detail and nuance to our understanding of complex attitudes such as social responsibility, and (2) improving the ecological validity of experimental findings by vetting assumptions about competence and social roles/responsibilities in a real-world context.

AB  - Design principles for survey questionnaires viewed on desktop and laptop computers are increasingly being seen as inadequate for the design of questionnaires viewed on smartphones. Insights gained from empirical research can help those conducting mobile surveys to improve their questionnaires. This article reports on a systematic literature review of research presented or published between 2007 and 2016 that evaluated the effect of smartphone questionnaire design features on indicators of response quality. The evidence suggests that survey designers should make efforts to ?optimize? their questionnaires to make them easier to complete on smartphones, fit question content to the width of smartphone screens to prevent horizontal scrolling, and choose simpler types of questions (single-choice questions, multiple-choice questions, text-entry boxes) over more complicated types of questions (large grids, drop boxes, slider questions). Based on these results, we identify design heuristics, or general principles, for creating effective smartphone questionnaires. We distinguish between five of them: readability, ease of selection, visibility across the page, simplicity of design elements, and predictability across devices. They provide an initial framework by which to evaluate smartphone questionnaires, though empirical testing and further refinement of the heuristics is necessary.

AB  - This article compares the factors affecting completion times (CTs) to web survey questions when they are answered using two different devices: personal computers (PCs) and smartphones. Several studies have reported longer CTs when respondents use smartphones than PCs. This is a concern to survey researchers because longer CTs may increase respondent burden and the risk of breakoff. However, few studies have analyzed the specific reasons for the time difference. In this analysis, we analyzed timing data from 836 respondents who completed the same web survey twice, once using a smartphone and once using PC, as part of a randomized crossover experiment in the Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences panel. The survey contained a mix of questions (single choice, numeric entry, and text entry) that were displayed on separate pages. We included both page-level and respondent-level factors that may have contributed to the time difference between devices in cross-classified multilevel models. We found that respondents took about 1.4 times longer when using smartphones than PCs. This difference was larger when a page had more than one question or required text entry. The difference was also larger among respondents who had relatively low levels of familiarity and experience using smartphones. Respondent multitasking was associated with slower CTs, regardless of the device used. Practical implications and avenues for future research are discussed.

AB  - Survey participants are increasingly responding to Web surveys on their smartphones as opposed to their personal computers (PCs), and this change brings with it some potential data-quality issues. This study reports on a randomized crossover experiment to compare the effect of two different devices, smartphones and PCs, on response quality in a Web survey conducted in a probability-based panel. Participants (n = 1,390) were invited to complete an online questionnaire on both a smartphone (mobile Web) and PC (PC Web) in sequence. We hypothesized that smartphone use would result in lower-quality responses because people are more likely to use smartphones while multitasking or while around other people and because they could have difficulty recording their answers using a small touchscreen. While we found that respondents who participated in this study were more likely to multitask and more likely to be around other people when using smartphones, these factors had little impact on data quality. Respondents were at least as likely to provide conscientious and thoughtful answers and to disclose sensitive information on smartphones as on PCs. When using smartphones, however, respondents seemed to have trouble accurately moving a small-sized slider handle and a date-picker wheel to the intended values. Overall, we find that people using smartphones can provide high-quality responses, even when their context is more distracting, as long as they are presented with question formats that are easy to use on small touchscreens.

AB  - Although web surveys in which respondents are encouraged to use smartphones have started to emerge, it is still unclear whether they are a promising alternative to traditional web surveys in which most respondents use desktop computers. For sample members to participate in smartphone-based surveys, they need to have access to a smartphone and agree to use it to complete the survey; this raises concerns about coverage and nonresponse, as well as measurement if those who agree to participate have any difficulty using smartphones. In an analysis of data from a smartphone versus desktop (within-subjects) experiment conducted in a probability-based web panel, we compare estimates produced by the smartphone web survey (one condition) and PC web survey (other condition). We estimate mode effects and then examine the extent to which these effects are attributable to coverage, nonresponse, and measurement errors in the smartphone-based survey. While mode effects were generally small, we find that the smartphone web survey produced biased estimates relative to PC web for a subset of survey variables. This was largely due to noncoverage and, to a lesser extent, nonresponse. We find no evidence of measurement effects. Our findings point to the trade-off of the advanced data collection opportunities of smartphones and the potential selection errors that such devices may introduce.

AB  - In the changing news environment, young adult audiences, often dubbed the Internet generation', have increasingly gravitated toward online sources of news and information, raising questions about the nature and amount of news consumed. This study joins many others in looking at the emerging processes of news consumption among, in this case, college students, using focus group interviews to further examine how they go about obtaining news. Drawing upon literature in the areas of news consumption, media habits, generational change and news repertoire, this study identifies an emerging three-stage process of consumption that includes the following: routine surveillance, incidental consumption, and directed consumption, each conditioned by various forms of new media use. It suggests continued research in the interaction of a changing media ecology with generational adoption of news habits and the implications of this interaction for news and news engagement.

AB  - Given the importance of survey measures of online media use for communication research, it is crucial to assess and improve their quality, in particular because the increasingly fragmented and ubiquitous usage of internet complicates the accuracy of self-reported measures. This study contributes to the discussion regarding the accuracy of self-reported internet use by presenting relevant factors potentially affecting biases of self-reports and testing survey design strategies to improve accuracy. Combining automatic tracking data and survey data from the same participants (N = 690) confirmed low levels of accuracy and tendencies of over-reporting. The analysis revealed biases due to a range of factors associated with the intensity of (actual) internet usage, propensity to multitask, day of reference, and the usage of mobile devices. An anchoring technique could not be proved to reduce inaccuracies of reporting behavior. Several recommendations for research practice follow from these findings. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This article reports on the results of an empirical analysis of the effectiveness of a set of collaborative spatial decision support tools developed to support a land use allocation problem in a peat-meadow polder in the Netherlands. The tools feature spatial multicriteria analysis as the means to make spatially explicit trade-offs between stakeholder objectives in three different ways: as colors on multiple printed maps, qualitatively on a single digital map and quantitatively on a single digital map. An interactive mapping device is used as the interface between spatial information and participants. A series of controlled experiments was conducted with 30 participants, who were asked to use the tools and perform specific individual and group allocation tasks. Data on the responses of the participants were collected through questionnaires, observer notes, video film and multicriteria scores. The analysis focused on three aspects of effectiveness: usefulness of the tools; clarity of tool information; and impact on decisions. The findings of this analysis are discussed within the context of the information offered by the tools, individual and collaborative work of participants and the spatial and numerical quality of the resulting land use plans. From the experiments, it is clear that the cognitive effort related to the volume and format of information is a critical issue in spatial decision support. This holds true for both the level of detail per item of information and the amount of information to be supplied to the participants. Although the quantitative tool provided the most information, the participants did not consider this tool the most useful and it did not produce the best results. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The popular #fitspiration trend on Instagram and other social media platforms is intended to inspire healthy living (particularly exercise engagement), though several studies have documented the negative effects of fitspiration-style posts on women's body satisfaction and mood. Pairing fitspiration images with text focused on self-compassion shows promise for buffering this effect and warrants additional attention. In particular, little is known about the benefit of self-compassion (vs. traditional) messaging for exercise motivation or engagement, and few studies have examined gender differences in these effects. The present study used an experimental design to test the differential effects of fitspiration posts paired with traditional messaging, self-compassion messaging, or no text (image-only control). College students (N = 655; 59% women, 64% Caucasian) were randomized to view gender-congruent stimuli on Instagram; they then completed self-report measures of body satisfaction and exercise motivation, and their attendance at campus fitness centers was tracked over the following 7 days (to capture exercise engagement). Neither the expected benefits of self-compassion (vs. traditional) messages for body satisfaction and exercise motivation nor the expected benefit of traditional (vs. self-compassion) messages for exercise engagement were observed. However, results of exploratory analyses suggest that, as predicted, self-compassion messaging may be optimal for promoting positive outcomes among women, whereas images without associated text may be optimal for promoting positive outcomes among men (Cohen's ds = 0.14-0.41). Findings from this study provide insight into potential methods for optimizing the fitspiration trend to promote healthy self-perceptions and exercise engagement during college.

A cross-sectional survey of married individuals (n = 329) was conducted using an online questionnaire. Results indicate that lack of trust is a significant predictor of romantic relationship problems. In addition, structural equation modeling results support the theoretical model indicating that cell phone snooping partially mediates the significant relationship between emotional instability, intention to break up, and conflicts. Findings support the development of trust in romantic partners as an approach to stability and avoidance of problems in romantic relationships.

In 2005, the year sales of iPods skyrocketed, incidents of violent crime in the US increased for the first time in more than a decade. In Britain, officials now believe a surge in robberies in 2005 -- including a 42% increase in crime on London's Underground -- is linked in part to iPods. Crime waves have coincided with the proliferation of expensive Nike sneakers and North Face jackets. Which raises the question of whether the iCrime wave might have been foreseen, or even prevented. Some law enforcement officials think they have identified the next potential target: T-Mobile's Sidekick.

AB  - Nomophobia is considered as the "disorder of modern world" and defined as "fear of being without access to a mobile phone." This study investigated gender differences in the relationship between problematic Internet use and nomophobia. Structural equation modeling (SEM) approach was employed to assess the relationship between nomophobia and four dimensions of the problematic Internet use, including diminished impulse control, loneliness/depression, social comfort, and distraction. The study used the Online Cognition Scale (OCS) and Nomophobia Questionnaire (NMP-Q) to collect data from 490 undergraduate students. Results indicated that loneliness/depression, distraction, and diminished impulse control were significantly related to nomophobia. However, there was not a significant relationship between social comfort and nomophobia. Further, multi group analysis results suggested notable gender differences in the relationship between problematic Internet use and nomophobia. The results for women indicated that loneliness/depression, diminished-impulse control, and distraction have a positive and significant relationship with nomophobia. Whereas only loneliness/depression and distraction were found to be significantly related to nomophobia among men. The results indicated a statistically significant difference in nomophobia and problematic Internet use between women and men subjects, where women subjects scored higher than the men.

AB  - Reading is considered as essential to develop the personality of human being. However, reading habits of human being especially young generation is at decline due to initiation of modern digital technologies like mobile phones, social networking on internet along with other ways of different entertainment. The study was conducted to assess the reading habits of the agricultural students of different universities in Punjab, Pakistan and identify the different ways of reading habit among students and obstacles in reading faced by students. The findings of the questionnaire showed the positive attitude of agricultural students in reading but they face some problems like no access of internet in Departments and computer laboratories especially in University of Sargodha and Bahauddin Zakariya University, Multan. This study also attempts to give recommendations for improving the reading habits of students. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Several authors and software vendors advocate the benefits of auto forwarding in web surveys, but there is little empirical research on this approach. We experimentally tested automatic versus manual forwarding (MF) under different levels of cognitive effort. We manipulated information accessibility (IA; low vs. high) and consistency requirements (CRs; yes vs. no), along with auto forwarding (AF) versus MF in two studies conducted among students in Finland. We find that an AF survey takes less time to complete, but only for those completing a survey on personal computers or tablets; no time advantage is found for smartphone users. We also find that respondents in both AF and MF conditions return more often to items with higher cognitive burden (low IA or a CR). MF respondents change answers more often than AF respondents. AF appears to reduce straightlining slightly. We find no difference in response consistency between two behavioral items between AF and MF, but a slight advantage for AF for two attitude items. Finally, respondents reported more positive experiences with the AF version. Auto forwarding appears to be somewhat more efficient and easy to use but may decrease the quality of responses to cognitively demanding questions.

AB  - Digital interfaces, in the form of websites, mobile apps and other platforms, now mediate user experiences with a variety of economic, cultural and political services and products. To study these digital mediations, researchers have to date followed a range of methodological strategies including the modification of pre-existing qualitative research methods, such as content analysis, discourse analysis and semiotics, among many others, and an experimentation with new methods designed to make visible the operation of data aggregation, analytics and algorithms that are hidden from users. Building upon, while distinct from these strategies, the article sets out a post-phenomenological approach to studying interfaces, websites and apps that explicitly interrogates how they appear as objects. In doing so, the article provides a response to a problem that animates contemporary cultural geography: that new cultural objects are emerging which place in question the habits and practices of analysis that composed the ?new? cultural geography. To do this, the paper develops the concepts of unit, vibration and tone to unpack interfaces as sets of entities that work together to shape the experiences and responses of users. As such, the article provides a methodological vocabulary for the analysis of how interfaces operate to modulate user response and action on a series of habitual and un-reflected upon levels and thereby to create outcomes that suit their owners and operators.

AB  - AbstractEuropean microfinance suffers from a visibility deficit. It is rarely mentioned in the media. Our research question is ?Why does European microfinance suffer from a lack of visibility in the press?? This study looked at news reports and press releases over a 18-month period (2016?2018) to check if European microfinance and its innovations were in the news. The study finds that, indeed, there are a lot of new innovations in finance. But, first, in Europe, the highly talked about fintech innovations are taking place outside of microfinance institutions (MFIs). Second, the innovations that are talked about in microfinance are taking place in developing countries out of Europe. The study followed this up by examining websites of some of the leading European fintech firms to see what they were doing that made them so visible. We share some best practices in the use of digital technologies by highly innovative fintech firms in areas that could be of use to MFIs in diverse sectors such as mobile payments, credit scoring, card readers, ATMs and management information systems. To become visible, European microfinance may need to demonstrate that it is doing new things and that it is using innovative technologies that helps it reduce costs, increase outreach and, thus, have an impact. Forii such as the European Microfinance Network and the European Microfinance Platform need to promote these innovations by offering appropriate awards. Finally, collaborating with training and educational institutes may help add to visibility.

AB  - Do handwriting skills transfer when a child writes in two different scripts, such as the Latin and Cyrillic alphabets? Are our measures of handwriting skills intrinsically bound to one alphabet or will a child who faces handwriting difficulties in one script experience similar difficulties in the other script? To answer these questions, 190 children from grades 1-4 were asked to copy a short text using both the Cyrillic and Latin alphabets on a digital tablet. A recent change of policy in Kazakhstan gave us an opportunity to measure transfer, as the Latin-based Kazakh alphabet has not yet been introduced. Therefore, pupils in grade 1 had a 6-months experience in Cyrillic, and pupils in grades 2, 3, and 4 had 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5 years of experience in Cyrillic, respectively. This unique situation created a quasi-experimental situation that allowed us to measure the influence of the number of years spent practicing Cyrillic on the quality of handwriting in the Latin alphabet. The results showed that some of the differences between the two scripts were constant across all grades. These differences thus reflect the intrinsic differences in the handwriting dynamics between the two alphabets. For instance, several features related to the pen pressure on the tablet are quite different. Other features, however, revealed decreasing differences between the two scripts across grades. While we found that the quality of Cyrillic writing increased from grades 1-4, due to increased practice, we also found that the quality of the Latin writing increased as well, despite the fact that all of the pupils had the same absence of experience in writing in Latin. We can therefore interpret this improvement in Latin script as an indicator of the transfer of fine motor control skills from Cyrillic to Latin. This result is especially surprising given that one could instead hypothesize a negative transfer, i.e., that the finger controls automated for one alphabet would interfere with those required by the other alphabet. One interesting side-effect of these findings is that the algorithms that we developed for the diagnosis of handwriting difficulties among French-speaking children could be relevant for other alphabets, paving the way for the creation of a cross-lingual model for the detection of handwriting difficulties.

AB  - This article assesses the rationale for India?s November 2016 demonetization, in terms of its origins and impact over the following year. I argue that this intervention was conceived and understood as part of a larger international monetary experiment. The article draws upon international media commentary, impact assessments by Indian scholars and the professed goals of the Government of India. Having established a direct link between demonetization and an advancing ?cashless agenda? around the world, I situate Narendra Modi?s Digital India programme as the putative foundation for a transactional economy. Drawing upon ethnographic studies exploring the everyday experience of India?s year of living digitally, this article raises the critical question of who must, or indeed can, bear the transaction costs of this digital utopia. In conclusion, I argue that the rapid expansion of digital money situates these concerns at the heart of social and cultural, as much as economic, analysis.

AB  - Recently mobile phone subscribers reach the peak of 6 million people, it means that more than the whole population of the world. So this is the first manmade technology that penetrated the globe, not only in a short period of time, but also a technology that can fulfill the digital gap in the poor societies as well. As a result there is a tremendous variety of business model to lunch different value added services base on mobile phones. One of these uses of mobile phones is m-government; the governmental services which offer to citizens through mobile phones. Also there is a growing trend for implementing m-government in the both developing and developed countries. In this paper by regarding the literature, we first categorize the requirement of m-government implementation and then we assess these requirements in the 4 information stages by a panel of experts. They believe that after the information stage the role of government are becoming more and more. And the proposed requirements are expected to be fully adopted as the level of stages goes to upper levels. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - The paper investigates the impacts and barriers posed by connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) for pedestrians with visual impairment. This study uses a customized web-based survey of visually impaired people from Canada and abroad. Collected data are used to estimate econometric models to identify the critical factors that affect the level of trust in CAVs and the preference for using CAVs from the visually impaired individuals? perspective. Separate models are estimated for Canadian and non-Canadian samples, as Canadian and non-Canadian participants show some differences in perception and positive attitude towards CAVs. The models reveal that the majority of the respondents prefer to get feedback and alerts from CAVs. Congenitally blind Canadians are less likely to trust CAVs, but non-Canadian congenital blinds tend to trust CAVs. The models also indicate that the respondents who experienced being near an accident with an electric vehicle (EV) are less likely to choose CAVs. Respondents who rely on mobile applications and technology-based devices for navigating purposes tend to trust CAVs. Blind people who rely on conventional navigation tools (e.g., white cane, guide dog, etc.) are less likely to be the users of CAVs. Gender effect is visible, as the female participants tend not to trust CAVs. In relation to policy recommendations, subsidies should be provided to various advocacy groups to offer orientation and mobility (O&M) training services, which are pivotal to educate how to use technology-based navigational services. Also, automobile manufacturers should be enforced to add acoustic vehicle alert systems (AVAS) to both EVs and CAVs.

AB  - Digital revolution is instrumental to the wave of globalisation and transformation of the global economy. But the pace of digital transformation and service trade is low in the West African region. This article investigates the effect of digital transformation on the development of service trade in the region. This research captured digitisation in two standpoints: internet penetration rate and mobile subscription rate. The Im-Pesaran-Shin unit-root test affirms that the model is appropriate for panel autoregressive distributed lag estimation method. Adopting pool mean group estimator, the results attest for the existence of cointegrations in the model. The estimations reveal that the effect of digitisation on service trade is a long-run phenomenon. While the result is robust with export, it is not consistent with import. The long-run positive impact of digitisation on service export ranges from 0.087% to 0.159%, depending on the proxy for digitisation. The overall short-run effect is not statistically significant in export and not robust in import. It is reportedly consistent in some countries but not robust with some others. The region needs to rally in adopting and adapting to the new face of technology to improve service trade.JEL Codes: C23, F14, O33

AB  - A major concern arising from ubiquitous tracking of individuals’ online activity is that algorithms may be trained to predict personal sensitive information, even for users who do not wish to reveal such information. Although previous research has shown that digital trace data can accurately predict sociodemographic characteristics, little is known about the potentials of such data to predict sensitive outcomes. Against this background, we investigate in this article whether we can accurately predict voting behavior, which is considered personal sensitive information in Germany and subject to strict privacy regulations. Using records of web browsing and mobile device usage of about 2,000 online users eligible to vote in the 2017 German federal election combined with survey data from the same individuals, we find that online activities do not predict (self-reported) voting well in this population. These findings add to the debate about users’ limited control over (inaccurate) personal information flows.

AB  - Untersucht wurden unterschiedliche Beendigungsverläufe über 29 Tage nach einem unbegleiteten Raucherentwöhnungsversuch durch eine ökologische Kurzzeitbewertung (EMA). Um diese Trajektorien zu validieren, wurde die Vorhersage der Rauchhäufigkeit bis zu sechs Monate später getestet. Die UKORE über Mobiltelefone wurde verwendet, um Echtzeitdaten über das Rauchen (ja/nein) nach einem unbegleiteten Aufhörversuch über 29 Tage zu sammeln. Die Häufigkeit des Rauchens ein, drei und sechs Monate nach dem Abbruchversuch wurde mit Online-Fragebögen bewertet. Die Wachstumsmodellierung der latenten Klasse wurde verwendet, um die Daten von 230 Selbstzahlern im Alter zwischen 20 und 40 Jahren (Durchschnittsalter 28 Jahre) zu analysieren. Die Ergebnisse zeigen vier verschiedene Abbruchtrajektorien: Abbrecher (43,9%), Spätabsender (11,3%), Rückkehrer (17%) und Dauerraucher (27,8%). Die Beendigungsverläufe sagten die Rauchfrequenz ein, drei und sechs Monate nach dem Beendigungsversuch voraus. Es wird der Schluss gezogen, dass das Ergebnis nach einem Raucherentwöhnungsversuch besser durch vier verschiedene Trajektorien beschrieben wird als durch eine binäre Variable für Abstinenz oder Rückfall.

AB  - This paper examines two disturbing, post-2003 Iraq War representations of Saddam Hussein -- the televised inspection of his disheveled body on his capture (December 2003) and television and internet footage of his execution (December 2006). These representations epitomize two very different examples of government control of information within the emergent tele-technological environment of Web 2.0. The portrayal of Saddam Hussein as a captured beast was controlled by the U.S. military, while sanitized footage of his execution was staged by the Iraqi government and intended to demonstrate that Saddam Hussein died "like all tyrants, frightened and terrified" (in the words of the Iraqi Prime Minister). While both official images intended to draw a line under the continued insurgencies in Iraq by depriving insurgents of their leader-in-hiding and leader-under-trial, the official version of his death was subverted through the distribution of illegally captured mobile phone video footage, which was subsequently retransmitted in mainstream news media. This raises questions about the nature and limits of strategic political communication in the context of Web 2.0 technologies where shocking but popular "sousveillant" content can reframe the ethical boundaries of mainstream news.

AB  - The emergence of new mobile devices such as Smartphones and tablets in children's everyday life has facilitated the rise of Internet private use among them, making it possible for them to go online at anytime and anywhere. As studies show, ownership and private use of a Smartphone shape the quality of children's online experience in a meaningful way (Mascheroni & Cuman, 2014). Accordingly, a broader range of access locations and devices relates to more unsupervised access and thus more independent use of the Internet, which are likely to be related to higher skill levels. This paper aims to investigate, using linear and multilinear regressions, whether owning or having access to Smartphones leads to increasing digital inequalities among children. Results show that demographic variables are significant predictors for the level of Smartphone related skills. However, when variables related with children's Smartphone and Internet use are introduced in the model, the influence of demographic variables is reduced, showing evidence for second-level of digital divide among children. The present study reports on the Net Children Go Mobile dataset. The project collected data in 2013 from random stratified survey samples of around 500 children aged 9-16, who are Internet users, in seven European country, including Romania. For the purpose of this paper, only responses from Romanian children were taken into account (N=522).

AB  - The aim was to better understand structural factors associated with uptake of automated tailored interventions for smoking cessation. In a prospective randomized controlled trial with interventions only offered, not mandated, participants were randomized based on the following: web-based expert system (QuitCoach); text-messaging program (onQ); both as an integrated package; the choice of using either or both; or a control condition informed of a static website (not considered here). Participants were 3530 smokers or recent quitters recruited from two sources; those seeking smoking cessation information, mostly recruited over the phone, and a cold-contacted group recruited from an Internet panel. More participants (60.1%) initially accepted the intervention they had been offered than used it (42.5%). Uptake of each intervention differed substantially by both recruitment source and modality (phone or web). onQ was a little more popular overall, especially in the information seeker sample. Highest overall intervention uptake occurred in the choice condition. A web-based intervention is most attractive if the offer to use is made by web, whereas a phone-based intervention is more likely to be used if the offer is made over the phone. Providing automated interventions on multiple platforms allows for maximal choice and greatest overall use of some form of help. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The wave of the current unprecedented advancements in Information and Communication Technology, which spread in Nigeria, nay Africa is becoming unfathomable has some linguistic implications worthy of philosophical appraisal. The chapter discusses how the new digital milieu is changing human understanding and use of language in social and formal discourse. Contrary to the popular assumptions that the digital communication feat is holistically advantageous, the chapter argues that the advent of digital communication in Nigeria has occasioned unconsciously, more linguistic and social problems on the psyche of Nigerians. Through a careful survey of the style of sending text messages and mails via mobile phones and the Internet, the chapter establishes that Nigerians adopt pragmatic approach, which defies any respect for grammatical and linguistic rules in digital communication. Though, this ideological basis, the chapter argues, might hold some immediate communication effects for the senders and recipients; in spite of these supposed benefits, the chapter argues that the pragmatic approach to digital communication in Nigeria is inadequate. Thus, a case is made in the chapter for a more resonant underlying philosophy of language, which will guide digital communication in contemporary Nigeria.

AB  - This paper explores strategies on how to best balance expanding survey length with the need for concise, relevant and engaging surveys, deployed in a device agnostic format. When designing a survey we, as an industry, are often seeking a balance between competing design challenges: clients have diverse and extensive objectives, survey participants have short attention spans and an ever increasing suite of connected devices to choose from. Survey participants are voting with their feet when surveys are not compatible with the device they want to use, whether that is the smart device in their pocket or laptop they are working on, and this is very real for online panels. We are seeing increased abandon rates, with the effects of extended fieldwork times, smaller pools of sample to draw from and the possibility of introducing bias into our data. Having spent much of 2015 working with clients to design more smart-device friendly surveys, Research Now has explored innovative ways to shorten survey length without compromising on the amount of material covered. Following on from work by Johnson et al. (2014), Research Now conducted a piece of primary research exploring survey modularisation as discussed in the current paper. The approach splits questionnaires into modules, with participants receiving only a specific module, a subset of the overall survey. It is expected that a long questionnaire can be split and when applied appropriately, designed properly and implemented effectively data can yield results comparable with a full non-modular survey. Building on previous industry work on this topic, and primary research conducted by Research Now, we discuss our methodology, the results and conclusions from this work, and explore opportunities to automate the approach. The overall goal of this study and resulting paper is to explore how adapting survey research in this way improves rather than complicates the lives of both researchers and research participants. If we are not able to shorten our surveys, then survey modularisation may prove to be our best hope for a complete, representative dataset and we need to ensure that this is achieved accurately, confidently and efficiently at scale.

AB  - Comments on an article by S. Haar et al. (see record [rid]2015-24912-024[/rid]). Haar et al. addressed a question by examining whole-brain directional selectivity with multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) of fMRI data collected while human subjects performed a visuomotor adaption task. In contrast to traditional univariate analyses that average activity across relatively large brain regions, MVPA offers a refined framework that can reveal information represented by fine patterns of spatial activation. This allows researchers to decode cognitive representations from brain activity and to dissociate between neural mappings that would otherwise show the same overall level of activation. They implemented a slow event-related fMRI design in which participants made out-and-back hand movements to one of four visual targets. All movements were performed on a small MRI-compatible tablet that provided the participants online cursor feedback and recorded precise movement kinematics. Haar et al. have convincingly shown that mIPS, in addition to multiple brain regions along the motor hierarchy, can dissociate between reaches to different directions and that coding in mIPS is not specific to only the visual or motor components of the task.

AB  - Aims: This study comprised part of a larger cross-sectional survey performed in Hungary in the period 2005–2006, which was designed first to reveal the representative age-, gender- and height-specific percentile values for the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in Hungarian children aged 11–16 years. The second aim was to determine the prevalence of overweight and obesity. Methods: Analyses were performed on 14 290 Hungarian children aged 11–16 years. All blood pressure (BP) measurements were made with a validated, automated, digital device. The criteria recommended by international guidelines were used. Results: The prevalence of overweight and obesity among the Hungarian children was found to be 23.4% (3347 adolescents; International Obesity Task Force criteria). Previous studies have reported that the strongest correlation is observed between the BP values and weight, and our results are in accordance with this. Conclusions: Regional differences in morphometry (different prevalences of overweight and obesity) and the genetic background, disparate eating habits and other cultural factors may account for the differences in BP levels during childhood. As the prevalence of overweight and obesity is increasing worldwide, it is important that countries carefully monitor the weight and BP status of their children and adolescents.

The Relationship Dynamics and Social Life (RDSL) study begins with a 60-minute in-person interview about family background and current relationship characteristics. At the conclusion of the interview, respondents are enrolled in an ongoing journal, which consists of a 5-minute survey via web or phone and occurs weekly for 2.5 years. We have enrolled over 1,000 young women in the study and have experienced excellent baseline response rates and high journal participation rates. Below we describe the limitations of past research on unintended pregnancy as a background for our study. Then we provide a detailed description of the study and its design strengths and weaknesses.

AB  - Objective We aimed to replicate the concurrent validity of a comprehensive definition of eating disorder recovery (physical, behavioral, and cognitive indices) in a sample followed up 7-8 years from baseline, and to examine, for the first time with this comprehensive definition, predictive validity. Method Participants were 66 women with a history of an eating disorder and 31 age-matched controls who completed an online survey and phone interview. Results In general, women who were fully recovered were statistically indistinguishable from controls and had significantly less eating disorder attitudes and behaviors than the partially recovered and eating disorder groups. Being fully recovered at baseline was a robust predictor of stability: of those fully recovered at baseline, 80% remained fully recovered at follow-up. One-third of those with an eating disorder and one-half of those in partial recovery at baseline attained full recovery at follow-up. Discussion These findings support the current operationalization of eating disorder recovery, encompassing physical, behavioral, and cognitive indices, as valid and highlight that full recovery is not only possible but predicts full recovery years later. Future research should examine this operationalization in diverse samples and study trajectories of recovery to identify predictors.

AB  - History is inescapable in Egypt. Foreign tourists drawn to the abundant physical remains of Coptic, Pharaonic, Hellenic and Islamic cultures are reminded of the contemporary past as they head downtown from the Cairo airport past the triumphant October War Panorama, a 1973 war museum with fighter jets parked out front. Numerous place names - Sadat City, 26th of July Street, Talaat Harb Square, 6th of October Bridge - are constant evocations of persons and events raised to iconic status by former regimes. In the past year, a new, unsanctioned layer of historical memory has been added to Egypt's villages, towns and cities in the form of graffiti, wall art, banners and flags: artifacts of the popularly named 'January 25th Revolution.' 'Virtual' additions to the historical record, accessible via the Internet, are less visible but increasingly influential. Collected by activists, artists, scholars, journalists and ordinary people, millions of scanned photos, documents, oral histories, tweets, films, videos and audio clips portray and preserve alternative views of the tumultuous past year. Media airwaves and mobile phones convey popular revolutionary songs and video clips into remote villages. Some material is focused on remembering and honoring injured and dead civilians, while counterrevolutionary forces are fighting back with their own content. Digital technologies are now serving as platforms on which different versions of history do battle daily. Egypt is no different from other countries in which historical narratives mirror conflict and its resolution. The Mubarak regime, like those preceding it, effectively manipulated historical memory to serve its own purposes. With Mubarak's removal in February 2011, the fight over historical narratives has become more overt. It is most intense with respect to events taking place in the year since the onset of the January 25th Revolution, but it also involves efforts to rewrite Egyptian history over the past 60 years. This article addresses the following question: How have protagonists in Egypt's transition used historical narratives and memorialization to promote their diverse agendas since the fall of Mubarak? It argues that evidence of the unfinished nature of Egypt's transition is found in state efforts to control access to historical materials and in controversies about interpreting Egypt's contemporary history. It also provides examples of four different processes through which memory is created, manipulated and conveyed by ordinary people: the collection and storage of materials using digital technologies; demonstrations, marches and memorial services; the renaming of civic spaces; and artistic activism.

AB  - Background: Sleep is vital for adolescent functioning. Those with optimal sleep duration have shown improved capacity to learn and decreased rate of motor vehicle accidents. This study explored the influence of numerous protective and risk factors on adolescents' school night sleep (bedtime, sleep latency, total sleep time) simultaneously to assess the importance of each one and compare within three countries. Method: Online survey data were collected from Australia, Canada, and The Netherlands. Overall, 325 (137 male), 193 (28 male), and 150 (55 male) contributed to data from Australia, Canada, and The Netherlands, respectively (age range 12–19 years). Results: Regression analyses showed mixed results, when comparing protective and risk factors for sleep parameters within different countries, with combined behavioural factors contributing to small to large shared portions of variance in each regression (9–50%). One consistent finding between countries was found, with increased pre-sleep cognitive emotional sleep hygiene related to decreased sleep latency (beta = −0.25 to −0.33, p < 0.05). Technology use (mobile phone/Internet stop time) was associated with later bedtime, or less total sleep, with the strength of association varying between device and country. Conclusion: Results indicate that when designing interventions for adolescent sleep, multiple lifestyle factors need to be considered, whereas country of residence may play a lesser role.

AB  - Ubiquitous mobile computing offers innovative approaches in the delivery of information that can facilitate free roaming of the city, informing and guiding the tourist as the city unfolds before them. However making frequent visual reference to mobile devices can be distracting, the user having to interact via a small screen thus disrupting the explorative experience. This research reports on an EU funded project, SpaceBook, that explored the utility of a hands-free, eyes-free virtual tour guide, that could answer questions through a spoken dialogue user interface and notify the user of interesting features in view while guiding the tourist to various destinations. Visibility modelling was carried out in real-time based on a LiDAR sourced digital surface model, fused with a variety of map and crowd sourced datasets (e.g. Ordnance Survey, OpenStreetMap, Flickr, Foursquare) to establish the most interesting landmarks visible from the user's Iodation at any giVen moment. A number of variations of the SpaceBook system were trialled in Edinburgh (Scotland). The research highlighted the pleasure derived from this novel form of interaction and revealed the complexity of prioritising route guidance instruction alongside identification, description and embellishment of landmark information there being a delicate balance between the level of information 'pushed' to the user, and the user's requests for further inforrnation. Among a number of challenges, were issues regarding the fidelity of spatial data and positioning information required for pedestrian based systems - the pedestrian having much greater freedom of movement than vehicles.

AB  - This study examines the response rates for surveys used in organizational research. We analysed 1607 studies published in the years 2000 and 2005 in 17 refereed academic journals, and we identified 490 different studies that utilized surveys. We examined the response rates in these studies, which covered more than 100,000 organizations and 400,000 individual respondents. The average response rate for studies that utilized data collected from individuals was 52.7 percent with a standard deviation of 20.4, while the average response rate for studies that utilized data collected from organizations was 35.7 percent with a standard deviation of 18.8. Key insights from further analysis include relative stability in response rates in the past decade and higher response rates for journals published in the USA. The use of incentives was not found to be related to response rates and, for studies of organizations, the use of reminders was associated with lower response rates. Also, electronic data collection efforts (e.g. email, phone, web) resulted in response rates as high as or higher than traditional mail methodology. We discuss a number of implications and recommendations.

AB  - Online technologies are viewed as a potential equalizer of opportunities for marginalized groups because they may help reduce inequality and oppression through their educational, social and professional capabilities. While many forms of political participation are increasingly mediatized by online technologies, very few studies have examined the extent to which citizens with disabilities use them to engage in democracy. This article addresses this challenge by examining how internet access for people with disabilities compares to others, whether people with disabilities are equally or more likely to use the internet to participate in politics, and the digital skills of users with disabilities. It draws on a phone survey conducted among a representative sample of the Canadian population. We find that Canadians with disabilities are less likely to access online technologies and that disabled users with low digital skills face additional barriers. However, disabled users whose knowledge allows them to make the most of the Internet are as likely – or even more likely – as non-disabled users to participate online in politics.

AB  - Blended therapy is a new approach combining advantages of face-to-face psychotherapy and Internet- and mobile-based interventions. Acceptance is a fundamental precondition for its implementation. The aim of this study was to assess 1) the acceptance of psychotherapists towards blended therapy, 2) the effectiveness of an acceptance facilitating intervention (AFI) on psychotherapists’ acceptance towards blended therapy and 3) to identify potential effect moderators. Psychotherapists (N = 284) were randomly assigned to a control (CG) or an intervention group (IG). The IG received a short video showing an example of blended therapy, the CG an attention placebo video. Both groups received a reliable online questionnaire assessing acceptance, effort expectancy, performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, social influence and internet anxiety. Between group differences were examined using t-tests and Mann-Whitney tests. Exploratory analysis was conducted to identify moderators. Psychotherapists in CG showed mixed baseline acceptance towards blended therapy (low = 40%, moderate = 33%, high = 27%). IG showed significantly higher acceptance compared to CG (d = .27, pone-sided = .029; low = 24%, moderate = 47%, high = 30%). Bootstrapped confidence intervals were overlapping. Performance expectancy (d = .35), effort expectancy (d = .44) and facilitating conditions (d = .28) were significantly increased (p < .05). No effects on social influence and internet anxiety were found (p > .05). Exploratory analysis indicated psychodynamic oriented psychotherapists profiting particularly from the AFI. Blended therapy is a promising approach to improve healthcare. Psychotherapists show mixed acceptance, which might be improvable by AFIs, particularly in subpopulations of initially rather skeptical psychotherapists. Forthcoming studies should extend the present study by shifting focus from attitudes to the impact of different forms of AFIs on uptake. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Trial settings that include proactive recruitment, human contact, and assessment procedures may substantially impact the way users engage with unguided e-mental health programs and the generalizability of reported findings. This study examined the impact of trial setting on user behavior by directly comparing reported user engagement in trial-based research and objective measures of real-world usage of the same unguided mental health programs. The authors conducted a systematic search for papers reporting user engagement with off-the-shelf unguided e-mental health programs. Real-world usage was obtained from a panel that presents aggregated nonpersonal information on user engagement with digital programs across the world. A total of 13 papers yielding 14 comparable usage metrics met all inclusion criteria. In three papers reporting the use of programs by lay users without any proactive trial procedures, the ratios calculated by dividing the usage reported in the paper by the usage documented within the objective dataset were 0.84, 1.05, and 1.27-suggesting a sufficient criterion validity for our examination. In studies that proactively recruited users and included pre-to post-assessment procedures (11 comparisons), the median program usage rate reported was 4.06 times higher (IQR = 4.49) than the real-world usage of the same program. Severity of clinical symptoms, in-person versus remote assessment procedures, study design, and program cost had no impact on these differences. The results suggest that trial settings have a large impact on user engagement with unguided interventions and, therefore, on the generalizability of the findings to the real world.

AB  - Mild traumatic brain injury does not currently have a clear molecular diagnostic panel to either confirm the injury or to guide its treatment. Current biomarkers for traumatic brain injury rely mainly on detecting circulating proteins in blood that are associated with degenerating neurons, which are less common in mild traumatic brain injury, or with broad inflammatory cascades which are produced in multiple tissues and are thus not brain specific. To address this issue, we conducted an observational cohort study designed to measure a protein panel in two compartments—plasma and brain-derived extracellular vesicles—with the following hypotheses: (i) each compartment provides independent diagnostic information and (ii) algorithmically combining these compartments accurately classifies clinical mild traumatic brain injury. We evaluated this hypothesis using plasma samples from mild (Glasgow coma scale scores 13–15) traumatic brain injury patients (n = 47) and healthy and orthopaedic control subjects (n = 46) to evaluate biomarkers in brain-derived extracellular vesicles and plasma. We used our Track Etched Magnetic Nanopore technology to isolate brain-derived extracellular vesicles from plasma based on their expression of GluR2, combined with the ultrasensitive digital enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, Single-Molecule Array. We quantified extracellular vesicle-packaged and plasma levels of biomarkers associated with two categories of traumatic brain injury pathology: neurodegeneration and neuronal/glial damage (ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1, glial fibrillary acid protein, neurofilament light and Tau) and inflammation (interleukin-6, interleukin-10 and tumour necrosis factor alpha). We found that GluR2+ extracellular vesicles have distinct biomarker distributions than those present in the plasma. As a proof of concept, we showed that using a panel of biomarkers comprised of both plasma and GluR2+ extracellular vesicles, injured patients could be accurately classified versus non-injured patients. Graphical Abstract Graphical Abstract Abbreviated summary Beard et al. report that circulating brain-derived extracellular vesicles captured using a novel nanofluidic device contain distinct molecular information from conventional plasma biomarkers of traumatic brain injury. They demonstrate that algorithmically combining biomarkers from both compartments may provide a clinically useful, information-rich method of classifying brain injury.

AB  - Introduction: The purpose of this investigation was to compare the results of a web-based and a telephone interview survey measuring driver concerns about a variety of traffic safety issues, their beliefs, and specific driving behaviors. Method: State-wide, annual random digit-dial telephone surveys and web-based surveys were conducted in Maryland. A total of 1,700 drivers were surveyed by telephone and 6,806 took a web survey. Results: Telephone respondents were more likely to be female and older. Web respondents were more likely to be white and not Latino/Hispanic. After controlling for demographic differences, telephone survey respondents were more likely to be concerned about traffic safety. They were more likely to believe that sobriety checkpoints reduce drunk driving (OR=2.18, 95% CI 1.94, 2.45), they would be ticketed for not wearing a seat belt (OR=1.26, 95% CI 1.12, 1.43), and they would be stopped by the police if they drove after drinking too much (OR=1.17, 95% CI 1.03, 1.32). They were less likely to report a variety of risky behaviors including using a cell phone while driving (OR=.54, 95% CI .48, .61) and driving 10+ mph over the speed limit (OR=.81, 95% CI .72, .91), but were more likely to report having been ticketed for a moving violation in the last month (OR=2.22, 95% CI 1.70, 2.90). Suggestions are offered for overcoming potential sources of sampling bias. Impact on Industry: Web-based surveys produce substantially different results than random-digit-dial telephone surveys, when used for public assessments of traffic safety concerns and behaviors.

AB  - The study presented in this article investigated to what extent bank customers understand the terms and conditions (T&Cs) they have signed up to. If many customers are not able to understand T&Cs and the behaviours they are expected to comply with, they risk not being compensated when their accounts are breached. An expert analysis of 30 bank contracts across 25 countries found that most contract terms were too vague for customers to infer required behaviour. In some cases the rules vary for different products, meaning the advice can be contradictory at worst. While many banks allow customers to write Personal identification numbers (PINs) down (as long as they are disguised and not kept with the card), 20% of banks categorically forbid writing PINs down, and a handful stipulate that the customer have a unique PIN for each account. We tested our findings in a survey with 151 participants in Germany, the USA and UK. They mostly agree: only 35% fully understand the T&Cs, and 28% find important sections are unclear. There are strong regional variations: Germans found their T&Cs particularly hard to understand, and USA bank customers assumed some of their behaviours contravened the T&Cs, but were reassured when they actually read them.

AB  - Objective: As a Web application for speech training, e-learning-based speech therapy (EST) is assumed to have potential for neurological patients who aim at independent speech training in their home environment. This article reports a case study of a patient with dysarthric speech due to Parkinson's disease (PD) who enrolled in a 4-week intensive speech training through EST. The primary goal was to investigate the feasibility and the potential efficacy of EST as a Web application for speech training in dysarthric patients with PD. Materials and Methods: The participant used EST, following a speech training program containing parts of the pitch limiting voice treatment for patients with PD. The feasibility of EST for independent speech training in the home environment was verified through a questionnaire. The questionnaire addressed the participant's individual experiences with EST as well as the extent of satisfaction with technological features of EST, the content of the speech training, and the suitability of the home training environment. The potential efficacy of EST as a device to improve speech intelligibility was investigated using a repeated measures with randomized blocks design. The proportion of correct orthographic transcriptions of semantically unpredictable sentences as well as ratings of perceived intelligibility on a 10-point scale were used as measures for speech intelligibility. Results: Outcomes of the questionnaire resulted in recommendations to enhance EST feasibility. Speech intelligibility, as measured by transcription scores, improved significantly after EST training. This improvement was maintained for 2 weeks after completing the EST training, whereas considerably lower scores were observed after 11 weeks without training. Subjective ratings of intelligibility did not show significant differences across time. Conclusions: The results of this case study confirm the potential of EST for patients with PD.

AB  - Despite the advances that have been made to enhance vehicular safety, motor vehicle accidents remain one of the greatest public safety concerns in the country. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, in 2010 there were 32,885 people killed in an estimated 5,419,000 police-reported motor vehicle traffic crashes (NHTSA, 2010). Some of these accidents could be prevented if people adopt safer driving habits. Texting behind the wheel is especially an issue among teenagers since text messaging has become the preferred method of communications among teenagers. There is some research that suggests drivers can be influenced by the behavior of their parents or friends. But most of this research has been focused on cell phone use when driving. There is limited research in regards to texting behind the wheel. An anonymous online survey was utilized to collect data from 18-24 year olds, regarding their texting and driving behavior and their parents' and friends' behavior. This survey was distributed through the Steven's Driving Facebook page. 441 responses were collected. The results showed that 81.3 % of young drivers reported texting and driving, which agrees with previous literature. Furthermore, no differences were found in the texting and driving behavior of young drivers of different genders and ages. Drivers, between the age of 18 and 24, that currently text and drive are 2.24 times more likely to have observed their parents texting and driving prior to having their license. Also, young drivers that engage in texting while driving are, 3.8 times more likely to have seen their friends also text and drive. Specifically, young drivers in all three age groups, 18-19, 20-21 and 22-24 are 3.02, 4.11 and 4.0 times more likely to have friends that currently text then those that do not. The influence of peers on texting and driving continue to be a problem. More studies need to be performed on the influence parents have on their children's texting and driving behaviors. Public awareness campaigns need to be developed that focus on telling parents not to text and drive especially when in the presence of their children.

AB  - With increasingly digitization, more and more information is collected from individuals and organizations, leading to several privacy concerns. These risks are further heightened in the mobile realm as data collection can occur continuously and ubiquitously. When individuals use their own devices in work settings, these issues become concerns for organization as well. The question then is how to ensure individuals perform proper information protection behaviors on mobile devices. In this research, we develop a model of mobile information protection based on an integration of the Theory of Planned Behavior and the information privacy literature to explore the antecedents of the attitude of individuals towards sharing information on their mobile devices, their intentions to use protective settings, and their actual practices. The model is tested with data from 228 iPhone users. The results indicate that mobile information protection intention leads to actual privacy settings practice, and that attitude towards information sharing and mobile privacy protection self-efficacy affect this intention. Determinants of attitude towards information sharing include mobile privacy concern and trust of the mobile platform. Finally, prior invasion experience is related to privacy concern. These findings provide insights into factors that can be targeted to enhance individuals’ protective actions to limit the amount of digital information they share via their smartphones.

AB  - Self-assessment and audit in anaesthesia require a systematic approach to postoperative data collection. The increasing prevalence of mobile internet technology offers a new data collection method for anaesthetists. In this paper, a system for mobile internet data collection is described and the preliminary experience with its use is presented. The system was developed by the author and combined an open source survey application and a short message service (SMS) gateway to send SMS messages to patients after their anaesthesia and surgery. The messages requested patients to complete an online Quality of Recovery survey questionnaire if they had a smartphone. The results were immediately available. A preliminary survey of consenting patients with available mobile telephone numbers in a private practice was undertaken by the author. A total of 123 procedures were eligible for follow-up and survey requests were sent to 94 patients. Sixty-five surveys were completed. This represents 69% of surveys requested, demonstrating that mobile phone technology can be used to provide significant amounts of data for quality assurance. However, the implementation of a mobile internet data collection system requires consideration of privacy principles, security and ethical handling of data.

AB  - Consenting visitors to a health survey Web site were randomly assigned to a "matrix" presentation or an "expanded" presentation of survey response options. Among 4,208 visitors to the site over 3 months, 1,615 (38 percent) participated by giving consent and completing the survey. During a pre-trial period, when consent was not required, 914 of 1,667 visitors (55 percent) participated (odds ratio 1.9, P < 0.0001). Mean response times were 5.07 minutes for the matrix format and 5.22 minutes for the expanded format (P = 0.16). Neither health status scores nor alpha reliability coefficients were substantially influenced by the survey format, but health status scores varied with age and gender as expected from U.S. population norms. In conclusion, presenting response options in a matrix format may not substantially speed survey completion. This study demonstrates a method for rapidly evaluating interface design alternatives using anonymous Web volunteers who have provided informed consent.

AB  - Questions about how algorithms contribute to (in)security are under discussion across international political sociology. Building upon and adding to these debates, our collective discussion foregrounds questions about algorithmic violence. We argue that it is important to examine how algorithmic systems feed (into) specific forms of violence, and how they justify violent actions or redefine what forms of violence are deemed legitimate. Bringing together different disciplinary and conceptual vantage points, this collective discussion opens a conversation about algorithmic violence focusing both on its specific instances and on the challenges that arise in conceptualizing and studying it. Overall, the discussion converges on three areas of concern-the violence undergirding the creation and feeding of data infrastructures; the translation processes at play in the use of computer/machine vision across diverse security practices; and the institutional governing of algorithmic violence, especially its organization, limitation, and legitimation. Our two-fold aim is to show the potential of a cross-disciplinary conversation and to move toward an interactional research agenda. While our approaches diverge, they also enrich each other. Ultimately, we highlight the critical purchase of studying the role of algorithmic violence in the fabric of the international through a situated analysis of algorithmic systems as part of complex, and often messy, practices.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to perform an in situ assessment of office seating habits that influence chair testing and design. Background: Many chair testing parameters were derived decades ago when the average weight of people within the United States was dramatically lower and the office work tasks less computer based. Method: For the study, 51 participants were randomly selected from Brazos Valley, Texas, businesses to participate in 8-hr assessments of office seating habits. Overall results were compared with current chair testing and design assumptions. Data were collected through written survey and through data logging of seat and back contact pressure and duration with the use of the X-SENSOR™ pressure mapping device and software. Additionally, 1 day per participant of caster roll distance was recorded with the use of a caster mounted digital encoder. Participants were grouped by body mass index (BMI) and weight (BMI <35 and weight <102 kg or BMI >35 and weight >102 kg). Results: It was determined that a significant difference did exist between the groups in mean seat time per shift (p < .001), back cycles per shift (p < .002), seat cycles per shift (p < .01), and caster distance rolled per shift (p < .001). Conclusion: Several key parameters and assumptions of current chair test methods and design specifications may no longer be valid for the upper quartile of weight range of the current U.S. population. Application: The data collected in this study will enable engineers to determine whether revision of design standards for testing office seating for both normal weight and extremely obese workers is indicated.

AB  - Purpose: To assess the equivalence of patient-reported outcome (PRO) survey responses across Web, interactive voice response system (IVRS), and paper modes of administration. Methods: Postoperative colorectal cancer patients with home Web/e-mail and phone were randomly assigned to one of the eight study groups: Groups 1–6 completed the survey via Web, IVRS, and paper, in one of the six possible orders; Groups 7–8 completed the survey twice, either by Web or by IVRS. The 20-item survey, including the MSKCC Bowel Function Instrument (BFI), the LASA Quality of Life (QOL) scale, and the Subjective Significance Questionnaire (SSQ) adapted to bowel function, was completed from home on consecutive days. Mode equivalence was assessed by comparison of mean scores across modes and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and was compared to the test–retest reliability of Web and IVRS. Results: Of 170 patients, 157 completed at least one survey and were included in analysis. Patients had mean age 56 (SD = 11), 53 % were male, 81 % white, 53 % colon, and 47 % rectal cancer; 78 % completed all assigned surveys. Mean scores for BFI total score, BFI subscale scores, LASA QOL, and adapted SSQ varied by mode by less than one-third of a score point. ICCs across mode were: BFI total score (Web–paper = 0.96, Web–IVRS = 0.97, paper–IVRS = 0.97); BFI subscales (range = 0.88–0.98); LASA QOL (Web–paper = 0.98, Web–IVRS = 0.78, paper–IVRS = 0.80); and SSQ (Web–paper = 0.92, Web–IVRS = 0.86, paper–IVRS = 0.79). Conclusions: Mode equivalence was demonstrated for the BFI total score, BFI subscales, LASA QOL, and adapted SSQ, supporting the use of multiple modes of PRO data capture in clinical trials.

AB  - The prevalence of telework and other forms of mobile working enabled by digital technology is increasing markedly. Following a socio-technical systems approach, this study aims to examine the role of organisational social support and specific support for teleworkers in influencing teleworker wellbeing, the mediating role of social isolation, potentially resulting from a person-environment mismatch in these relationships, and possible differences in these relationships between low-intensity and hybrid teleworkers. Teleworkers' (n = 804) perceptions of support and telework outcomes (psychological strain, job satisfaction, and social isolation) were collected using an on-line survey of teleworking employees distributed within 28 New Zealand organisations where knowledge work was undertaken. Organisational social support and teleworker support was associated with increased job satisfaction and reduced psychological strain. Social isolation mediated the relationship between organisational social support and the two outcome variables, and some differences were observed in the structural relationships for hybrid and low-intensity teleworker sub-samples. These findings suggest that providing the necessary organisational and teleworker support is important for enhancing the teleworker-environment fit and thereby ensuring desirable telework outcomes.

AB  - We analyze the information content of a digital footprint - that is, information that users leave online simply by accessing or registering on a Web site - for predicting consumer default. We show that even simple, easily accessible variables from a digital footprint match the information content of credit bureau scores. A digital footprint complements rather than substitutes for credit bureau information and affects access to credit and reduces default rates. We discuss the implications for financial intermediaries' business models, access to credit for the unbanked, and the behavior of consumers, firms, and regulators in the digital sphere.

AB  - The economy is entrenched in the domestic and the domestic enables the economy. We consider this dialectical relationship between the economy and ‘home’ through a case study of coliving, a new type of privately delivered shared housing emerging in response to increasingly precarious economic conditions. We examine how the proliferation of coliving signifies shifting meanings and cultures of home for digital nomads, the latest iteration of the creative class. We draw upon a content analysis of twenty websites of coliving organisations located in New York and San Francisco, United States of America. Our analysis uncovers emergent meanings and cultures of home that are strongly associated with economic conditions. We consider how the spatial manifestations of a precarious economy are supported by new homemaking practices and imaginaries of home – what may be termed home cultures of precarity. Coliving challenges conventional meanings of home: a reprieve from work, private, secure and inhabited long term. Instead, home is a capital accumulation technology for this cohort – a site for the active production of capital. The ideal home for the new creative class is a place of work that is mobile and social. The economy, meanings of home and homemaking practices are co-productive and co-emergent.Alternate abstract:RÉSUMÉL’économie est ancrée dans l’univers domestique, tandis que ce dernier permet l’économie. Nous étudions cette relation dialectique entre l’économie et le « chez-soi » à l’aide d’une étude sur la cohabitation, une nouvelle sorte de logement cohabitationnel privé en train de naître en réponse à la précarité croissante des conditions économiques. Nous examinons la manière dont la prolifération de cohabitations représente un changement dans les définitions et les cultures du domicile pour les nomades digitaux, la dernière incarnation de la classe créative. Nous nous appuyons sur une analyse du contenu de vingt sites internet d’associations de cohabitation à New York et San Francisco, aux États-Unis. Notre analyse révèle des définitions et des cultures du domicile nouvelles et qui sont étroitement liées aux conditions économiques. Nous examinons la manière dont les manifestations spatiales d’une économie précaire sont soutenues par de nouvelles pratiques pour créer et imaginer le domicile, ce que l’on pourrait appeler des cultures du domicile issues de la précarité. La cohabitation remet en question les définitions traditionnelles du domicile : un refuge loin du travail, privé, sûr, où l’on habite longtemps. Pour cette cohorte, le domicile est plutôt une technologie d’accumulation de capital, un endroit pour la production active de capital. Le domicile idéal pour la nouvelle classe créative est un lieu de travail mobile et communautaire. L’économie, les définitions du domicile et des pratiques de création de domicile sont coproductives et coémergentes

AB  - Millions of people retrieve their emails and files using their smartphones, yet smartphone retrieval of such personal information has never been studied or compared to retrievals from PCs. In our within-subjects study, we compared the retrievals of our 57 participants in four conditions: files using PCs, emails using PCs, files using smartphones, and emails using smartphones. Our results indicate that when using smartphones, retrievals were significantly less successful and efficient than when using PCs, casting doubt on the implicit assumption that the use of these devices is equivalent. Our results also indicate that participants used the search facility for emails about seven times more than for files, which can encourage vendors to invest more efforts in improving email search engines and file navigation systems. Finally, we found that the tendency to search shows interpersonal differences but consistency across different situations for the same individual and therefore can be regarded as a personal trait. Future research can attempt to explain the search tendency trait in terms of cognitive abilities and personality traits, incorporating it to well-established theories. This may pave the way to a new trait-related theory in the field of information science.

AB  - We administered an anonymous 1-page survey to 55 consecutive patients attending their first appointment at the Nepean Anxiety Disorders Clinic in Penrith, N.S.W., Australia. The survey asked respondents to rate their preferences for 5 forms of therapy delivery: individual face-to-face therapy, group face-to-face therapy, bibliotherapy (where therapy is exclusively provided by means of books and reading materials that are posted to patients), online therapy without therapist contact and online therapy with weekly therapist phone contact. The results of our survey suggest that patients overwhelmingly preferred individual face-to-face therapy to all other delivery options. Importantly, this does not appear to be a consequence of a lack of basic and affirmative information about the alternative therapy modalities, given that such information was provided by the survey.

AB  - What does children's play look like in the smart toy era? What conceptual frameworks help make sense of the changing practices of children's connected play worlds? Responding to these questions, this article re-frames discussions about children's smart toy play within wider theoretical debates about the affordances of new digital materialities. To understand recent transformations of children's play practices, we propose it is necessary to think of toys as increasingly media-like in their affordances and as connected to wider digital material ecosystems. To demonstrate the potential of this conceptual approach, we explore illustrative examples of two popular smart care toys'. Our analysis identifies three examples of affordances that smart care toys share with other forms of mobile and robotic media: liveliness, affective stickiness and portability. We argue that locating discussions of smart toys within wider conceptual debates about digital materialities can provide new insights into the changing landscape of children's play.

AB  - Mobility is changing the ways people routinely behave in public places. Since the appearance of digital mobile phone networks, mobile phones have become part of suburban and urban landscapes globally. Both the use of public transport and mobile telecommunications are integral for daily life and self-presentation in most large cities such as London and Tokyo. Public places and spaces are being transformed into hybrid geographies through the introduction of new spatial infrastructure. In this paper, we present our analysis of the responses of our survey sample of commuters concerning their use of mobile phones on trains. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Whereas substance-use researchers have long combined self-report with objective measures of behavior and physiology inside the laboratory, developments in mobile/wearable electronic technology are increasingly allowing for the collection of both subjective and objective information in participants' daily lives. For self-report, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), as implemented on contemporary smartphones or personal digital assistants, can provide researchers with near-real-time information on participants' behavior and mood in their natural environments. Data from portable/wearable electronic sensors measuring participants' internal and external environments can be combined with EMA (e.g., by timestamps recorded on questionnaires) to provide objective information useful in determining the momentary context of behavior and mood and/or validating participants' self-reports. Here, we review three objective ambulatory monitoring techniques that have been combined with EMA, with a focus on detecting drug use and/or measuring the behavioral or physiological correlates of mental events (i.e., emotions, cognitions): (1) collection and processing of biological samples in the field to measure drug use or participants' physiological activity (e.g., hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity); (2) global positioning system (GPS) location information to link environmental characteristics (disorder/disadvantage, retail drug outlets) to drug use and affect; (3) ambulatory electronic physiological monitoring (e.g., electrocardiography) to detect drug use and mental events, as advances in machine learning algorithms make it possible to distinguish target changes from confounds (e.g., physical activity). Finally, we consider several other mobile/wearable technologies that hold promise to be combined with EMA, as well as potential challenges faced by researchers working with multiple mobile/wearable technologies simultaneously in the field.

AB  - The increasing use of smartphones around the world provides new opportunities for network data collection using smartphone surveys. We investigated experimentally whether the use of smartphones and of a recall aid affects the number of reported names in a network name generator question. In a German online access panel (N = 3891), respondents were randomly assigned to answer the survey on their PC or on their smartphone and were randomly assigned to receive an open-ended recall aid question before the name generator question or after. Results showed that respondents on PCs and smartphones reported the same number of network contacts. This suggests that smartphone surveys have no negative effect on the network sizes in ego-centered network studies. However, requiring people to answer on smartphones resulted in a selection bias due to non-compliance, which may have led to an overrepresentation of persons with larger network sizes. The recall aid question did not lead to more reported names, but it proved to be an indicator of respondents’ motivation and response quality. In sum, the study suggests that smartphones can effectively be used for network research in tech-savvy populations or when respondents can choose to complete the survey on another device.

AB  - AbstractThe advent of Web 2.0-based Internet technologies coupled with mobile digital telecommunication devices have altered the landscape of interaction between a firm and its stakeholders. Increasingly firms are interacting with their stakeholders through electronic means such as group e-mails, batch Short Messaging Services (SMSs), short text posts, social networking sites, and others. This is ushering a rich era in firm?stakeholder communication occurring on real-time basis (24?7) and from anywhere. Technology-based interactions are viewed as lacking the humanistic perspective. This is especially true for such stakeholders who are differently abled, illiterate, elderly, and others who are not able to adapt to the new realities in technology-based firm?stakeholder communication. In this research, the author explored the effect of inclusion of humanistic orientation in technology-based interaction between a firm and its stakeholders. One hundred and fifty two CSR managers? responses were considered for scale development to measure the variables, firm management engagement (FME), firm technology medium deployed (FTMD), stakeholder interaction (SI), humanistic orientation in interaction (HOI), and interactional stakeholder satisfaction (ISS) with the help of a structured questionnaire survey instrument. Furthermore, a model on ISS was developed. In the model, FME and FTMD were the antecedent variables; SI was the mediating variable; and HOI was the moderating variable with ISS as the dependent variable.

AB  - We believe that, to manage Web data effectively, there is a need to build a data warehouse of Web data, i.e. a Web warehouse. In this paper, we focus on how to represent and store relevant hyperlinked Web documents effectively in a Web warehouse called WHOWEDA (WareHouse Of WEb DAta) for further querying and manipulation. We present a simple and general model for representing metadata, structure and content of Web documents and hyperlinks in WHOWEDA. We discuss node and link objects which are used to represent Web documents and hyperlinks respectively in WHOWEDA. These objects are first class objects in our data model called WHOM (WareHouse Object Model) which is designed to represent and manipulate Web data in the warehouse. An important feature of our model is that it represents metadata, content and structure as trees called node and link metadata trees, and node and link data trees.

AB  - A large fuselage panel is always connected to a full-scale shape-preserving bracket to enhance its stiffness in digital assembly processes and reduce assembly deformation induced by factors such as gravity. However, the full-scale shape-preserving bracket?s characteristics, such as large size and weight, usually result in a complex installation process and high maintenance costs. A method for optimizing a multi load-transmitting device based discrete support layout is presented in this paper. By constructing finite element model including the fuselage panel and LTDs, the panel?s strain energy under different support layout parameters is obtained according to the principle of mixed uniform design. Using the method of partial least squares regression, the mathematical relationship between the strain energy and the support layout parameters is established, which is then used to obtain the optimum multi LTD based support layout. Furthermore, by comparing the panel deformation under the optimum multi LTD based support with that under the full-scale shape-preserving bracket-based support, we conclude that the optimum multi LTD based support can not only suppress panel deformation effectively, but also keep the panel?s stiffness comparable to that under the full-scale shape-preserving bracket-based support.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to explore the roles of psychological attributes (such as shyness and loneliness) and smartphone usage patterns in predicting smartphone addiction symptoms and social capital. Data were gathered from a sample of 414 university students using online survey in Mainland China. Results from exploratory factor analysis identified five smartphone addiction symptoms: disregard of harmful consequences, preoccupation, inability to control craving, productivity loss, and feeling anxious and lost, which formed the Smartphone Addiction Scale. Results show that the higher one scored in loneliness and shyness, the higher the likelihood one would be addicted to smartphone. Furthermore, this study shows the most powerful predictor inversely affecting both bonding and bridging social capital was loneliness. Moreover, this study presents clear evidence that the use of smartphones for different purposes (especially for information seeking, sociability, and utility) and the exhibition of different addiction symptoms (such as preoccupation and feeling anxious and lost) significantly impacted social capital building. The significant links between smartphone addiction and smartphone usage, loneliness, and shyness have clear implications for treatment and intervention for parents, educators, and policy makers. Suggestions for future research are discussed.

AB  - Studying the adoption and acceptance of Mobile Data Services (MDS) has been an intriguing endeavour for quite some time. Much of the related literature is inspired by the technology acceptance model and its heirs. The study presented in this paper adopts an alternative perspective and proposes the study of MDS actual usage patterns under the lens of the Triandis theory of explaining human behaviour. To this end, we adjust the concepts included in the original Triandis model to the MDS context and construct a model predicting MDS use. The model is empirically validated through a survey (N = 365) and tested for its predictive capacity against four different MDS categories (m-commerce, communication, information and entertainment services). Results suggest that the uptake of each of the four service categories is contingent upon a limited set of factors. In addition, financial barriers emerge as a universal inhibitor over and above specific service groupings.

AB  - Background:Upper limb, in particular forequarter amputations, require highly customised devices that are often expensive and underutilised.Objectives:The objective of this study was to design and develop a comfortable 3D-printed cosmetic forequarter prosthetic device, which was lightweight, cool to wear, had an elbow that could lock, matched the appearance of the contralateral arm and was completely free of metal for a specific user?s needs.Study Design:Device design.Technique:An iterative user-centred design approach was used for digitising, designing and developing a functional 3D-printed prosthetic arm for an acquired forequarter amputation, while optimising the fit and function after each prototype.Results:The cost of the final arm was 20% less expensive than a traditionally-made forequarter prostheses in Singapore. The Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with Assistive Technology (QUEST) 2.0 survey was administered, with results indicating that the 3D-printed arm was preferred due to its overall effectiveness, accurate size, ease of use and suspension. However, durability had a lower score, and the weight of the arm was 100?g heavier than the user?s current prosthesis. The technique described resulted in a precise fitting and shaped forequarter prosthesis for the user. Using the user?s feedback in the iterations of the design resulted in improved QUEST survey results indicating the device was effective, easy to use, perceived as lighter and more secure than the user?s traditionally-made device.Conclusion:A fully customised cosmetic forequarter prosthesis was designed and developed using digital scanning, computer-aided design modelling and 3D printing for a specific user. These technologies enable new avenues for highly complex prosthetic design innovations.

AB  - Maternal and infant health (MIH) mobile applications (apps) are increasingly popular and frequently used for health education and decision making. Interventions grounded in theory-based behavior change techniques (BCTs) are shown to be effective in promoting healthy behavior changes. MIH apps have the potential to be useful tools, yet the extent to which they incorporate BCTs is still unknown. The objective of this study was to assess the presence of BCTs in popular MIH apps available in the Apple App and Google Play stores. Twenty-nine popular MIH apps were coded for the presence of 16 BCTs using the mHealth app taxonomy. Popular MIH apps whose purpose was to provide health education or decision-making support to pregnant women or parents/caregivers of infants were included in the final sample. On an average, the reviewed apps included seven BCTs (range 2-16). Techniques such as personalization, review of general or specific goals, macro tailoring, self-monitoring of goals, and health behavior linkages were most frequently present. No differences in the presence of BCTs between paid and free apps were observed. Popular MIH apps typically included only a minority of BCTs found to be useful for health promotion. However, apps developed by healthcare developers incorporated a higher number of BCTs within the app content. Therefore, app developers and policymakers may consider strategies to increase health expert involvement in app design and content delivery.

AB  - The European Court of Justice (ECJ) rules on international jurisdiction for violations of personality rights on the Internet. In recent decades, the Internet has changed the balance of powers in defamation cases fundamentally. Whereas during the 20th century, only professional publishers, such as the press, TV and radio stations, had the means lo widely spread information to a large audience, so that the victim of defamatory publications was usually confronted with a far more powerful opponent, nowadays, everyone can profit from various digital dissemination channels. The worldwide accessibility of online content, an ordinary person may reach an international audience just by using a smart phone and, thus, also cause considerable harm in many countries. Furthermore, not only natural persons, but also companies may become victims, like in the present case. This development challenges the existing rules on international jurisdiction and poses new questions.

AB  - This article discusses the relationship between theories of photography and mobile phone footage. In doing so, it asks if theories of photography still apply in a technologically saturated world of imagery. Technology is an increasingly important part of viewing imagery today and enables imagery to become part of a global cultural flow, thus calling into question the physical connection between viewer and image. This article analyses what happens to that connection when not only the image but also the physical body is mediated and challenged in post-human relations, and examines the ensuing ethical implications. The author takes photojournalism and, in particular, mobile phone footage as a starting point for an exploration of the (post-human) body as evidence and sign of authenticity in the modern age of digital communications and journalism.

AB  - Background: Phubbing is an increasingly common behavior that involves using a smartphone in a social setting of two or more people and interacting with the phone rather than with the other people. Research to date on phubbing has measured it using different scales or single questions, and therefore standard measures with appropriate psychometric properties are needed to improve its assessment. The aim of our study was to develop a Spanish version of the Phubbing Scale and to examine its psychometric properties: factor structure, reliability, and concurrent validity. Method: Participants were 759 Spanish adults between 18 and 68 years of age. They completed an online survey. Results: The results support a structure that is consistent with the original validation study, with two factors: Communication Disturbance and Phone Obsession. Internal consistency was found to be adequate. Evidence of concurrent validity was provided via a hierarchical regression model that showed positive associations with measures of internet addiction, Facebook intrusion, and fear of missing out. Conclusions: These results indicate that the Spanish version of the Phubbing Scale exhibits appropriate psychometric properties.

AB  - Purpose:To discover oculofacial plastic surgeon practice patterns for cautery selection in the setting of implantable electronic devices and present guidelines based on a review of current literature.Methods:A 10-Question web-based survey was sent to the email list serve of the American Society of Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery to determine surgeon cautery preference in the setting of various implantable electronic devices and comfort level with the guidelines for cautery selection in their practice or institution. The relationship between survey questions was assessed for statistical significance using Pearson?s Chi-square tests.Results:Two hundred ninety-three (41% response rate) surveys were completed and included for analysis. Greater than half of respondents either had no policy (36%) or were unaware of a policy (19%) in their practice or institution regarding cautery selection in patients with a cardiac implantable electronic device. Bipolar cautery was favored for use in patients with a cardiac implantable electronic device (79%?80%) and this number dropped in patients with implantable neurostimulators (30%). Overall, one-third of respondents did not feel comfortable with their practice/institution policy.Conclusion:Choices and comfort level among oculofacial plastic surgeons for cautery selection in patients with implantable electronic devices vary considerably, and some choices may increase the risk for interference-related complications. Practice patterns vary significantly in the setting of a neurostimulator or cochlear implant, where interference can cause thermal injury to the brain and implant damage, respectively. Guidelines are proposed for cautery selection in patients with implantable electronic devices undergoing oculofacial plastic surgery.

AB  - The rise of Big Data in the social realm poses significant questions at the intersection of science, technology, and society, including in terms of how new large-scale social databases are currently changing the methods, epistemologies, and politics of social science. In this commentary, we address such epochal (?large-scale?) questions by way of a (situated) experiment: at the Danish Technical University in Copenhagen, an interdisciplinary group of computer scientists, physicists, economists, sociologists, and anthropologists (including the authors) is setting up a large-scale data infrastructure, meant to continually record the digital traces of social relations among an entire freshman class of students (N?>?1000). At the same time, fieldwork is carried out on friendship (and other) relations amongst the same group of students. On this basis, the question we pose is the following: what kind of knowledge is obtained on this social micro-cosmos via the Big (computational, quantitative) and Small (embodied, qualitative) Data, respectively? How do the two relate? Invoking Bohr?s principle of complementarity as analogy, we hypothesize that social relations, as objects of knowledge, depend crucially on the type of measurement device deployed. At the same time, however, we also expect new interferences and polyphonies to arise at the intersection of Big and Small Data, provided that these are, so to speak, mixed with care. These questions, we stress, are important not only for the future of social science methods but also for the type of societal (self-)knowledge that may be expected from new large-scale social databases.

AB  - The article addresses the role of network and mobile technologies in enhancing blended solutions with a view to (a) enriching the teaching/learning processes, (b) exploiting the opportunities it offers for their observability, and hence for their monitoring and formative/summative assessment. It will also discuss how such potential can only be captured by solidly integrating the process of instructional design with that of monitoring and assessment. First, the article presents the proposed conception of blended solutions, giving examples. In the second part, the article discusses a possible breakdown of blended solutions into its various components and how these can enrich both the teaching/learning and the assessment processes. Finally, it addresses the question of how to combine and/or use singly the various components of blended solutions. To conclude, implications for the implementation of blended solutions are discussed, also in relation to emerging contexts such as Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs).

AB  - The identification of factors that affect people's continuous use of e-books on their mobile devices is critical for e-book publishers, e-reader manufacturers and academic researchers. This study proposes a research model that extends the expectation-confirmation model by incorporating perceived enjoyment and facilitating conditions to get a deeper understanding of continuance intention to use e-books in the mobile environment. The structural equation model (SEM) was used to analyse data which were collected from 1,663 e-book readers by an online survey. The results indicate that satisfaction, perceived enjoyment, perceived usefulness and facilitating conditions influence continuance intention significantly. Furthermore, users' confirmation of expectations has a positive effect on perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment and satisfaction. Surprisingly, perceived usefulness does not have a significant effect on satisfaction. Based on these findings, the theoretical and practical implications, limitations, and recommendations for future research are also discussed.

AB  - Antitrust agencies in the United States and the European Union began investigating Google's search practices in 2010. Google's critics have consisted mainly of its competitors, particularly Microsoft, Yelp, TripAdvisor, and other search engines. They have alleged that Google is making it more difficult for them to compete by including specialized search results in general search pages and limiting access to search inputs, including "scale," Google content, and the Android platform. Those claims contradict real-world experiences in search. They demonstrate competitors' efforts to compete not by investing in efficiency, quality, or innovation, but by using antitrust law to punish the successful competitor. The Chicago School of law and economics teaches-and the Supreme Court has long affirmed-that antitrust law exists to protect consumers, not competitors. Penalizing Google's practices as anticompetitive would violate that principle, reduce dynamic competition in search, and harm the consumers that the antitrust laws are intended to protect. © The Author (2012).

AB  - Little is known about the reliability and validity in web surveys, although this is crucial information to evaluate how accurate the results might be and/or to correct for measurement errors. In particular, there are few studies based on probability-based samples for web surveys, looking at web-specific response scales and considering the impact of having smartphone respondents. In this article, we start filling these gaps by estimating the measurement quality of sliders compared to radio button scales controlling for the device respondents used. We conducted therefore two multitrait?multimethod (MTMM) experiments in the Norwegian Citizen Panel (NCP), a probability-based online panel. Overall, we find that if smartphone respondents represent a nonnegligible part of the whole sample, offering the response options in form of a slider or a radio button scale leads to a quite similar measurement quality. This means that sliders could be used more often without harming the data quality. Besides, if there are no smartphone respondents, we find that sliders can also be used, but that the marker should be placed initially in the middle rather than on the left side. However, in practice, there is no need to shift from radio buttons to sliders since the quality is not highly improved by providing sliders.

AB  - Most mobile devices nowadays have a camera. Besides, posting and sharing images have been found as one of the most frequent and engaging Internet activities. However, to our knowledge, no research has explored the feasibility of asking respondents of online surveys to upload images to answer survey questions. The main goal of this article is to investigate the viability of asking respondents of an online opt-in panel to upload during a mobile web survey: First, a photo taken in the moment, and second, an image already saved on their smartphone. In addition, we want to test to what extent the Google Vision application programming interface (API), which can label images into categories, produces similar tags than a human coder. Overall, results from a survey conducted among millennials in Spain and Mexico (N = 1,614) show that more than half of the respondents uploaded an image. Of those, 77.3% and 83.4%, respectively, complied with what the question asked. Moreover, respectively, 52.4% and 65.0% of the images were similarly codified by the Google Vision API and the human coder. In addition, the API codified 1,818 images in less than 5 min, whereas the human coder spent nearly 35 hours to complete the same task.

AB  - To involve Millennials in survey participation, and obtain high-quality answers from them, survey designers may require new tools that better catch Millennials' interest and attention. One key new tool that could improve the communication and make the survey participation more attractive to young respondents are the emojis. We used data from a survey conducted among Millennials by the online fieldwork company Netquest in Spain and Mexico (n = 1614) to determine how emojis can be used in mobile web surveys, in particular in open-ended questions, and how their use can affect data quality, completion time, and survey evaluation. Overall, results show a high willingness of Millennials to use emojis in surveys (both stated and actual use) and a positive impact of encouraging Millennials to use emojis in open-ended questions on the amount of information conveyed, the completion time and the survey enjoyment.

AB  - To compare the effectiveness of different prenotification and invitation procedures in a web-based three-wave access panel survey over 3 consecutive months, we experimentally varied the contact mode in a fully crossed two-factorial design with (a) three different prenotification conditions (mobile short messaging service [SMS], e-mail, no prenotice) and (b) two ?invitation and reminder? conditions (SMS, e-mail). A group with nearly complete mobile phone coverage was randomly assigned to one of these six experimental conditions. As expected, SMS prenotifications outperformed e-mail prenotifications in terms of response rates across all three waves. Furthermore, e-mail invitation response rates outperformed those for SMS invitations. The combination of SMS prenotification and e-mail invitation performed best. The different experimental treatments did not have an effect on the sample composition of respondents between groups.

AB  - One overall aim of this chapter is to identify the prevalence rates of mixed devices (especially smartphones and tablets) in a representative online panel survey in Germany between 2014 and 2016. Moreover, demographic and psychographic determinants of device type usage for online survey participation across time are identified, along with selected consequences of device usage on nonresponse indicators, survey duration, and evaluative judgments regarding the respective surveys. We found that a substantial share of online survey participants do actually use mobile devices, and that nonresponse is most pronounced among smartphone users. We also found that smartphone users perceive surveys as longer and evaluate them less favorable compared to PC/Laptop participants. The presence of others is another characteristic associated with mobile device survey participants, representing a potential source of bias for collecting data on topics sensitive to social influences. The collection of findings presented in this chapter converges against the claim to systematically align the communication strategy, the survey-fielding process, and the incentive scheme with the devices used for survey participation.

AB  - We are more inclined to visit and eat at a frequented restaurant than a restaurant that is notably deserted. Work on social proof can be transposed into the field of digital technologies. We give more credit to an active and nourished discussion forum compared to a deserted forum. Given this link between quantity and quality, it is interesting to consider the way in which the user builds a representation of the amount of information flowing through a digital device. Is this assessment faithful to reality, biased, overestimated, or underestimated? To answer these questions, we implemented fieldwork in which we asked users from a convenience sample to assess the number of different contributors in a discussion forum. The responses are analysed, and the results are discussed.

AB  - This study examines the role and explanatory value of context-, task- and information-related characteristics vis-a-vis individual characteristics in relation with respect to the adoption of mobile technologies and applications. We combine insights from adoption and acceptance literature with media choice and task- technology fit theories. These insights are applied to a case in which police officers use mobile communication tools and information technologies. Officers were asked which mobile applications they preferred to use in specific situations (contexts) and for specific tasks. In a structural equation model focusing exclusively on individual TAM-related characteristics, such as perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, as well as on a generic media fit concept, the explanatory value of these concepts turns out to be high. We extend our study, based on Ajzen and Madden (1986) by arguing that, in addition to personal characteristics, contextual characteristics, in combination with task- related characteristics, play an important role in people's preferences for specific technologies. Conjoint analysis focusing on contextual and task- related characteristics yields relevant insights. When context-related and individual characteristics are combined into a single hierarchical linear model, the significance of the concepts used in TAM turns out to be low, while context- related issues stand out. On the basis of our research, we conclude that TAM models are too generic to fully explain people's intention to use mobile technologies. Future research should aim at developing models that take contextual and task- related factors into account when studying mobile applications.

AB  - This paper examines the effects of survey mode on patterns of survey response, paying special attention to the conditions under which mode effects are more or less consequential. We use the Youth Participatory Politics survey, a study administered either online or over the phone to 2920 young people. Our results provide consistent evidence of mode effects. The internet sample exhibits higher rates of item non-response and "no opinion" responses, and considerably lower levels of differentiation in the use of rating scales. These differences remain even after accounting for how respondents selected into the mode of survey administration. We demonstrate the substantive implications of mode effects in the context of items measuring political knowledge and racial attitudes. We conclude by discussing the implications of our results for comparing data obtained from surveys conducted with different modes, and for the design and analysis of multi-mode surveys.

AB  - Abstract: With the expansion of telecommunication and online technologies for the purpose of survey administration, the issue of measurement validity has come to the fore. The proliferation of automated audio services and computer-based survey techniques has been matched by a corresponding denigration of the quality of traditional phone survey data, most notably as an outcome of falling response rates. This trend, combined with the introduction of screening technologies and answering machines, represents a barrier to the proper execution of survey research. Whereas the question was once, “can technology-assisted surveys achieve the same level of validity as traditional phone surveys?”, the question now becomes, “what are the relative advantages and disadvantages of technology-assisted and phone surveys?” Each has its own challenges and opportunities, and this paper begins to explore these. The present study provides further insight into the validity of telephone and Internet survey data, and explores whether or not the robustness of relationships between variables varies by survey mode. Study data were provided by two surveys, the first of which was conducted in a metropolitan area of the Midwestern US, with interviews of 505 adults using a computer-aided telephone-interviewing (CATI) system. The second was a national survey of 2172 respondents conducted over the Internet by a commercial research firm that sends requests to a diverse set of potential respondents, who logged onto the survey site to participate. Results suggest that weighting in an attempt to achieve parametric matching does seem to increase robustness of relationships and, in this age of poor response rates, this seems to demand an increased use of parametric weightings. Implications of study findings for telematic survey practitioners are discussed. [Copyright &y& Elsevier]

AB  - This article reviews the experience, steps taken, and lessons learnt from including a virtual reality film within a mobile online survey. The survey was designed to test point-of-sale displays within a retail store environment, with respondents exposed to the store using virtual reality within the survey, rather than being a shown a static image or a standard film of the store's interior. The results show how incorporating a virtual reality film within a survey can significantly add to the survey enjoyment compared to traditional approaches. The findings show how the uniqueness of the virtual reality experience can help engage respondents, offering a modern and relevant way to provide a more realistic survey experience that respondents are receptive to. The study also demonstrates that it is technically feasible to incorporate a virtual reality experience into an online survey among typical panelists, without high failure rates or the need to over-incentivise to participate. This article discusses the use of virtual reality within surveys and the practical steps taken to incorporate the virtual reality film, as well as the key !earnings generated from the experience. The future potential for the application of virtual reality technology within research is also explored.

AB  - ObjectiveOur study aimed to measure the percentage of reported olfactory or taste losses and their severity, recovery time, and association with other features in a large cohort of patients with COVID-19.Study DesignProspective survey.SettingQuaternary medical center and online survey.MethodsThe perceived chemosensory capacities of 655 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were assessed with 11-point category rating scales (0, no function; 10, normal function). Patients were contacted in hospital, by phone calls, or by internet regarding their ability to smell or taste, and 143 were interviewed by phone 1 to 4 months later to assess the recovery of their chemosensory abilities.ResultsThe prevalence of self-reported olfactory, general taste, and taste quality?specific disturbances (sweet, sour, bitter, and salty) in the patients with COVID-19 were 82.4% (95% CI, 79.5%-85.3%), 76.2% (95% CI, 72.9%-79.4%), and 52.2% (95% CI, 48.3%-56.1%), respectively. The majority reported anosmia (42.9%). The presence of chemosensory symptoms was not associated with COVID-19 severity. At a median time >2 months after the onset of symptoms, rates of total and partial olfaction recovery were 53.8% and 44.7%, while complete or partial return to previous taste function was 68.3% and 27.6%. Less than 5% of the patients reported no chemosensory function improvement at all.ConclusionThe prevalence of self-reported chemosensory dysfunction is high among patients with COVID-19. Almost all patients seem to recover a significant part of their smell and taste abilities in the first 4 months after the onset of symptoms.

AB  - With the introduction of EU citizenship a set of colliding and overlapping political frames and rights constellations has established new forms of mobility across EU member states. In this regard, respective scholarship has focused particularly on the reach and limits of EU citizenship status and rights. Yet, less attention has been paid to the question of how mobile EU citizens themselves experience these citizenship constellations when they settle into another EU member state. Addressing this question empirically, the article compares EU mobiles’ experiences in two European capital cities, Berlin and Copenhagen. It applies a mixed-method design drawing from data of an online questionnaire and, especially, semi-structured interviews with EU mobiles. A particular focus is put on EU mobiles’ ability to navigate local and national regulations through which EU citizenship is orchestrated. Their experiences shed light on how membership becomes situational and dependent on local and national regulations and contexts, while EU citizenship status and rights are considered less relevant. Against this background, the findings emphasise how bottom-up perspectives to citizenship complement more dominant perspectives in the literature which focus mainly on rights, legal status and political frameworks from the top down.

AB  - Researchers have attempted to estimate the number of congregations in the United States using counts provided by denominations, existing media (newspapers, phone books, websites, etc.), and calculations using congregational surveys. Hadaway and Marler (2005) took the third approach, basing their estimate on the 1998 National Congregations Study (NCS), a representative sample of U.S. congregations, and select official denominational statistics. Since publishing their estimate of 331,000 congregations in 1998, two subsequent waves of the NCS have been conducted. Using the same approach, I estimate the number of congregations in 1998, 2006, and 2012. I conclude that congregations probably became more numerous, likely due to growth among nondenominational Protestants and the extraordinarily low death rate of congregations. But I also consider alternative interpretations of the data.

AB  - Many adults with cancer are not enrolled in clinical trials because caregivers do not have the time to match the patient's clinical findings with varying eligibility criteria associated with multiple trials for which the patient might be eligible. The authors developed a point-of-use portable decision support tool (DS-TRIEL) to automate this matching process. The support tool consists of a hand-held computer with a programmable relational database. A two-level hierarchic decision framework was used for the identification of eligible subjects for two open breast cancer clinical trials. The hand-held computer also provides protocol consent forms and schemas to further help the busy oncologist. This decision support tool and the decision framework on which it is based could be used for multiple trials and different cancer sites.

AB  - Objective: Increased rates of suicidal ideation/behavior have been reported in individuals with human immunodeficiency virus infection/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The electronic Columbia-Suicidality Severity Rating Scale (eCSSRS™) is a validated tool for assessment of suicidal risk. The objective of this study was to assess the site perspectives on implementation of the eC-SSRS used in Phase IIIb studies of dolutegravir. Methods: We developed and validated the ViiV eC-SSRS Metrics and Perspectives Site Questionnaire (VEQ). Topics included ease of eC-SSRS administration, agreement with clinical assessment, unreported risk, and confidence in utility of the eC-SSRS. Results: Clinical data from two Phase IIIb studies were reviewed for correlation with the eC-SSRS results. The overall VEQ response rate was 83%. A total of 85% of respondents administered the eC-SSRS by phone, and 34% reported their patients would be unable to complete a web survey. First-time eC-SSRS users made up 64% of the responders; 85% of repeat administrators said implementation became easier over time. One-half said the eC-SSRS accurately predicted risk, and 14% said the eC-SSRS identified previously unreported risk. A total of 65% were somewhat/very confident their patients are being assessed accurately for suicide risk. Conclusion: Results of the eC-SSRS from ARIA and STRIIVING were consistent with the clinical data. The eC-SSRS identified previous unreported risk for suicidality and provided physicians opportunity for follow-up. Respondents felt the eC-SSRS helps them manage suicide risk, and they reported that its administration became easier with experience. Thus, the eC-SSRS is considered a useful tool in this setting.

AB  - Rosenberg (1963, J. Econ. Hist., 23(4), 414-443) analyzed innovation in the 19th and early 20th century machine tool (MT) industry and its industrializing customers. This paper re-applies his analysis to the invention and application of information and communications technologies (ICTs) in the 20th and 21st centuries. Rosenberg's ideas of technological convergence and of collective learning that leads to a pool of knowledge in a competitive upstream industry are emphasized. In some ICT market segments, the primary customer is a technologist; for these segments, Rosenberg's analysis works quite well. The core reason appears to be that there, as Rosenberg said of MTs, the analysis can go forward on a "purely technological level." In the commercially oriented ICT market segments where most value has been created, this assumption fails. Difficulties at the boundary between purely technological innovation and commercial innovations change the analysis considerably. The locus of accumulating knowledge, the path of technological change through the economy, the structure of the industry supplying the general components and the degree of sharing of technical advances across firms and industries, all change in an easily explained way. The idea of the boundary between two complementary bodies of knowledge may be important. The idea that commercial innovation can be unlike technical invention may be important.

AB  - Election studies must optimize on sample size, cost and data quality. The 2015 Canadian Election Study was the first CES to employ a full mixed-mode design, aiming to take advantage of the opportunities of each mode while preserving enough commonality to compare them. This paper examines the phone interviews conducted by ISR-York and the online questionnaires from panellists purchased from a sample provider. We compare data quality and representativeness. We conduct a comprehensive comparison of the distributions of responses across modes and a comparative analysis of inferences about voting. We find that the cost/power advantages of the online mode will likely make it the mode of choice for subsequent election studies.

AB  - Although software engineers extensively use a component-based software engineering (CBSE) approach, existing usability questionnaires only support a holistic evaluation approach, which focuses on the usability of the system as a whole. Therefore, this paper discusses a component-specific questionnaire for measuring the perceived ease-of-use of individual interaction components. A theoretical framework is presented for this compositional evaluation approach, which builds on Taylor's layered protocol theory. The application and validity of the component-specific measure is evaluated by re-examining the results of four experiments. Here, participants were asked to use the questionnaire to evaluate a total of nine interaction components used in a mobile phone, a room thermostat, a web-enabled TV set and a calculator. The applicability of the questionnaire is discussed in the setting of a new usability study of an MP3 player. The findings suggest that at least part of the perceived usability of a product can be evaluated on a component-based level.

AB  - There is increasing interest in experiments where outcomes are measured by surveys and treatments are delivered by a separate mechanism in the real world, such as by mailers, door-to-door canvasses, phone calls, or online ads. However, common designs for such experiments are often prohibitively expensive, vulnerable to bias, and raise ethical concerns. We show how four methodological practices currently uncommon in such experiments have previously undocumented complementarities that can dramatically relax these constraints when at least two are used in combination: (1) online surveys recruited from a defined sampling frame (2) with at least one baseline wave prior to treatment (3) with multiple items combined into an index to measure outcomes and, (4) when possible, a placebo control. We provide a general and extensible framework that allows researchers to determine the most efficient mix of these practices in diverse applications. Two studies then examine how these practices perform empirically. First, we examine the representativeness of online panel respondents recruited from a defined sampling frame and find that their representativeness compares favorably to phone panel respondents. Second, an original experiment successfully implements all four practices in the context of a door-to-door canvassing experiment. We conclude discussing potential extensions.

AB  - Background: Most smokers attempting to quit relapse. There is little evidence whether the use of e-cigarettes (‘vaping’) increases or decreases relapse. This study aimed to assess 1) whether vaping predicted relapse among ex-smokers, and 2) among ex-smokers who vaped, whether vaping characteristics predicted relapse. Methods: Longitudinal web-based survey of smokers, recent ex-smokers and vapers in the UK, baseline in May/June 2016 (n = 3334), follow-up in September 2017 (n = 1720). Those abstinent from smoking ≥ 2 months at baseline and followed up were included. Aim 1: Relapse during follow-up was regressed onto baseline vaping status, age, gender, income, nicotine replacement therapy use and time quit smoking (n = 374). Aim 2: Relapse was regressed onto baseline vaping frequency, device type, nicotine strength and time quit smoking (n = 159). Results: Overall, 39.6% relapsed. Compared with never use (35.9%), past/ever (45.9%; adjOR = 1.13; 95% CI, 0.61–2.07) and daily vaping (34.5%; adjOR = 0.61; 95% CI, 0.61–1.89) had similar odds of relapse, for non-daily vaping evidence of increased relapse was inconclusive (65.0%; adjOR = 2.45; 95% CI, 0.85–7.08). Among vapers, non-daily vaping was associated with higher relapse than daily vaping (adjOR = 3.88; 95% CI, 1.10–13.62). Compared with modular devices (18.9% relapse), tank models (45.6%; adjOR = 3.63; 95% CI, 1.33–9.95) were associated with increased relapse; evidence was unclear for disposable/cartridge refillable devices (41.9%; adjOR = 2.83; 95% CI, 0.90–8.95). Nicotine strength had no clear association with relapse. Conclusion: Relapse to smoking is likely to be more common among ex-smokers vaping infrequently or using less advanced devices. Research into the effects of vaping on relapse needs to consider vaping characteristics. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study investigates whether it is the case that representativity is undermined if personal computer, tablet and smartphone respondents differ in sociodemographic characteristics and display different survey completion rates. Online market research is struggling with sample representativity. The analysis of more than ten million survey invitations, as well as stated device preference information, suggests that web survey respondents who are members of online panels still mostly use their personal computers, but do express increasing interest in using smartphones and tablets. Survey completion rates do vary across devices, and device use is significantly associated with socio-demographic characteristics and length of membership on a panel. Therefore, researchers must not limit respondents to use a specific device for completing a survey as this may compromise the quality of the survey completion experience, increase non response error and negatively affect representativity.

AB  - We examined whether emerging adults would engage in mobile phone use (MPU) when given the opportunity to socialize face-to-face with a close friend in a laboratory setting. Sixty-three U.S. college student friendship dyads rated their friendship quality in an online survey before coming into the laboratory together. When they arrived for their appointment, they were asked to wait together in a room for 5 min. A hidden camera recorded each dyad. Friends then separately rated the quality of the interaction. We coded time spent using mobile phone in seconds. A hierarchical regression conducted at the level of the dyad controlling for friendship quality and gender showed that more MPU was associated with lower quality interactions. We discuss findings in terms of the potential for MPU to interfere with the development of friendship intimacy.

AB  - Young drivers exhibit high levels of risky driving behaviour, including texting while driving (TWD). The aim of this study was to examine the influence of personality (rash impulsivity, reward seeking), fear of missing out (FOMO) and mobile phone involvement (MPI) on frequency of TWD. Six hundred and twelve young drivers aged 17 to 24 years completed an online survey including these measures, and frequency of sending and reading TWD in the prior week. Rash impulsivity and reward seeking, as well as MPI, predicted both modes of TWD, while FOMO only predicted sending. In addition, rash impulsivity, reward seeking and FOMO all had significant indirect effects on sending and reading TWD via MPI.

AB  - In an ideal world, once you have decided you want an academic job—whether at a large research university, a small teaching university, or one of the many positions in between—you peruse the job ads posted online and find several positions that fit your research and teaching interests perfectly. You send out your application to the respective search committees. Within a few weeks, you receive either a phone call or an email from the chair of the search committee asking if you are still interested in the position. Assuming you are still interested, this person will help you make arrangements to come to the university for several days for an extended interview and formal talk. While at the interview (which lasts for two days and continues throughout all of your meals), you show interest in the department and university and highlight how your research and teaching fits well with their needs. You ask thought-provoking, yet uncontroversial questions. You give a dazzling and well organized job talk that convinces the audience that your work and teaching style are impressive. Although they must interview two more people for the position, and thus you must wait another few weeks to hear, they finally call you with a job offer which you gladly accept.

AB  - We examined whether emerging adults would engage in mobile phone use (MPU) when given the opportunity to socialize face-to-face with a close friend in a laboratory setting. Sixty-three U.S. college student friendship dyads rated their friendship quality in an online survey before coming into the laboratory together. When they arrived for their appointment, they were asked to wait together in a room for 5 min. A hidden camera recorded each dyad. Friends then separately rated the quality of the interaction. We coded time spent using mobile phone in seconds. A hierarchical regression conducted at the level of the dyad controlling for friendship quality and gender showed that more MPU was associated with lower quality interactions. We discuss findings in terms of the potential for MPU to interfere with the development of friendship intimacy.

AB  - This study critically compares offline focus groups, online focus groups and email discussions with respect to their depth, breadth, efficiency, group dynamics, non-verbal impressions and respondent attitudes. In addition, we add an important element to the email discussion—a feedback loop (e-Delphi)—that can strengthen this form of qualitative research. Discussions in an online focus group take place in a virtual discussion room, where all respondents can view and react to the comments of the moderator and their fellow participants. All respondents are online at the same time, which allows for direct interactions and a synchronous group discussion. The moderator, similar to those in traditional focus groups, plays an important role by leading discussions, asking questions, clarifying ambiguities, summarizing the discussion and ensuring that all important aspects of the research question are discussed. Special online focus group software gives the researcher plenty of opportunities to guide the group discussion. Respondents do not need any special software—a computer and internet connection are sufficient. The central research question for all three methods involves examining the expectations and attitudes of the target groups with respect to mobile phones and mobile internet via general packet radio service (GPRS). All three methods include two different types of respondent, recruited from an existing internet panel according to demographic requirements, The results from our study show that online and offline focus groups and e-Delphi methods differ greatly in terms of their results. All three have their own unique characteristics that influence their degree of suitability for handling specific research situations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study described the multimodal communication patterns of college students and their parents, and examined how face-to-face and mediated communication frequencies relate to parental idealization and relational quality. Undergraduate students (N = 678) completed an online survey that assessed indicators of idealization (idealistic distortion and positive affect thinking), relational quality (relational/communication satisfaction, and relational closeness), and the frequency of face-to-face and mediated parental communication. Results indicated that average college students communicate with their primary parent 23 times per week, mostly via phone calls, text messaging, and face-to-face interaction. The frequency of mediated communication was positively related to both indicators of idealization and both indicators of relational quality. Moreover, idealization partially mediated the relationship between mediated communication frequency and relational quality. The frequency of face-to-face communication was inversely related to positive affect thinking. Indirect effects were also detected, such that face-to-face communication was negatively related to both indicators of relational quality as a function of positive affect thinking. Finally, this study examined whether students experience different levels of parental idealization and relational quality depending on whether their parent is geographically close or geographically distant, and whether they reside with their parent. Results indicated that students who live geographically distant from their parent experienced greater levels of idealization and relational quality than did student who live geographically close to yet separate from their parent, who reported greater levels of idealization and relational quality than students who live with their parent. These results were interpreted using concepts from interpersonal, family, and computer-mediated communication. Limitations and directions for future research were discussed.

AB  - The widespread usage of smartphones, as well as their technical features, offers many opportunities for survey research. As a result, the importance and popularity of smartphone surveys is steadily increasing. To explore the feasibility of a new text-to-web approach for surveying people directly via their smartphones, we conducted a case study in Germany in which we recruited respondents from a mobile random digit dialing sample via text messages that included a link to a web survey. We show that, although this survey approach is feasible, it is hampered by a number of issues, namely a high loss of numbers at the invitation stage, and a high rate of implicit refusals on the landing page of the survey.

AB  - This study aims to determine the factors that influence user intention to use location-based emergency applications. The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) is used as a fundamental theory by adding other relevant variables: trust, privacy concern, and fear of crime. Data were collected through questionnaires distributed to the users of the X-Igent Panic Button application. A total of 348 data were collected online using random sampling and processed using structural equation modeling. This study concludes that this application adoption's determinant factors are performance expectancy, trust, social influence, fear of crime, and collection as privacy concerns. These factors become significant predictors of behavioral intention by explaining about 60.5% of the total variation. The study also concludes that trust in services or service providers has the most significant positive impact on the behavioral intention to use location-based mobile applications in emergencies.

AB  - Context: Given the power and pervasiveness of technology, this paper considers whether it can help doctors to access, use and share knowledge and thus contribute to their ability to uphold the part of the Hippocratic Oath concerned with respecting ‘the hard‐won scientific gains of those physicians in whose steps I walk’ and sharing ‘such knowledge as is mine with those who are to follow’. How technology supports connections between doctors and knowledge is considered by focusing on the use of mobile technology in the workplace and Web 2.0 tools. Methods: Sfard's ‘acquisition’ and ‘participation’ models are employed to help develop an understanding of what these uses of technology mean for learning and knowledge sharing. Discussion: The employment of technology is not neutral in its effects. Issues relate to knowledge ownership, information overload, quality control and interpretations attached to the use of mobile devices in the workplace. These issues raise deeper questions about the nature of knowledge and social theory and socio‐material research questions about the effect of technology on workplace learning. Conclusion: Although the empirical and theoretical evidence presented shows how technology has clear potential to contribute both to accessing evidence and sharing knowledge, there is need for further research that applies theoretical frameworks to the analysis of the impact of technology on workplace learning.

AB  - Industrial equipment such as ruggedized handheld computers, scanners, and label printers used within asset tracking environments are expensive to purchase and costly to repair. For organizations that use this equipment, there is value in understanding when and why damage occurs and how much of those costs are potentially associated with the employees’ own sense of psychological ownership and organizational pride. Given the connection between psychological ownership and pride, the purpose of this study was to analyze employee surveys to determine what methods, tools, or programs could reduce repair and replacement while developing a stronger sense of ownership for ruggedized devices used in material‐handling industries by shift workers. Unstructured interviews about device repair with management from a large industrial company were utilized to create a multiple‐choice, anonymous online survey (n = 353). Of the six interventions proposed, assigning the same device to the same employee every shift appeared to have the most consistent and positive response. Destruction rates and costs should be posted for employee viewing and managers of workgroups with consistently high destruction rates should receive additional training. An incentive‐based program for employees responsible for the least amount of device damage as well as an individual‐assignment of devices to employees may be considered. Applications for this student include providing a tool with which organizations can use to gauge employee ownership of equipment as well as to identify interventions that may aid in mitigating expenses associated with industrially rugged equipment.

AB  - Background: Psychosocial stress contributes to heart disease in part by adversely affecting maintenance of health behaviors, while exercise can reduce stress. Assessing the bi-directional relationship between stress and exercise has been limited by lack of real-time data and theoretical and statistical models. This lack may hinder efforts to promote exercise maintenance. Purpose: We test the bi-directional relationship between stress and exercise using real-time data for the average person and the variability—individual differences—in this relationship. Methods: An observational study was conducted within a single cohort randomized controlled experiment. Healthy young adults, (n = 79) who reported only intermittent exercise, completed 12 months of stress monitoring by ecological momentary assessment (at the beginning of, end of, and during the day) and continuous activity monitoring by Fitbit. A random coefficients linear mixed model was used to predict end-of-day stress from the occurrence/non-occurrence of exercise that day; a logistic mixed model was used to predict the occurrence/non-occurrence of exercise from ratings of anticipated stress. Separate regression analyses were also performed for each participant. Sensitivity analysis tested all models, restricted to the first 180 days of observation (prior to randomization). Results: We found a significant average inverse (i.e., negative) effect of exercise on stress and of stress on exercise. There was significant between-person variability. Of N = 69, exercise was associated with a stress reduction for 15, a stress increase for 2, and no change for the remainder. We also found that an increase in anticipated stress reported the previous night or that morning was associated with a significant 20–22% decrease (OR = 0.78–0.80) in the odds of exercising that day. Of N = 69, this increase in stress reduced the likelihood of exercise for 17, increased the odds for 1, and had no effect for the remainder. We were unable to identify psychosocial factors that moderate the individual differences in these effects. Conclusions: The relationship of stress to exercise can be uni- or bi-directional and varies from person to person. A precision medicine approach may improve exercise uptake.

AB  - Personal digital assistants (PDA), particularly Palm Pilots, are popular data collection devices in experience sampling research. The declining availability of such devices, however, has prompted researchers to explore alternative technologies for signaling participants and collecting responses. The present research considers interactive voice response (IVR) methods, which can deliver questions and collect data using common cell phones. Participants completed an experience sampling study using either a PDA (n = 428) or a cell phone under three different conditions (IVR condition n = 98; IVR Callback condition n = 93; IVR Callback Comeback condition n = 94). We found that response rates were higher when people used PDAs (69%) than when they used their cell phones (IVR condition = 51%), but response rates increased when people could call back within a few minutes of missing a signal (IVR Callback condition = 58%) and had a face-to-face meeting with a researcher midweek (IVR Callback Comeback = 64%). The daily life ratings were similar across the conditions. The findings are encouraging for researchers interested in using IVR cell phone methods for ecological momentary assessment, but more work is needed to develop procedures or incentives that increase response rates.

AB  - The Model for Assistance in the Orientation of a User within Coding Systems (MAOUSSC) project has been designed to provide a representation for medical and surgical procedures that allows several applications to be developed from several viewpoints. It is based on a conceptual model, a controlled set of terms, and Web server development. The design includes the UMLS knowledge sources associated with additional knowledge about medico-surgical procedures. The model was implemented using a relational database. The authors developed a complete interface for the Web presentation, with the intermediary layer being written in PERL. The server has been used for the representation of medico-surgical procedures that occur in the discharge summaries of the national survey of hospital activities that is performed by the French Health Statistics Agency in order to produce inpatient profiles. The authors describe the current status of the MAOUSSC server and discuss their interest in using such a server to assist in the coordination of terminology tasks and in the sharing of controlled terminologies.

Two possible approaches to mitigate the problem are Contextual Cues, i.e. visualizing abstract shapes in the border region of the view area to function as visual references to off-screen objects of interest, and Overview + Detail, i.e., simultaneously displaying a detail view and a small-scale overview of the information space. In this paper, we compare the effectiveness of two different Contextual Cues techniques, Wedge (Gustafson et al., 2008) and Scaled Arrows (Burigat et al., 2006), and a classical Overview + Detail visualization that highlights the location of objects of interest in the overview. The study involved different spatial tasks and investigated the scalability of the considered visualizations, testing them with two different numbers of off-screen objects. Results were multifaceted. With simple spatial tasks, no differences emerged among the visualizations. With more complex spatial tasks, Wedge had advantages when the task required to order off-screen objects with respect to their distance from the display window, while Overview + Detail was the best solution when users needed to find those off-screen objects that were closest to each other. Finally, we found that even a small increase in the number of off-screen objects negatively affected user performance in terms of accuracy, especially in the case of Scaled Arrows, while it had a negligible effect in terms of task completion times. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The decade of the 2000s has witnessed the rise of the iPod, a well-marketed mp3 player whose massive storage capacity and ever-shrinking size has extended the boundaries of personal music players to previously unthinkable proportions. And as digital music has expanded its own boundaries, it has spilled over several others, allowing us the opportunity to reconsider many of our musical assumptions. Specifically, I examine the iPod in relation to production and marketing techniques, human-technological hybridity, music hermeneutics, genre distinctions, male music collecting stereotypes, and the urban experience in New York City. The major assumption from which this work proceeds is that the iPod's relationship to culture is dynamic; the iPod doesn't wholly shape culture, nor is it wholly shaped by culture. Rather, each influences and alters the other, as culture and product evolve alongside one another. The primary theme that runs through this study is the listener's relationship to a listening device. How does a music medium affect the way we hear music, and how do our listening habits dictate the functions of an mp3 player? By keeping these questions in the foreground, I privilege contemporary listening habits in order to best understand not only the iPod, but also broader popular music culture in the early twenty-first century.

AB  - The viewing of television programming on screens other than a television set has become increasingly common. This article discusses the different modes of viewing that have emerged as a result of timeshifting, downloading, streaming and mobile technologies. Using data collected from an online survey (n = 671) over a six-month period in 2010?2011, we present a descriptive and inferential statistical analysis of both traditional and emerging modes of viewing. We also examine whether significant differences exist across three demographic variables: gender, age and country or region of residence. Our findings show that while the majority of viewing still takes place in front of a television screen, the computer has achieved secondary screen status among North Americans and equal status among younger viewers and Europeans. Viewing on a mobile device remains minimal across all demographics.

AB  - With nearly 50% of U.S. mobile phone subscribers using smartphones, survey researchers are beginning to explore their use as a data collection tool. The Got Healthy Apps Study (GHAS) conducted a randomized experiment to compare mode effects for a survey completed via iPhone mobile browser and online via desktop/laptop computer web browser. Mode effects were assessed for three types of outcomes: randomization/recruitment, survey process/completion, and survey items. In short, the distribution of survey completion times and the distribution of the number of apps owned were significantly different across survey mode after accounting for block group. Other key mode effects outcomes (including open-ended items, slider bar questions, and missing item rates) showed no significant differences across survey mode. Some interesting qualitative findings suggest that iPhone respondents enter more characters and omit fewer items than originally thought.

AB  - Despite higher hit rates for cell phone samples, inefficiencies in processing calls to these numbers relative to landline numbers continue to be documented in the U. S. literature. In this study, we propose one method for using cell phone provider information and Internet resources for validating number status. Specifically, we describe how we used "in network'' options available from three major providers' web sites to determine the validity of cell phone numbers. We tested differences in working number rates (WNRs) among valid and nonvalid numbers against a normal processing control group and determined that the WNR among valid numbers was approximately 14 percentage points higher than the WNR of the comparison group. This process also shows promise in reducing the effort required to determine working status and may provide a basis for developing screening tools for cell phones that capitalize on resources that are unique to this technology.

AB  - Each day more and more Internet of Things (IoT) devices are being connected to the Internet. In general, their applications are diverse but from the security perspective, it is evident that they are increasingly targeted by cybercriminals and used for nefarious purposes. Network covert channels form a subgroup of the information-hiding research area where secrets are sent over communication networks embedded within the network traffic. Such techniques can be used, among others, by malware developers to enable confidential data exfiltration or stealth communications. Recently, distributed network covert channels have raised the attention of security professionals as they allow the cloaking of secret transmission by spreading the covert bits among many different types of data-hiding techniques. However, although there are many works dealing with IoT security, little effort so far has been devoted in determining how effective the covert channels threat can be in the IoT henvironments. That is why, in this article, we present an extensive analysis on how distributed network covert channels that utilize network traffic from IoT devices can be used to perform efficient secret communication. More importantly, we do not focus on developing novel data-hiding techniques but, instead, considering the nature of IoT traffic, we investigate how to combine existing covert channels so the resulting data transfer is less visible. Moreover, as another contribution of our work, we prepare and share with the community the network traffic dataset that can be used to develop effective countermeasures against such threats.

AB  - This article analyses the modes of physical access that facilitate participation in digital opportunities and the development of digital skills in children and adolescents (9 to 17 years old). We analysed the data obtained from the Kids Online survey in Chile. A latent class analysis (LCA) was conducted to identify groups based on access points and devices of use; access modalities were then composed crossing these variables. Four access modalities were found: cellphone-home; cellphone-ubiquitous; multi-device-home; multi-device-ubiquitous. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that ubiquitous modalities (multi-device and cellphone varieties) predicted digital use and skills among young Chileans, while the more static modalities (cellphone and home and multi-device and home) did not. These results are critical to addressing what can be defined as "enabling access" among young Internet users in the context of digital inclusion policies. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Remote driving operations represents an area of growing promise to exercise human driving capability rather than replace it. Autonomous driving technology is often motivated towards removing humans from the control loop of driving but up to now, has not been able to fully realize such aims. This paper summarizes two experiments that were conducted to investigate viability aspects of emulated teledriving from the point of view of a teledriver and of telepassengers. In the first experiment, a test driver improved lateral lane conformance across a closed-course track after only a few laps while experiencing novel arrangements of live-filmed driving camera and display views. In the second experiment, acceptance ratings from online survey respondents showed prominent negative scores only after viewing simulated driving videos with up to 20x to 50x the steering angle error of a modeled tele-steering device. Together, these studies suggest plausibility for teledriving and promise for future human factors research in this area.

AB  - This article presents a research device (drawn up by the 'Observatoire francais des drogues et des toxicomanies' or OFDT) for exploring drug consumption practices among 'hard-to-reach users'. The OFDT's aim is to put forward a coherent and precise understanding of phenomena relating to drug use and to monitor developments from a national perspective, despite regional differences. The scope of observation focusses on the primary areas of drug use in France. The analysis over time of quantitative and qualitative data also made it possible to divide up the theoretical and heterogeneous unit formed by drug users (DUs) in terms of population types and sub-populations. They have different characteristics and engage in different practices, which do not always develop in the same way. Sometimes they are geographically unstable. The OFDT's experience of probability studies on DUs or populations with a high prevalence of drug use is applied in a 'capture-recapture' study that aims at estimating the prevalence of problematic drug use in six French cities and a quantitative survey based on a sampling plan with an ethnographically based approach in party environments with a focus on electronic music. These complex sampling studies prove indispensable, in particular in measuring the prevalence of drug use in populations not exclusively made up of drug users. However, we believe that, on their own, they cannot measure a phenomenon or monitor its developments since there are several sources of bias associated with sampling and the collection of data in surveys on hard-to-reach populations. We believe that comparing their results not only with the quantitative data from other sources, in particular the time series collected from users of centres for DUs but also with ethnographic data is indispensable in order to monitor these trends.

AB  - Purpose: The author describes communication patterns and outcomes of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) intervention for individuals with Angelman syndrome. Method: Parents self-administered a web-based survey using Qualtrics software. A series of rating scales and closed questions were used to gather information about individuals’ current methods of communication, including AAC devices they were using. Individuals’ uses of their single most advanced AAC devices were further explored in terms of associated importance, usefulness, success, acceptance, and functional outcomes. Results: Nonsymbolic methods of communication proved to be very important to individuals, as did electronic AAC devices, although to a lesser extent. Individuals tended to have access to more than one electronic device concurrently. Although numerous devices were cited, mobile technologies, particularly iPads, were especially prevalent. This represented a significant change from a previous investigation. Overall, device use was perceived to be frequently important, accepted, successful, and useful in relation to 8 different factors, although ratings across a series of 19 functional outcomes varied. Differences were noted on several measures when individuals’ ages and educational placements were considered. Conclusion: Results suggest a changing landscape in terms of types of devices used, particularly with respect to mobile technologies, and show clear evidence that device use is often, although not uniformly, associated with positive outcomes.

AB  - In this paper, the authors define political individualization as a form of networked individualism. This process consists of two components: social individualization and political networking. Social individualization means that people are becoming less strongly connected to traditional communities and experiencing highly differentiated sociability. Political networking refers to the shift from stable connections to formal political movements to dynamic connections to issue networks. This article attempts to investigate whether this process of political individualization is positively related to the use of new media such as the Internet and mobile telephones. There could be two arguments why these two would be positively related. First, the use of new media drives political individualization; the use of new media stimulates individualization since it creates opportunities for individuals to create social connections outside of existing communities. New media also facilitate the formation of political networks. Second, the use of new media and political individualization are both manifestations of a broader process of societal change. The process of modernization results in increasing autonomy of individuals and growing use of technology. This paper does not test these two explanations but rather investigates whether the grounds for both arguments actually exist. The authors have formulated the following research question: Do the new media create opportunities for political individualization and how are these opportunities used? Data from an international survey (918 web questionnaires) of young people in two European cities -- Florence and Utrecht -- has been used to investigate the research question.

AB  - This paper describes a framework that serves as a reference for classifying user interfaces supporting multiple targets, or multiple contexts of use in the field of context-aware computing. In this framework, a context of use is decomposed into three facets: the end users of the interactive system, the hardware and software computing platform with which the users have to carry out their interactive tasks and the physical environment where they are working. Therefore, a context-sensitive user interface is a user interface that exhibits some capability to be aware of the context (context awareness) and to react to changes of this context. This paper attempts to provide a unified understanding of context-sensitive user interfaces rather than a prescription of various ways or methods of tackling different steps of development. Rather, the framework structures the development life cycle into four levels of abstraction: task and concepts, abstract user interface, concrete user interface and final user interface. These levels are structured with a relationship of reification going from an abstract level to a concrete one and a relationship of abstraction going from a concrete level to an abstract one. Most methods and tools can be more clearly understood and compared relative to each other against the levels of this framework. In addition, the framework expresses when, where and how a change of context is considered and supported in the context-sensitive user interface thanks to a relationship of translation. In the field of multi-target user interfaces is also introduced, defined, and exemplified the notion of plastic user interfaces. These user interfaces support some adaptation to changes of the context of use while preserving a predefined set of usability properties. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim: To examine whether the presence of a mobile phone has a moderating role in the relationship between nurses’ private life telepressure and workplace cognitive failure. Design: Cross‐sectional quantitative study using self‐report questionnaires. Methods: Data were collected between December 2019—January 2020. In total, 849 Registered Nurses from three Belgian hospitals completed the online survey. Data were analysed with hierarchical regression analyses and simple slope tests. Results: Overall, the positive relationship between private life telepressure and workplace cognitive failure was moderated by mobile phone presence. Specifically, the experience of private life telepressure did only relate to higher workplace cognitive failure when nurses kept their mobile phone nearby (i.e. in their pockets). Additional exploratory analyses revealed that this moderation effect only held among nurses in young adulthood and regardless of the notification settings of their mobile phone. Conclusions: The present findings indicate the unintended risk of mobile phone presence at work as it relates to higher workplace cognitive failure in nurses who experience private life telepressure. Ensuring there are clear organizational policies and practises in place to store away personal belongings of healthcare personnel during work hours would therefore seem beneficial for hospitals. Impact: Considering the increased presence of mobile phones nowadays, a more detailed understanding is necessary on how these devices might distract personnel in a healthcare setting. The present study gives further insight into this topic and shows that in particular nurses in young adulthood who experience telepressure towards personal messages report more cognitive failure when their personal mobile phones are present, even when they do not actually use these devices. This furnishes additional evidence in support of hospitals' formal policy to forbid personal mobile phones of healthcare personnel when at work.

AB  - Objective: To compare three potential sources of controlled clinical terminology (READ codes version 3.1, SNOMED International, and Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) version 1.6) relative to attributes of completeness, clinical taxonomy, administrative mapping, term definitions and clarity (duplicate coding rate). Methods: The authors assembled 1929 source concept records from a variety of clinical information taken from four medical centers across the United States. The source data included medical as well as ample nursing terminology. The source records were coded in each scheme by an investigator and checked by the coding scheme owner. The codings were then scored by an independent panel of clinicians for acceptability. Codes were checked for definitions provided with the scheme. Codes for a random sample of source records were analyzed by an investigator for "parent" and "child" codes within the scheme. Parent and child pairs were scored by an independent panel of medical informatics specialists for clinical acceptability. Administrative and billing code mapping from the published scheme were reviewed for all coded records and analyzed by independent reviewers for accuracy. The investigator for each scheme exhaustively searched a sample of coded records for duplications. Results: SNOMED was judged to be significantly more complete in coding the source material than the other schemes (SNOMED* 70%; READ 57%; UMLS 50%; *p < .00001). SNOMED also had a richer clinical taxonomy judged by the number of acceptable first-degree relatives per coded concept (SNOMED* 4.56; UMLS 3.17; READ 2.14, *p < .005). Only the UMLS provided any definitions; these were found for 49% of records which had a coding assignment. READ and UMLS had better administrative mappings (composite score: READ* 40.6%; UMLS* 36.1%; SNOMED 20.7%, *p <. 00001), and SNOMED had substantially more duplications of coding assignments (duplication rate: READ 0%; UMLS 4.2%; SNOMED* 13.9%, *p <. 004) associated with a loss of clarity. Conclusion: No major terminology source can lay claim to being the ideal resource for a computer-based patient record. However, based upon this analysis of releases for April 1995, SNOMED International is considerably more complete, has a compositional nature and a richer taxonomy. It suffers from less clarity, resulting from a lack of syntax and evolutionary changes in its coding scheme. READ has greater clarity and better mapping to administrative schemes (ICD-10 and OPCS-4), is rapidly changing and is less complete. UMLS is a rich lexical resource, with mappings to many source vocabularies. It provides definitions for many of its terms. However, due to the varying granularities and purposes of its source schemes, it has limitations for representation of clinical concepts within a computer-based patient record.

AB  - Objective: Examine the uncertainty management process of individuals with Lynch syndrome (LS).
Methods: 19 phone interviews were conducted with individuals with LS. The interview guide included questions on family communication, risk perceptions, and uncertainty management. Data were analyzed using the constant comparison method to code for emergent themes.
Results: Qualitative analysis found individuals with LS tried to manage their uncertainty through preventive care, but were often confounded by healthcare barriers. Healthcare barriers included cost and insurance issues, absence of coordinated care, insufficient provider knowledge, and lack of patient-centered communication. Participants reported increased uncertainty and anxiety due to these barriers and used alternative uncertainty management strategies such as advocating for themselves with providers, seeking information online, and communicating with family for emotional support.
Conclusion: Healthcare barriers identified in this study exacerbated uncertainty and anxiety for individuals with LS and challenged their ability to engage in preventive care. In response, participants used alternative uncertainty management strategies to reduce their uncertainty, which may have unintended negative consequences.
Practice implications: Findings support the need for providers to partner with specialists in genetics and/or LS to better care for individuals with LS. Findings highlight opportunities for interventions in healthcare to better support individuals with LS. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We investigated the impact of color salience and location of a website link on users' performance, affective experiences and approach-avoidance tendencies with 10 mock mobile Web directories. Task completion times were recorded by a computer program, and users' affective experiences and approach-avoidance responses were reported in questionnaires. Results implied that visual attention in the display area on a mobile Web directory is directed by a combination of bottom-up and top-down processes, which is different from the primarily top-down process implicated in a similar study of PC Web directories. A salient color of the website link helped attract users' attention and increase users' sense of control over the process. Also, users are likely to search webpages from top left to bottom right. Our findings suggest that a target website link placed in the top left corner or displayed in a distinct color in the center area not only attracts users' attention but also results in a more highly rated affective experience. Color of the target website link can be changed to increase users' sense of control of a Web directory and approach behaviors.

AB  - As interfaces between human beings and the digital world, mobile phones have evolved from relatively simple devices (e.g., feature phones) to complex products (e.g., smartphones). Many firms in emerging countries such as China have successfully entered the mobile phone sector. A research question that emerges from the evidence on China is whether the entry strategies of these catching up firms have been affected by the introduction of smartphones. In order to investigate this question, the article follows the methodology of evolutionary theory and history-friendly models. It first examines historically the various strategies of the Chinese entrants in the mobile phone sector. On the basis of this empirical analysis, it then develops appreciative theorizing on the factors that have affected the catch-up entry strategies. Our results show that the successful catch-up entry strategies differ depending on the sectoral environment. A technology-driven strategy is more appropriate when there is a market sheltered from competition, so that technological capabilities can be accumulated; on the contrary a marketing-driven strategy is more appropriate when standardized technological solutions become widely available. The article contributes to the catch-up literature by identifying a new entry strategy and by pointing at the role of the sectoral environment, and to the sectoral innovation system literature by addressing the catch-up strategies of latecomer firms under different technological, industrial structure, and market conditions.

AB  - The ‘Mind-Upload’ hypothesis (MU), a radical version of the Brain-in-a-Vat thought experiment, asserts that a whole mind can safely be transferred from a brain to a digital device, after being exactly encoded into substrate independent informational patterns. Prima facie, MU seems the philosophical archenemy of the Embodied Mind theory (EM), which understands embodiment as a necessary and constitutive condition for the existence of a mind and its functions. In truth, whether and why MU and EM are ultimately incompatible is unobvious. This paper, which aims to answer both questions, will not simply confirm that MU and EM actually are incompatible. It will also show the true reason of their incompatibility: while EM implies that a mind’s individual identity is contingent upon the details of its physical constituents, MU presupposes that minds can be relocated from one material vessel to another. A systematic comparison between these conflicting assumptions reveals that the real shortcoming of MU is not the one usually discussed by the philosophical literature: it has nothing to do with MU’s functionalist or computationalist prerequisites, and is only secondarily related to the artificial implementability of consciousness; the real problem is that MU presupposes that minds could still be individuated and numerically identified while being reduced to immaterial formal patterns. EM seems committed to refute this assumption, but does it have sufficient resources to succeed? (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Media usage is pervasive in young children and in parents. The aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of media usage on family functioning. To measure media usage we used the Media Usage Questionnaire (MUQ). To measure the family functioning we used the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales (FACES IV), in which balanced scores (cohesion and flexibility) reveal a healthy functioning, and unbalanced scores reveal a dysfunctional functioning (disengagement, enmeshment, rigidity and chaos). Both instruments were administered to a sample of 80 families with children aged from 1 to 8 years. Results indicated that family functioning was balanced when both parents and young children showed low levels of digital device usage, whereas family functioning was dysfunctional when parents showed high levels of media usage and they allowed children high usage too. The results are discussed in terms of implications for the analysis of risk of altered family functioning.

AB  - This article investigates the role of product upgrades and consumer switching costs in the tying of complementary products. Previous analyses have found that a monopolist of one product will not increase its profits and reduce social welfare by tying and leveraging its monopoly position into a complementary market if the initial monopolised product is essential, where essential means that all uses of the complementary good require the initial monopolised product. We show that this is not true in settings characterised by product upgrades and consumer switching costs. We also discuss various extensions including the role of the reversibility of tying. © 2011 Royal Economic Society.

AB  - Commonly used screening tools for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) generally rely on subjective caregiver questionnaires. While behavioral observation is more objective, it is also expensive, time-consuming, and requires significant expertise to perform. As such, there remains a critical need to develop feasible, scalable, and reliable tools that can characterize ASD risk behaviors. This study assessed the utility of a tablet-based behavioral assessment for eliciting and detecting one type of risk behavior, namely, patterns of facial expression, in 104 toddlers (ASDN= 22) and evaluated whether such patterns differentiated toddlers with and without ASD. The assessment consisted of the child sitting on his/her caregiver's lap and watching brief movies shown on a smart tablet while the embedded camera recorded the child's facial expressions. Computer vision analysis (CVA) automatically detected and tracked facial landmarks, which were used to estimate head position and facial expressions (Positive, Neutral, All Other). Using CVA, specific points throughout the movies were identified that reliably differentiate between children with and without ASD based on their patterns of facial movement and expressions (area under the curves for individual movies ranging from 0.62 to 0.73). During these instances, children with ASD more frequently displayed Neutral expressions compared to children without ASD, who had more All Other expressions. The frequency of All Other expressions was driven by non-ASD children more often displaying raised eyebrows and an open mouth, characteristic of engagement/interest. Preliminary results suggest computational coding of facial movements and expressions via a tablet-based assessment can detect differences in affective expression, one of the early, core features of ASD. Lay Summary This study tested the use of a tablet in the behavioral assessment of young children with autism. Children watched a series of developmentally appropriate movies and their facial expressions were recorded using the camera embedded in the tablet. Results suggest that computational assessments of facial expressions may be useful in early detection of symptoms of autism.

AB  - Aim: This study aims to address the gap in research and contribute to the body of knowledge on the perspectives assistive technology device users have toward their devices. Method: Mixed methods were used to better understand the impact of mobility assistive technology devices (MATDs) on participation for individuals with disabilities. The Functional Mobility Assessment was administered in conjunction with two qualitative questions developed by the research team allowing participants to expound on the impact of their MATD experience. Participants were recruited online via the National Spinal Cord Injury Association website and in-person at Abilities Expo in Atlanta, Georgia, and the International Seating Symposium in Nashville, Tennessee. Results: Results are consistent with findings from prior research regarding accessibility for individuals with disabilities. Corresponding findings were found in both the quantitative and qualitative data and are categorized into several major themes: environment (indoor and outdoor), surface heights, transportation, dependence, independence, quality of life and participation. Conclusion: Quantitative data from this study indicate that users of MATD are satisfied with the way in which their devices enable maneuvering indoors, while qualitative data suggest otherwise. Implications for healthcare practitioners are described and future recommendations are provided. Implications for Rehabilitation: 1. Healthcare professionals should advocate for proper mobility assistive technology devices (MATDs) for their patients in order to enable increased independence, safety and efficiency. 2. Healthcare professionals must be cognizant of the impact of the environment and/or environmental barriers when prescribing MATD. 3. Additional areas of interest for future research may include investigating the impact of MATD in association with date of onset of disability, according to diagnoses, or specific to length of time since acquiring the device.

AB  - The central question of this study is whether the public and regulatory policy for the promotion of competition and digital inclusion of the Telecommunications Reform in Mexico (2013–2018) had a statistically significant effect on greater adoption of telecommunications services. In order to answer this question, the article analyzes the effects of the public and regulatory policy on promoting competition, which has been one of the main objectives of the Reform, due to its effects on prices, adoption, and in the quality of the services, in addition to offering greater legal certainty to the investment. It also examines the public policy of digital inclusion; the constitutional amendments that decreed access to broadband as a fundamental right of all Mexicans. This study also carries out an analysis using two econometric tools; the first consists of the fixed effects analysis and the second, of the synthetic control method, in which the case of Mexico is contrasted with that of other economies in Latin America with similar levels of development. The two econometric exercises consistently confirm that the institutional, regulatory, and digital inclusion policy changes associated with the Reform have not yet had a statistically significant effect on the adoption of telecommunications services. The gap is particularly evident in the case of mobile cellular services, in which Mexico shows an important lag. The social policy in telecommunications has not been able to reverse this trend of lag in the adoption. The findings on the limitations of this social coverage policy lead us to conclude that the government faces difficulties in offering an adequate response through a public policy of digital inclusion.

AB  - Background: With advancing marijuana legalization in the United States, a primary concern is the possible increase in consequences relating to marijuana driving impairment, especially among people who use high-potency marijuana (i.e., extracts). In this study, the research team assessed the risk perception and experiences of driving under the influence of marijuana by investigating people who use extracts. Methods: Participants from 2 studies were queried about driving after using marijuana. In Study 1, phone interviews (n = 19) were conducted with people who use extracts. In Study 2, people who use extracts (n = 174) were recruited to participate in a nationwide survey via an online existing panel. Responses to marijuana and driving–related questions were qualitatively coded for themes (e.g., riskiness, engagement in behavior) developed by the research team. Results: Prominent themes identified in Study 1 suggested a belief that driving risk following marijuana use is dependent on the individual (i.e., response/tolerance) or the amount/type of marijuana consumed. This theme was corroborated by Study 2 participants. Those who perceived no or minimal risk from driving following marijuana use were more likely to report engagement in driving following extracts use. Conclusions: More research is needed to understand how marijuana, especially in its concentrated form, impacts driving ability in order to develop appropriate and scientifically sound regulations. Such research could subsequently fill the need to improve and more widely disseminate prevention messages on marijuana use and driving risks.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the social adoption of the mobile phone by Irish teenagers in city, town and rural settings. It aims to investigate two key areas that have influenced the teenagers' social adoption of the mobile phone: first, the influence of locational and socio-economic factors on mobile phone usage; second, how the teenagers' adoption of recently emergent Web 2.0 applications (social-networking web sites and instant messaging services) tends to bring about a re-positioning of the mobile phone's role as a communications channel.
Design/methodology/approach - The paper draws on a social shaping and domestication of media technologies approach, using original empirical data from a survey of teenage respondents and six focus groups.
Findings - The findings suggest that the teenagers' relationship to the mobile phone is evolving as newer communications applications emerge. In particular, the technical competencies and media literacies necessary for multi-model communication are evolving fastest where locational and socio-economic conditions are most favourable.
Originality/value - Although access to the mobile phone cuts across the strata of society, people's capacity to benefit from it - and from other forms of multi-modal communication - is not evenly distributed. The paper argues that, despite universal ownership of the technological device among the sample of teenagers, the mobile phone is caught up in wider digital and socio-economic divides.

AB  - This paper examines the early stages of VoIP usage by analyzing the relationship between the usage of VoIP services and other voice and non-voice communication services in Italy. In doing so, it aims at filling the gap in the empirical literature on the diffusion of VoIP among consumers and aims at investigating the relationship between VoIP adoption and the usage of telecom and Internet-related services. It relies upon a survey carried out among consumers in Italy in 2006. The use of VoIP is negatively associated with the usage of other voice communication services -- mobile communications in particular, but shows some degree of complementarity with other non-voice (Internet-based) communication services, suggesting that familiarity with the web plays a significant and positive role in explaining the adoption of VoIP applications. Furthermore, individual users' technical skills, job position and communications' habits also matter in determining the adoption of VoIP. [Copyright Elsevier Inc.]

AB  - Surveys continue to be a popular way of collecting data in the social sciences. But, despite their popularity they have a number of limitations including the possibility of changing the behaviour of respondents. Such mere-measure or question-behaviour effects can compromise the external validity of social data. In this article, we use digital trace data collected from PCs and mobile devices to investigate the effects of surveys on news and politics consumption. Using a non-probability panel of respondents in Germany we combine the digital trace data with that from three online surveys regarding the federal election. In contrast to our expectation, the participation in the survey does not influence online news and politics media consumption. Furthermore, we find weak evidence that respondents with previous high media consumption are less likely to be influenced by doing the survey compared to those with low media consumption.

AB  - Web surveys are struggling to attract and retain respondents due to high burden and competition for the users(') attention. One possible solution to this issue is the improvement of the visual design of surveys. In this article, we evaluate the impact of visual aids such as smiley faces, stars, hearts, and thumbs as alternatives to traditional radio buttons. We use an experimental design in a nonprobability online survey to investigate how the new designs compare with radio buttons and how the results might interact with device used for completion (PC vs mobile), the use of labels, the type of response scale (bipolar vs unipolar), and the number of response categories (5 vs 7 point). While we do not find big differences in response, quality and experience, there seem to be some indication that the use of smiley faces leads to worse data quality.

AB  - Computerized neuropsychological assessment has integrated slowly into research and practice since the introduction of the personal computer. Though initial integration of technology to the laboratory and clinical setting utilized specialized hardware and software, newer generation assessment tools are integrated with "off-the-shelf" operating systems. Further, neuropsychological assessment is beginning to find Internet-based application for remote assessment. As these applications are more broadly applied, it is essential to understand potential errors that can be created both in test administration and in reaction time measurement due to hardware and software interactions. In this article, user considerations are specifically addressed for resident and Internet-enabled assessment software. Potential hardware and software conflicts are defined and potential remediation is suggested. Computerized assessment is a valuable tool for neuropsychologists as long as it is used responsibly with an understanding of the potential technical complications. © 2006 National Academy of Neuropsychology.

AB  - Motivation: Participants on the front lines of abuse reporting have a variety of options to notify intermediaries and resource owners about abuse of their systems and services. These can include emails to personal messages to blacklists to machine-generated feeds. Recipients of these reports have to voluntarily act on this information. We know remarkably little about the factors that drive higher response rates to abuse reports. One such factor is the reputation of the sender. In this article, we present the first randomized controlled experiment into sender reputation. We used a private datafeed of Asprox-infected websites to issue notifications from three senders with different reputations: an individual, a university and an established anti-malware organization. Results: We find that our detailed abuse reports significantly increase cleanup rates. Surprisingly, we find no evidence that sender reputation improves cleanup. We do see that the evasiveness of the attacker in hiding compromise can substantially hamper cleanup efforts. Furthermore, we find that the minority of hosting providers who viewed our cleanup advice webpage were much more likely to remediate infections than those who did not, but that website owners who viewed the advice fared no better.

AB  - In the last decade, journalists have adapted to technological innovations that facilitate the creation of an individual identity online and personal connections with audiences. In parallel, the rise of hypercompetition in the media industry raises questions about the increasing importance of market considerations. Under these conditions, journalists gradually develop promotional practices online. This article examines the scope of these promotional practices among political journalists on Twitter through a content analysis of messages posted by members of the Press Gallery of the Quebec National Assembly. It also analyzes motivations and norms related to these practices through a series of interviews with Press Gallery members. The findings indicate that promotion is an important feature of the production of Quebec parliamentary press on Twitter. The quest for visibility, competition, and the requests made by management teams in a context of economic hardship are key motivations for using Twitter as a promotional device.

AB  - The number of mobile phone subscriptions worldwide reached almost 7 billion in 2013. Therefore, the social and psychological consequences of the technology are of great interest to new media scholars and policy makers. Adopting an affordance-based approach, this study examines how different uses of the mobile phone are related to individuals? subjective well-being and social capital. Findings from a national survey showed that both voice and online communication with the mobile phone is positively related to various indicators of subjective well-being and bonding and bridging capital. Moreover, both bonding and bridging capital mediated the relationship between mobile phone use and subjective well-being. On the other hand, non-communicative uses, such as information seeking activities, were negatively related to positive affect and passing time activities were positively related to negative affect. Implications of the findings are discussed.

AB  - Nowadays consumers can easily connect with others who are pursuing similar goals via smart devices and mobile apps. This technology also enables them to compare how well they are doing relative to others in a variety of contexts, ranging from online gaming to losing weight to loyalty programs. This research investigates consumers' motivation to achieve a goal when they compare themselves with a superior other who has already attained the goal. Building on the literature on social comparison, and on competition in particular, we find that consumers are less motivated when the superior other has attained the goal compared to when the superior other is just ahead, keeping the relative distance equal. This negative effect on motivation is evident even in situations in which consumers can still attain the same goal as the superior other. We argue and demonstrate that this effect occurs because the other's goal attainment limits consumers' prospect to compete and overtake the superior other. Six experimental studies show evidence for this effect in hypothetical loyalty programs and behavioral task completion. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the motivational effect of social comparison, which have implications for marketing managers and public policy makers.

AB  - Digital technologies have redefined how people use audio media, especially for the millennial audience segment. Faced with the challenge from streaming music, many broadcast radio stations have launched their own mobile apps to compete with the new audio services such as Spotify. Guided by the uses and gratifications conceptual framework, this study employed a national survey to investigate millennials? perceptions of the substitutability and complementarity of broadcast radio, its apps, and music streaming services. The results showed that while radio listeners perceived broadcast radio and its apps as similar products, they regarded music streaming services as distinct from the two. In addition, this study examined motivators behind the diverse perceptions and identified information, escapism, entertainment, and socialization as important. The results suggest that radio stations should take advantage of the mobile technology and offer unique values through their apps, rather than duplicate the offline consumption experience.

AB  - Through a large-scale national survey, this study provided the first comprehensive examination of podcast users in the United States from the perspectives of motivation and usage. It deepened our understanding of this new on-demand audio platform in the context of consumption drivers, behaviors, and competing media options. The results showed that entertainment, information, and audio platform superiority were the most important motivators for podcast consumption. In addition, motives were found to affect listening behaviors, including listening settings, width, depth, and routine of listening, and usage of competing audio media, such as regular radio, online radio, and streaming music. The findings revealed that podcasting is a distinct medium with unique characteristics rather than a mobile, on-demand extension of existing audio platforms like radio. Podcast consumption, especially on today?s complex media platforms, is multidimensional and should be measured from multiple aspects and examined in various settings.

AB  - Information and communications technology (ICT)-based government service delivery in India is rapidly achieving a stage of maturity. With the increasing teledensity and the penetration of mobile devices, the Indian central and state governments have started to offer government services over mobile devices. As more and more government services are offered over mobile phones, it is important to gain an understanding of parameters determining the quality of mobile government services. The identification of service quality parameters will help stakeholders appropriately prioritize and position mobile-based government service delivery. This article presents the findings of an exploratory study using an online survey of Indian e-government experts on the service quality parameters for m-government in India. The study aims to identify and prioritize the service quality parameters based on similar parameters identified by researchers for e-government and mobile service quality.

AB  - This study developed and empirically tested a model to predict the factors affecting students’ behavioral intentions toward using mobile learning (m-learning). This study explored the behavioral intention to use m-learning from the perspective of consumers by applying the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model with the addition of perceived enjoyment, mobile self-efficacy, satisfaction, trust, and perceived risk moderators. A cross-sectional study was conducted by employing a research model based on multiple technology acceptance theories. Data were derived from an online survey with 1,562 respondents and analyzed using structural equation modeling. Partial least squares (PLS) regression was used for model and hypothesis testing. The results revealed that (1) behavioral intention was significantly and positively influenced by satisfaction, trust, performance expectancy, and effort expectancy; (2) perceived enjoyment, performance expectancy, and effort expectancy had positive associations with behavioral intention; (3) mobile self-efficacy had a significantly positive effect on perceived enjoyment; and (4) perceived risk had a significantly negative moderating effect on the relationship between performance expectancy and behavioral intention. Our findings correspond with the UTAUT model and provide a practical reference for educational institutions and decision-makers involved in designing m-learning for implementation in universities.

In the original article, corrections by the authors were not made before the publication of the Version of Record. The corrections have now been made; a list of each correction is given in erratum.] As public sector work environments continue to embrace the digital governance revolution, questions of work surveillance practices and its relationship to performance management continue to evolve, but even more dramatically in the contemporary period of many public servants being forced to shift to remote work from home in response to the COVID‐19 pandemic. This article presents the results of three surveys, two of them population‐based survey experiments, all conducted during the onset of the COVID‐19 pandemic in Canada that compare public servant (n = 346) and citizen (n = 1,008 phone; n = 2,001 web) attitudes to various cutting‐edge—though no doubt controversial among some—digital surveillance tools that can be used in the public sector to monitor employee work patterns, often targeted toward remote working conditions. The findings represent data that can help governments and public service associations navigate difficult questions of reasonable privacy intrusions in an increasing digitally connected workforce. Evidence for Practice New work surveillance technologies are available to use within the public sector and will present acceptability challenges to public managers as they contemplate the introduction of these technologies. Multimodal survey data from Canada reveals that public servants and citizens find these emerging work surveillance technologies to be quite intrusive and unreasonable but show relatively more tolerance for digital surveillance over physical surveillance practices. Understanding surveillance anxieties among targeted employees will be key to finding a balance between employee privacy rights and employer desires to manage employees in a remote or digital environment.

This article presents the results of three surveys, two of them population‐based survey experiments, all conducted during the onset of the COVID‐19 pandemic in Canada that compare public servant (n = 346) and citizen (n = 1,008 phone; n = 2,001 web) attitudes to various cutting‐edge—though no doubt controversial among some—digital surveillance tools that can be used in the public sector to monitor employee work patterns, often targeted toward remote working conditions. The findings represent data that can help governments and public service associations navigate difficult questions of reasonable privacy intrusions in an increasing digitally connected workforce. Evidence for Practice New work surveillance technologies are available to use within the public sector and will present acceptability challenges to public managers as they contemplate the introduction of these technologies. Multimodal survey data from Canada reveals that public servants and citizens find these emerging work surveillance technologies to be quite intrusive and unreasonable but show relatively more tolerance for digital surveillance over physical surveillance practices. Understanding surveillance anxieties among targeted employees will be key to finding a balance between employee privacy rights and employer desires to manage employees in a remote or digital environment.

AB  - Executive SummaryThe year 2020 will go down in the annals of history as the year of COVID-19, the year the whole world was left devastated. Even in 2021, countries are being ravaged by the virus, with no immediate end in sight. In fast-moving and uncertain situations, leaders face many questions for which they might not have any answers (Argenti, 2020). Therefore, the question is how leaders can manage the communication environment with clarity, consistency and empathy during this period of extreme disruption (Glinska, 2020). Crisis communication is generally defined as the accumulation and dissemination of information during crisis situations to alleviate the severity of the crisis. This study outlines and analyses the communication strategies and measures adopted by the management of one of the biggest manufacturing industries of the country, the Steel Authority of India Limited, Rourkela Steel Plant (RSP), during this ongoing COVID-19 crisis. A survey on the efficacy of the communication measures adopted by the management was conducted on 345 employees. The results showed a high level of support for all the implemented communication measures. Yet employees at the junior level articulated a need for better communication exchange with the top management. They perceived their voices as going unheard and sought additional communication channels connecting them to the highest authority. Considering the feedback received from the employees, additional communication measures were adopted. RSP?s Mass Contact Exercise was revived in an online format. A mobile app was developed containing all information and guidelines that an employee would need regarding precautions, prevention, testing and treatment of COVID-19. Quick and clear communication at every juncture let RSP tide through arguably the toughest pandemic period. Thus, it should always be ensured that appropriate communication channels are effectively implemented for vital information to reach every corner of the organization.

AB  - Connectivity among societies has increased manifold in a globalized world. Media, mainly digital media, have emerged as an exciting player in the globalization process. It simultaneously augments the globalization process and also fuels ultra-localism- a complex socio-cultural phenomenon. In India, growing smartphone users have been changing the pattern of media content consumption. In the last three years, with the availability of cheap internet data, the Indian audience is consuming more and more online media content. In the entertainment sector, media consumers are showing a significant change in their consumption behaviour. Traditional cinema viewing is gradually being replaced by watching cinema and shows on Over The Top (OTT) media platforms like Amazon Prime, Netflix and other service providers. This paper probes how Indian millennial audiences, mainly the 'Digital Mainstream' has been watching cinema on OTT platforms and why are they switching to mobile devices rather than sticking to the big cinema screens. Are they satisfied with watching the content on a smaller screen or are there still craving for watching on a bigger screen? Is the content different? Is the experience different?. Applying the method of survey and in-depth interviews, this exploratory paper attempts to find an answer to these research questions. Since the entertainment media content creators including the director and producers of cinema are adapting themselves to the behaviour of the audience of the OTT platforms, this paper may throw more light on the behavioural pattern of the young audience so far as taking to the new medium is concerned.

AB  - This paper investigates information and communication technologies for development (ICT4D) projects from around the world. It finds that computer and Internet promotion schemes usually fail despite active support, but mobile penetration in even the poorest countries is deepening organically. It argues that mobiles have emotional appeal because talking is a universal psycho-sociological propensity while the other two are principally utilitarian technologies that have to generate returns on investment. The search for killer apps is likely to be fruitless because technological adoption is conditional upon need and absorptive capacity. The paper raises questions about the continuing support for ICT4D among proponents. Journal of Information Technology (2012) 27, 326-338. doi:10.1057/jit.2012.19; published online 9 October 2012

AB  - AbstractThe purpose of this article is to explore the mediating role of perceived usefulness, trust and attitude on a user?s intention towards use of mobile wallets in India. While mediation has been studied by earlier researchers in the context of online commerce, mobile banking, short message service (SMS) banking, mobile money, etc., not many studies exist in the context of mobile wallets. Considering the potential of mobile wallets in India, previous relationships from the theories of technology adoption like technology acceptance model (TAM) and unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) were adapted to investigate the determinants of user attitude and intention towards mobile wallet adoption. Based on data from 744 respondents collected through a survey, partial least squares (PLS) structural equation modelling was used to test the research model. Convenience sampling was used to select the respondents. The results revealed that out of the nine paths wherein mediation was examined, in two paths full mediation was found while it was partial in the remaining cases. This study extends research in explaining attitude and intention through multiple mediating relationships. The implications for research and practice and future research directions are discussed.

AB  - Comprehension is the goal of reading. However, students often encounter reading difficulties due to the lack of background knowledge and proper reading strategy. Unfortunately, print text provides very limited assistance to one’s reading comprehension through its static knowledge representations such as symbols, charts, and graphs. Integrating digital materials and reading strategy into paper-based reading activities may bring opportunities for learners to make meaning of the print material. In this study, QR codes were adopted in association with mobile technology to deliver supplementary materials and questions to support students’ reading. QR codes were printed on paper prints to provide direct access to digital materials and scaffolded questions. Smartphones were used to scan the printed QR codes to fetch pre-designed digital resources and scaffolded questions over the Internet. A quasi-experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of direct access to the digital materials prepared by the instructor using QR codes and that of scaffolded questioning in improving students’ reading comprehension. The results suggested that direct access to digital resources using QR codes does not significantly influence students’ reading comprehension; however, the reading strategy of scaffolded questioning significantly improves students’ understanding about the text. The survey showed that most students agreed that the integrated print-and-digital-material- based learning system benefits English reading comprehension but may not be as efficient as expected. The implications of the findings shed light on future improvement of the system. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Mobile donation has gained mainstream media attention since the Haiti Earthquake Relief in 2010. Yet, there is still a lack of research on mobile donation as a new venue of technology-mediated civic engagement. Using nationally representative survey data, this research examines the variations in mobile donation by mobile phone usage patterns and user characteristics such as age, race, and socioeconomic status. Results show that the diversity of mobile phone use and the frequency of relational mobile communication are positively associated with mobile donation. As importantly, mobile donation helps to overcome age, race and SES gaps, giving members of disadvantaged social groups a more accessible tool for civic engagement. Internet donation and mobile donation complement rather than compete with each other.

AB  - Authentic videos are always motivational for foreign language learners. According to the findings of many empirical studies, subtitled L2 videos are particularly useful for foreign language learning. Although there are many authentic English videos available on the Internet, most of these videos do not have subtitles. If subtitles can be added to videos, EFL students might better understand the video content and pick up more vocabulary items. To help EFL students make better use of authentic videos, an automatic video and transcript synchronization system called SynctoLearn was developed. The SynctoLearn system uses speech recognition technologies to automatically synchronize voices in audios and videos with their respective transcripts. Two studies were conducted in order to assess the effectiveness of this listening tool and investigate EFL learners’ perception toward this device. In the first study, two college classes at similar proficiency levels were divided in two groups. One group viewed the synchronized video and another viewed the same video without any synchronized subtitles. The group that watched the synchronized video outperformed the other group in summarizing the key points of the video. In the second study, two college EFL classes used the SynctoLearn website for a whole semester and were invited to fill in a questionnaire. Based on the survey results, students indicated that they enjoyed watching synchronized videos. They regarded the design of the SynctoLearn system positively and particularly lauded the options that allowed them to click and replay any video segments and show/hide the subtitles at any time. Students, however, suggested that the video quality and subtitle presentation can be further improved. Moreover, additional learning support such as online dictionaries can be included in the system. The results of the experiment and the survey indicate that the SynctoLearn tool, which provides synchronized subtitles, can be used as a supporting tool to help EFL students reduce their cognitive loads and anxiety levels when tackling authentic videos. The findings and the technologies used in this article should be useful for teachers and researchers who want to use or develop similar tools for foreign language learning.

AB  - This paper presents two studies of the use of the WWW in Scottish universities and American land-grant universities. First, we investigated the relationship between the organisational profile of a university department in Scotland and its structural connectivity on the WWW. A Spearman rank order correlation analysis revealed a number of strong correlation relationships between structural connectivity measures and the organisational profile based on research assessment exercise ratings, teaching quality assessments, student-staff ratios and funding levels. Linkage patterns from 13 Scottish academic sites to commercial sites in Britain and America highlighted the impact of culture and the appropriateness of information technologies on the acceptance of the WWW. The second study is a content survey of WWW-based education activities in American land-grant universities to investigate successful applications of these enabling techniques in education. The two studies together highlighted cultural, political and technological interactions in the use of the WWW. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose In the limited existing research on smartphone addiction, reinforcement reward and automatic habit have been identified as two distinct underlying mechanisms. The purpose of this paper is to better understand the interaction between these two mechanisms, as well as role of smartphone features in activating different formation mechanisms. Design/methodology/approach An online survey with 379 samples was conducted to empirically validate the model. The data were analyzed by structural equation modeling approach. Findings The automatic habit strengthens the driving effects of reinforcement rewards (i.e. perceived enjoyment and mood regulation) on smartphone addiction. Smartphone features activate distinct underlying mechanisms. Value-added function facilitates the perception of reinforcement rewards, while convenience promotes the habit formation. Originality/value This study is one of the first ones that assess the interplay between the two formation mechanisms in the extant literature on smartphone addiction. This study also reveals the dangers of smartphone features which have always been regarded as advantages. The findings contribute to the current understandings of smartphone addiction.

AB  - The research proposes a framework incorporating the flow theory and the theory of planned behaviour to understand the intention of subscribers to expand their use of mobile videophones. The research model was tested with the partial least square graph software based on its structural equation modelling approach. The data used in this research were collected from online questionnaires done by 151 respondents. The findings show that the flow and the subjective norm are positively related to the expanded intention to use mobile videophones and the privacy concern is negatively related to that intention. The results also reveal that the effects of media characteristics such as interactivity and telepresence may have significant influences on the flow. Moreover, the effects of the flow, the subjective norm and the privacy concern are moderated by self-monitoring. Regardless of personality, people are likely to expand the intention to use mobile videophones when they immerse themselves in the flow. Several implications for research and practice are derived from these findings. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to propose user experience sharing (UES) as a customer-based initiation of value co-creation pertaining to service provision, which represents customers’ level of effort made for the direct benefit of others in their service network. The authors propose and empirically examine a user experience sharing model (UESM) that explicates customer-to-customer (C2C) UES and its impacts on firm-desired customer-based outcomes in online communities. Design/methodology/Approach: Based on an extensive review, the authors conceptualize UES and UESM. By using online survey data collected from mobile app users in organic online communities, the authors performed structural equation modeling analyses by using AMOS 24. Findings: The results support the proposed UESM, showing that C2C UES acts as a key driver of both firm-desired customer efforts and customer insights. The results also confirmed that service-dominant (S-D) logic-informed motivational drivers exert a significant impact on C2C UES. Importantly, C2C UES mediates the relationship between S-D logic-informed motivational drivers and firm-desired customer-based outcomes. Originality/value: This study offers a pioneering attempt to develop an overarching concept, UES, which reflects customers’ initiation of value co-creation, and to empirically examine C2C UES. The empirical evidence supports the key contention that firms should proactively facilitate C2C UES. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Purpose As an increasing number of users have acquired information across the web and mobile platforms for social question and answering (Q&A), it is of interest to explore whether there are differences in social Q&A usages between the two platforms. The purpose of this paper is to compare web and mobile platforms of a social Q&A service from the user's perspective in terms of three dimensions, namely, demographics, individual-based constructs, and information-based constructs.
Design/methodology/approach Because Zhihu.com is one of the most popular social Q&A sites in China, the authors used online questionnaires to investigate its users' perceptions of these three dimensions. From January to March 2016, the authors obtained 278 valid responses in total through snowball and convenient sampling. Collected data are analyzed through descriptive statistics and inferential statistics.
Findings The results indicate that there exist significant differences between web users and mobile users on Zhihu.com in terms of gender, affinity, and information seeking. More specifically, compared to the male users, more female users rely on the mobile platform to access the information service; mobile users perceive higher affinity with Zhihu.com than web users; and mobile users perceive higher information-seeking intention than web users do.
Originality/value Regarding the theoretical aspect, this study proposes a conceptual framework for comparison between the web and mobile platforms of social Q&A from the user's perspective. Regarding the practical aspect, the comparative results of this study could give social Q&A service providers useful information about users' differences between web and mobile platforms of social Q&A services.

AB  - The use of emoticons, particularly on smart mobile devices, has become increasingly popular among young people in recent years. The emoticon is not just a form of information transmission; it also represents a new way of life and a new trend among young people. The aim of this study was to understand the role of emoticons in the daily lives of Chinese young people, investigate how mediated communication has been improved by smart mobile devices and discover users' preferred types of emoticon. First, a review of the literature on emoticons was conducted to explore the relationship between the evolution of the emoticon and young people's everyday lives. Next, in-depth interviews were conducted, which yielded novel findings regarding emoticon use. Finally, a questionnaire was used to obtain data on emoticon use for statistical analysis. The findings revealed four key dimensions of emoticon use that were relevant to the research questions: accuracy, sociability, efficiency and enjoyment. These four dimensions help us to better understand the development of emoticons and their influence on the lifestyles of young people. The findings are expected to provide inspiration and suggest directions for improving the design of smart communication.

AB  - Reports an error in 'Multi-device use: Understanding the motivations behind switching between multiple devices during a task' by Chi-Wen Chen and Marios Koufaris (International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction, Advanced Online Publication, Feb 15, 2020, np). When the article above was first published, the affiliation of the second author was incorrectly stated as ‘Department of Information Systems, Zicklin School of Business, Baruch College, City University of New York, New York, USA’. The correct author’s affiliation is ‘Paul H. Chook Department of Information Systems and Statistics, Zicklin School of Business, Baruch College, City University of New York, New York, New York, USA’ (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2020-11809-001[/rid]). Multi-device use has become a popular pattern of device use in recent years. However, empirical studies pertaining to motivations behind intention to use multiple devices have been limited. The objective of this study focuses on answering an essential question: given that heterogeneous devices are available to users, why do users use multiple devices rather than a single device to complete a task? Both Task-Technology Fit Theory and mental workload paradigm are considered to develop eight hypotheses and build the research framework. A trip-planning scenario was designed and used in the questionnaire to understand the factors that motivate users to use multiple devices. A total of 217 subjects completed the questionnaire. The results show that perceived task fit with multi-device use forms users’ attitudes toward and expected satisfaction with multi-device use. Furthermore, users’ attitudes toward multi-device use trigger their intentions to use multiple devices. Additionally, perceived complexity of multi-device use hinders users from perceiving good task fit with multi-device use. Implications for theory, practice, and future research directions are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Automotive telematics comprises the applications of Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation, multimedia entertainment, wireless Communications and automatic driving assistance systems. This stud), examined users' acceptance of automotive telematics. Following the theory comparison approach, we evaluated including the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) and Combined Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)-TPB model (C-TAM-TPB), that could explain users' automotive telematics acceptance decisions. The respective models were evaluated using web-based survey data collected from 345 users about their perceptions of automotive telematics. Overall, the results revealed that the effect of Perceived Ease Of Use, Attitude and Perceived Behavioural Control were very important but that usefulness and Subjective Norm did not influence an individual's Behavioural Intention. The implications of this study were also discussed.

AB  - This exploratory research investigates factors affecting online and offline service quality with respect to a sharing economy driven car-hailing commerce. It further validates the relationships between service quality, satisfaction, and loyalty in the sharing economy driven business context. Building on relevant literature and 71 qualitative interviews, we identified information congruity, competence, and empathy as key factors in online service quality. Offline service quality factors include structural assurance and platform responsiveness. These five factors were included in a model for user loyalty investigation, which was tested on data from 294 questionnaires from Chinese mobile car-hailing service users. Attitudes towards the sharing economy were validated to moderate the relationship between service quality and loyalty. This study contributes to the theoretical development of service quality management, specifically in the context of emerging sharing economy driven car-hailing mobile markets.

AB  - Most existing research assumes “phone use during face-to-face interactions” to be psychosocially detrimental. Drawing on the digital social multitasking framework, this study explored not only the negative but also positive implications of the behavior. A sample of 517 adolescents (Mage = 14.83, S.D. = 1.93; 50% female) recruited through the Qualtrics panel completed an online survey. Results showed that adolescents’ and their friend’s digital social multitasking were both associated with (1) greater perceived efficiency, which, in turn, was associated with competence need satisfaction, and (2) greater perceived connection, which, in turn, was associated with better friendship quality, autonomy need satisfaction, and relatedness need satisfaction. Adolescents’ own multitasking also had an indirect, negative relationship with friendship quality through perceived distraction, but friend’s multitasking did not compromise friendship quality. The study provides a more balanced picture, showing that despite the potential harm of digital social multitasking, adolescents’ phone use during face-to-face peer interactions also involves potential benefits for teens’ psychosocial well-being.

AB  - This research contributes to the debate about the relevance of Industry 4.0 technologies in improving environmental performance in the manufacturing industry. We employed a qualitative-quantitative approach in which 19 Italian operations managers were interviewed and 260 managers responded to an online questionnaire. The effects of various technologies were ranked using ordinal regression. Comments and suggestions gave context to the quantitative results. Sensors, radio-frequency identification, artificial intelligence and analytics were found to be most relevant in improving environmental performance, whereas simulation software contributed moderately. Additive manufacturing, cobots, robots, automated mobile robots and automated guided vehicles had a negative effect, augmented reality had no effect and other technologies indirectly affected environmental performance. We also found a lack of knowledge and application as well as scepticism about technologies such as artificial intelligence and augmented reality. Finally, there was concern about the disposal of electrical and electronic waste produced by these technologies.

AB  - ObjectiveTo identify the current clinical practices of Medicare-certified facilities offering ventricular assist devices as destination therapy and to attain a consensus of recommended clinical practices across the United States for the management of adults with ventricular assist devices as destination therapy.MethodSixty ventricular assist device coordinators from Medicare-certified centers were invited to participate in an online, 2-round Delphi survey. The surveys asked whether recommended practices are current practices and whether respondents always/agreed or never/disagreed with performing the recommended practice guidelines. Consensus was defined as 75% agreement. The clinical areas of focus were patient selection, preoperative preparation, postoperative care, infection control, nutrition, and patient discharge preparation. Practices were extracted from the advanced practice guidelines for HeartMate destination therapy and the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation's 2006 guidelines for the care of heart transplant candidates.ResultsRepresenting 21 states across the country, the first-round survey had a response rate of 57% (n = 34). The second-round survey had a response rate of 74% (n= 17), representing 28% of the 60 centers. Consensus was obtained for 122 practices. The dimension of patient selection?diagnostic tests and screening had the highest level of consensus (16%, n = 20), and the dimension of postoperative care?intermediate/intensive care unit dimension had the lowest level of consensus (3.3%, n = 4).ConclusionSurvey results identify a consensus of practices for the specific group of ventricular assist device coordinators who responded, but that consensus cannot be generalized to all ventricular assist device facilities. These results can, however, provide a foundation for further research leading to the development of standard-of-care practices for patients with ventricular assist devices as destination therapy.

AB  - Recently, interactive approaches aimed at helping people practice mindfulness have appeared in the literature. However, the few available user studies for such approaches focus only on short-term effects and are carried out in a lab or in a similar artificial setting. In this study, we aim instead at assessing the effectiveness of a mobile mindfulness app when used by people in their everyday contexts and over a prolonged period of time. People could participate in the study by downloading the app from Apple's App Store as well as Google Play and by answering a mindfulness questionnaire at three pre-set times over a 4-week period. Moreover, the app automatically collected usage data each time it was used and qualitative feedback at the end of the study. Results reveal that users with no or minimal experience with meditation significantly increased their level of mindfulness over the 4-week study period. Moreover, the qualitative feedback provided by participants indicates that the app was positively perceived as beautiful and its usage elicited positive feelings in most of them. We discuss possible factors that could have contributed to the obtained results. Finally, we analyze how many users abandoned the study and at what times, comparing such data with other studies based on app stores distribution, and giving possible reasons. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objective: Representing nursing data sets in a standard way will help to facilitate sharing relevant information across settings. We aimed to populate nursing process and outcome metrics with electronic health record (EHR) data and then compare the results with event reporting systems. Methods: We used the "eMeasure" development process of the National Quality Forum adopted by the American Nurses Association. We used operational definitions of quality measures from the American Nurses Association and the US Institute for Healthcare Improvement and employed concept mapping of local data elements to 2 controlled vocabularies to define a standard data dictionary: (1) Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes and (2) International Classification for Nursing Practice. We assessed feasibility using the nursing data set of 7829 and 8199 patients from 2 general hospitals with different EHR systems. Using inpatient falls as a use case, we compared the populated measures with results from the event reporting systems. Results: We identified 17 care components and 118 unique concepts and matched them with data elements in the EHRs. Including suboptimal mapping, 98% of the assessment concepts mapped to Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes and 52.9% of intervention concepts mapped to International Classification for Nursing Practice. While not all process indicators were available from event reporting systems, we successfully populated 9 fall prevention process indicators and the fall rate outcome indicator from the 2 EHRs. We were unable to populate the falls with an injury rate indicator. Conclusions: EHR data can populate fall prevention process measure metrics and at least one inpatient fall prevention outcome metric.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced social inequality in marginalized groups. People with disabilities (PWD) are particularly restricted in their activities and lives due to the pandemic and experiencing more difficulties than the general population. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the extent of the digital divide between PWD and people without disabilities (PWOD) during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea. METHODS: This study relied on the cross-sectional secondary data from the 2020 Digital Divide Survey conducted in Korea. We performed a series of bivariate analyses on the data of 5575 PWOD and 1781 PWD (18–69 years old) to compare Internet usage and various types of digital services related to the pandemic. RESULTS: We identified significant differences between PWOD and PWD in their Internet usage change during the pandemic. A higher number of PWD reported that their Internet usage with both computers and mobile devices remained similar to the pre-pandemic period while that of PWOD reported that their Internet usage via the same has increased. Significant gaps were found in the usage change of the five digital services with the largest gap in that of social networking services between PWOD and PWD. Further, PWOD were likelier to be aware of, utilize, and perceive the usefulness of digital services during the COVID-19 pandemic including application, information, delivery, and subscription services. CONCLUSION: To ensure better post-pandemic outcomes for marginalized groups including PWD, the governments and authority agencies must facilitate digital access and services with appropriate accommodations needed by those populations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There has been a continuous increase of smart device use among people with physical disabilities in Korea. In spite of previous research on those people’s motives to adopt smart devices, little investigation has been conducted to scrutinize post-adoption behaviors of using smart devices among people with physical disabilities. OBJECTIVE: /Hypothesis: Based on the post-adoption model, this study examined the relationship between post-adoption beliefs regarding smart devices and behavioral intentions toward continued use of smartphones among people with physical disabilities. Moreover, this study investigated the moderating effects of self-efficacy on the relationships among the main study variables. METHODS: Both online and paper-pencil surveys were conducted, resulting in a total of 108 questionnaires collected from people with physical disabilities. RESULTS: A path analysis showed that, with the exception of perceived ease of use, all variables (confirmation, perceived usefulness, and satisfaction of smart device use) had significant effects on continuance intention to use smart devices. Another main finding of this study was the significant moderating effects of general self-efficacy on the relationships among the three variables of confirmation, perceived usefulness, and continuance intention of smart devices. The relationships among the three variables were significantly stronger among people with lower levels of general self-efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: This study’s main findings will aid the thorough comprehension of the mechanisms that lead people with physical disabilities to continue to use smart devices.

AB  - Although research interest in post adoption behavior of ICT (Information and Communication Technology)users increases from year to year, few studies examine how motivational factors and service type influence post adoption behavior. This study investigates the antecedents of post adoption behavior in the Mobile Data Services (MDS) domain. The study conducted a nationwide online survey in Korea to verify the proposed research model that includes motivational factors and service type. Two extrinsic motivation factors (post usefulness and post monetary value) and two intrinsic motivation factors (post ease of use and post enjoyment) are the main components of the motivational factors. The results of the study reveal that the motivational factors and service type influence the post adopter type in the MDS context. The findings of this study help provide guidelines for MDS providers to select a target market and to devise a strategy that meets the stated objectives of the selected market.

AB  - The market for food delivery mobile applications (FDMAs) in South Korea has massively expanded due to the increase in both smartphone penetration rate and single-person households, thus marking a phase of severe competition. A deeper understanding among FDMA practitioners of users' acceptance of FDMAs is required to become more competitive. The technology acceptance model (TAM) is a dominant theory to help illuminate users' acceptance of new technology. However, users' familiarity (FAM) and satisfaction (SAT) with new technology has been less studied in the context of FDMA. Based on this background, this study aims to examine the relationships between users' FAM, perceived ease of use (PEU), perceived usefulness (PU), SAT, and intention to reuse (IR) in the context of FDMAs. With the use of an online-based questionnaire, data were obtained from consumers who have experienced with one of the top-three mobile apps for food delivery in South Korea. Partial least squares structural equation modeling is employed to examine the extended TAM in the Korean FDMA setting. The findings demonstrate that (a) FAM has a positive influence on both PEU and PU; (b) PEU is positively associated with PU; (c) both FAM and PU positively affect SAT, but PEU does not; and (d) FAM, PU, and SAT are the significant antecedents of IR. This study then discusses the findings in terms of academic contributions and suggests practical implications, focusing on marketing strategies that can be usefully adopted by FDMA developers.

AB  - Aims and objectives: To report the informatics competencies of students in selected undergraduate and graduate nursing programmes, to examine whether informatics competencies differed between the different programmes and to suggest competency- based applications that will strengthen informatics courses and informatics-related content throughout the curricula. Background: Nursing students in undergraduate and graduate nursing programmes have different educational backgrounds and different practice experience. Thus, their informatics preparation is apt to be varied, and nursing curricula must reflect this variation while advancing students towards informatics proficiency. However, studies on informatics competency assessment in these nursing students are scarce. Design: A descriptive survey design. Methods: Data were collected from 289 nursing students using a 30-item Self-Assessment of Nursing Informatics Competencies Scale via an email sent to students using a LISTSERV mailing list. The email embedded link to the Internet survey package, SurveyMonkey, which included the Self-Assessment of Nursing Informatics Competencies Scale and demographic questions along with an online consent form. Results: Students in both programmes were competent in three subscale areas: basic computer knowledge and skills, clinical informatics attitude, and wireless device skills. Graduate students reported slightly higher mean competency scores than did undergraduate students in three subscales: clinical informatics role, clinical informatics attitude and wireless device skills. Conclusions: Findings indicate specific topics for nurse educators to consider when designing informatics curricula. The comparison of undergraduate and graduate students indicates similarities in informatics competencies in terms of areas where students were competent and small mean score differences. Further studies are suggested to examine whether there are differences in informatics competencies between undergraduate and graduate students. Relevance to clinical practice: These results assist nurse educators in determining specific areas of informatics content that need greater focus and inclusion in the design of better nursing educational programmes. Examples of integrating competencies into existing curriculum or informatics courses are suggested. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Instant messaging is a popular form of text-based communication. However, text-based messaging lacks the ability to communicate nonverbal information such as that conveyed through facial expressions and voice tones, although a multitude of emotions may underlie the text of a conversation between participants. In this paper, we propose an approach that uses typefaces to communicate emotions. We investigated which typefaces are useful for delivering emotions and introduced these typefaces into a mobile chat app. We conducted a survey to demonstrate how changes in the typeface of a message affected the meaning of the message conveyed. Our user study provides an understanding of the actual user experience with the application. The results show that the use of multiple typefaces in a message can affect and intensify the valence received by users and the use of multiple typefaces elicited an active response and brought about a livelier mood during texting.

AB  - The present study sheds light on the nature of the multi-dimensional aspects of news consumption by focusing on three different news-related activities on online social networking services (SNSs): news reading, news posting, and news endorsing. Borrowing from the literature on uses and gratifications theory, as well as media attendance theory and the concept of a technology cluster, the study investigated why people consume news differently on SNSs. The results show that each type of news activity may derive from different kinds of motivations, media habits and technology clusters. For example, the motivation of 'getting recognition' was found to be an important driving force for news posting, while it was not a significant predictor of news reading and news endorsing. On the other hand, the 'entertainment' motivation was revealed to be positively associated with news reading and news endorsing, while it was not with news posting. In addition, those who have an internet-based news repertoire were more likely to participate in news activities on SNSs and those who have many mobile devices were found to participate in news reading more frequently. The study was conducted using a national online survey. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Purpose This paper attempts to identify key factors (i.e., personalization, privacy awareness and social norms) that affect user experiences (UXs) of mobile recommendation systems according to the user involvement theory (push-based and pull-based) and their relationships. Design/methodology/approach The study is based on an online survey with students from an international business school located in southwestern China. The sample population for the study included randomly selected 600 university students who are active mobile phone users. A total of 470 questionnaires were returned; 456 were valid (14 were invalid due to the incompleteness of their responses), providing a response rate of 65%. Findings Social norms have the largest impact on user experience quality, followed by personalization and privacy awareness. User involvement in mobile recommendation systems has mediating effects on the above relationships, with larger effects on pull-based systems than on push-based systems. Originality/value This study provides an integrated framework for researchers to measure the effects of social, personal and risk factors on the quality of user experience. The results enrich the literature on user involvement, mobile recommendation systems and UX. The findings provide significant implications for both retailers and developers of mobile recommendation systems.

AB  - With the growing popularity of smartphones and tablets, the number of people who use wireless internet, including mobile internet, reached 11 million in 2013. The number of m-commerce services and applications used by customers in Taiwan is still small. This study aims to investigate the factors that predict users' behavioural intention to adopt m-commerce in Taiwan. It is based on the revised Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology model (UTAUT), and two of Hofstede's cultural dimensions (power distance and uncertainty avoidance) as moderators on the UTAUT model to enhance the understanding of influencing users' intention of using m-commerce. The study sample surveyed with online questionnaires consists of 435 valid respondents. The research result shows that effort expectation, performance expectation, social influence and trust significantly influence the behavioural intention to use m-commerce. For moderator effects, power distance has an interacting effect with social influence, and has a negative relationship with social influence on behavioural intention to use m-commerce.

AB  - This paper developed and evaluated a Lilliput Multimedia (LM) system to enhance students' learning motivation by bringing them personally onto the scene to explore the world without having to leave the classroom. The LM system integrates of digital multimedia exhibition content, remote-controlled toy cars, and toy models of the buildings to motivate the students and engage them to learn as if they were touring a Lilliputian museum. With the help of the LM system, students are able to enjoy touring experiences from within the classroom without having to physically walk through them. In the current study, the theme of "world-famous buildings" was selected as the learning topic to illustrate how the LM system can be used to assist students' learning. The potential of the LM system was evaluated. The participants were 30 fifth-grade elementary-school students. Questionnaires, interviews and video records were utilized to study the students' acceptance of using the LM system and to assess students' attitude towards learning about world-famous buildings. The findings show that the students responded very positively to learning using this multimedia learning system.

AB  - Governments around the globe are striving to provide e-government, online products and services to all the citizens of their respective countries. This has meant that there is a shift in the conventional mode of public service delivery from a face-to-face and telephone mode to electronic means. However, not all the citizens are making use of these changes, and the one demographic group that is currently attracting immense interest related to their welfare, health and other such issues is the older age group. Using this as a reason, the aim of this exploratory and explanatory research was to understand the e-government initiatives in the UK, more specifically in London. To conduct this research, a mixed qualitative and quantitative research approach was pursued. It was concluded that the benefits of the Internet to many of the users is relative, depending on the age, perceptions and level of innovativeness of the user. It was learnt that in relation to quality, the local authority websites do contain useful and relevant information for the elderly. However, this information is difficult to access, mainly due to the lack of knowledge, skills in the use of computers or Internet. From this research, it is expected that a contribution to academia will emerge in the form of a better understanding of issues related to e-government, the digital divide and older citizens. For industry, the contributions of this research are the identification and understanding of issues related to online products and services and the older citizen. For policy-makers, this research proffers an understanding of issues related with demand and supply of online products and services that governments are currently providing. © The Author 2013.

AB  - This dissertation explores the question: how are touch-based devices intended to alter epochal discourses on subjective constitution and how is mimesis deployed in this pursuit? Touch-based devices are critically analyzed as being purposively aimed at affecting subjective constitution through processes of mimesis, focusing on regimes of representation and sensorial organization. Research proceeds through a history of ideas, and a two-part content analysis of touch-based devices currently in research, and public and personal use touch-based devices currently available on the market. Using formal publications by the producers of said technologies, methodologies of the sociology and history of technology are implemented to draw out an analytical schema connecting produced technological artifacts to the theoretical research on subjectivity, control, and sensorial experience. In using the term "mimesis," a lineage is traced from the classical use through the Frankfurt School analysis of Walter Benjamin and Siegfried Kracauer, to what is termed "epimimesis," or a mimesis-like quality that negates the very possibility of an original while utilizing the full corporeality of the human in epimimetic experience. Touch-based devices are examined as a fulcrum of a shift from a visual ontology to a more corporeal ontology, resulting in technological experience that deploys a mimesis-like process through a greater involvement of the entire self. Such explorations of present technological practices are conducted in the vein of Merleau-Ponty's call to reexamine our habitual backgrounds, casting a critical eye on touch-based devices as highly proliferated artifacts of the mediascape. It is found that, in the process of designing touch-based devices, producers come to imagine an "implied user" and script this into the device itself, thereby naturalizing certain ideations of the human, human nature and human ability. The language of touch and gesture is codified by device producers, ossifying a certain discourse of human ability. Actual users must then adapt to this implied user in order to properly utilize the device, thereby creating "altered users." This is of particular interest to touch-based devices, as they are often posited by producers as "natural" and "intuitive." The political implications of such reifications and scripting of discourse is explored. Copies of dissertations may be obtained by addressing your request to ProQuest, 789 E. Eisenhower Parkway, P.O.

AB  - Mobile learning readiness is a new aspect of technology integration for classroom teachers. Determining the best strategies for successfully implementing mobile devices in order to improve learning is an important topic needing systematic research, because targeted professional development can help ensure effective integration of mobile learning into classroom environments. Teachers must have supportive professional development fostering enthusiasm and willingness as well as skill in techniques for integrating mobile devices successfully in the classroom. In this study the Mobile Learning Readiness Survey (MLRS) scales are confirmed to be aligned with well-established measures of technology integration based on more traditional information technologies. Educators who are higher in technology integration report the greatest benefits from mobile learning, prefer online or blended learning and recognize the importance of external influences on implementation. The four scales of the MLRS generally exhibit the desirable properties of step-wise increases in readiness as teacher competence grows and include a basis for beginning the development of a classification framework to assist in targeting types of professional development.

AB  - We present two empirical studies of visual search in dynamic 3D visualisations of large, randomly ordered, photo collections. The aim is to assess the possible effects of geometrical distortions on visual search effectiveness, efficiency and comfort, by comparing the influence of two perspective representations of photo collections on participants' performance results and subjective judgments. Thumbnails of the 1000 or so photographs in each collection are plastered on the lateral surface of a vertical cylinder, either on the inside (inner view, IV) or on the outside (outer view, OV). IV and OV suggest two different interaction metaphors: locomotion in a virtual space (IV) versus manipulation of a virtual object (OV). They also implement different perspective distortions: enlargement and distortion of lateral columns (IV) versus enlargement of central columns and dwindling plus distortion of lateral columns (OV). Presentation of results focus on the second study, S2, which involved 20 participants and offered them strictly identical interaction facilities with the two views, unlike the initial pilot study, S1 (8 participants and slightly different interaction facilities between the two views). Participants in both studies were experienced computer users (average age: 25.15 years, SD: 3.13). They performed two types of basic visual tasks that are carried out repeatedly while navigating photo collections: (i) searching for a photo meeting specific, visual and thematic, criteria, the photo and its location in the collection being unknown to participants (ST1) and (ii) looking for a visually familiar photo, the location of the photo being familiar to participants (ST2). According to post-experiment questionnaires and debriefings, all participants in S2 save one judged both 3D views positively in reference to standard 2D visualisations. Half of them preferred IV over OV, four appreciated OV better, and six expressed no clear opinion. Preferences were mainly motivated by the effects of perspective distortions on thumbnail visibility. They were barely influenced by interaction metaphors (e.g., the feeling of immersion induced by IV). Despite large inter-individual differences in performance, a majority of participants carried out ST1 tasks more effectively and efficiently with IV than with OV, as regards error rates (statistically significant difference) and search times (tendency). Performance results for ST2 tasks were similar with the two views, due, probably, to the simplicity and brevity of ST2 tasks. Perspective distortions seem to have exerted less influence on participants' visual strategies than horizontal scrolling, a dynamic feature common to both views. Qualitative analyses of participants' behaviours suggest that IV has the potential to support spatial memory better than OV, presumably thanks to the locomotion metaphor. These results indicate that perspective views have the potential to facilitate and improve visual search in unstructured picture collections provided that distortions are adapted to users' individual visual capabilities. Further research is needed to better understand: (i) the actual relations between visual exploration strategies and geometrical properties of perspective visualisations and (ii) the influence of the manipulation and locomotion metaphors on spatial memory. This knowledge is necessary to further improve the comfort and effectiveness of visual search in large unstructured picture collections, using 3D visualisations. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - With the increasing importance of online information environments, researchers have started investigating direct measures of online media use, such as online tracking. Most existing studies using tracking data have so far relied on commercial solutions, but these have limitations in terms of their costliness, replicability, and applicability to certain research questions. Hence, different research groups are developing their own tracking solutions for academic purposes. In this paper, we provide a critical review and classification of the existing approaches, apt to guide research decisions on the appropriate tracking approach and tool. First, we develop criteria to distinguish different user-centric desktop and mobile tracking approaches and tools (types of information, technical complexity, privacy implementation, user experience, and availability). Second, we describe different tools and approaches - separately for desktop and mobile tracking - with concrete examples and evaluate them using the aforementioned criteria. Finally, we discuss how different mobile and desktop tracking solutions can complement each other and provide recommendations for future research.

AB  - This chapter provides a number of different strategies that faculty might use to leverage mobile devices within their courses. It explores the question of why we might consider taking a 'mobile-first' mentality when designing courses. A strategy that can be rather easily incorporated into the face-to-face classroom is the use the mobile devices as a way of delivering an advanced organizer. Many faculty utilize their campus learning management system (LMS) for face-to-face or online courses and most LMS have a mobile version. Arguably, one of the most important elements of any course is effective and efficient interaction between the instructor and student both in and out of the classroom. Another consideration of mobile-first design in the classroom is using alternative communication platforms to interact and communicate electronically with students. A fully mobile course would likely contain materials that are inherently interactive and adaptive to individual learners and where classroom activities can be easily completed on one's smartphone.

AB  - The advancement of wireless and mobile technologies has enabled students to learn in an environment that combines learning resources from both the real world and the digital world. Although such an approach has been recognized as being innovative and important, several problems have been revealed in practical learning activities. One major problem is owing to the lack of proper learning strategies or tools for assisting the students to acquire knowledge in such a complex learning scenario. Students might feel excited or engaged when using the mobile devices to learn in the real context; nevertheless, their learning achievements could be disappointing. To deal with this problem, this study presents a mobile learning system that employs Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to detect and examine real-world learning behaviors of students. This study also utilizes each student’s responses from a two-tier test (i.e., multiple-choice questions in a two-level format) to provide personalized learning guidance (called two-tier test guiding, T³G). The experimental results from a natural science course of an elementary school show that this innovative approach is able to improve the learning achievements of students as well as enhance their learning motivation.

AB  - Owing to the advancement of mobile and wireless communication technologies, an increasing number of mobile learning studies have been conducted in recent years. In a mobile learning environment, students are able to learn indoors and outdoors with access to online resources at any time. However, whether or not new learning scenarios that combine both real-world contexts and digital-world resources are beneficial to the students has been questioned. Moreover, it is also interesting to probe whether the existing e-learning strategies are effective when situated in those mobile learning scenarios. In this study, an in-field activity on an indigenous culture course of an elementary school with a formative assessment-based learning strategy was conducted to investigate the possible negative effects of mobile learning by analyzing the students’ cognitive load and learning achievement. It is interesting to find that, without proper treatment, the performance of students using those existing online learning strategies, known to be 'effective,' might be disappointing or may even negatively affect the students’ learning achievements. Furthermore, the negative effects could be due to the heavy cognitive load caused by an improper learning design. Such findings offer good references for those who intend to design and conduct mobile learning activities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Yehliu Geopark mGuiding is an Android application that can perform several tasks related to guiding tourists. The improvement of the application is based on a user evaluation of the former version of the Yehliu Geopark tour guiding system which was designed to be executed on a personal digital assistant device. The user evaluation data were acquired from a questionnaire survey comprising a sample of 101 respondents and were processed using ridits analysis and importance-performance analysis. Results revealed the tourists' preferences for the tour guiding system. The application was redesigned based on the tourists' preferences. The new features of the application include: (1) a Geopark map that is attractive and easy to read; (2) augmented reality (AR) with camera and global positioning system (GPS) functions; (3) user-friendly guiding interface of scenic spots. The application integrates tracking and location functions using GPS coordinates, multi-media guiding (descriptions of scenic spots, videos, photographs and audio presentations), suggested tour selection and searching using AR. The Yehliu Geopark mGuiding system offers a user-friendly interface that the tourists can use on their own smartphone for a complete tour.

AB  - The way users interact with computer input devices is a trending subject of research in the field of security as it is another source of biometric data for authentication. This article focuses on computer mouse as a common tool for browsing the web and its characteristics of use. The article provides a comprehensive study of related research papers and compares approaches to the preprocessing stage of biometric authentication which is a potential target for improvement. The article further proposes a framework to assess the quality of features with respect to the theory of biometrics. Using this framework, a comprehensive set of features across the works is compared on datasets acquired from two controlled experiments simulating both static and continuous authentication. The article shows that selection of features based on the proposed assessment has a positive impact on user authentication results.

AB  - Smart speakers have the potential to support independent living and wellness among low-income senior housing (LISH) residents. The aim of this study was to examine and compare LISH residents? attitudes and perceptions toward smart speakers at two time points: before and after technology use (N?=?47). A descriptive survey was administered to ask questions about hedonic motivation, perceived ease of use, self-efficacy, perceived usefulness of some potential or existing smart speaker features, cost, and privacy. Participants were initially favorable toward using a smart speaker and its digital agent (e.g., Alexa) as a daily assistant and wellness tool. They especially liked the smart speaker?s potential functionality of detecting harmful events and notifying someone to receive immediate help. The comparison of pre- and post-use responses revealed non-significant declines in most items, with the exception of willingness to use Alexa as a reminder system (p?

AB  - It is very challenging for children with autism to express their emotions to others as well as to recognise others' feelings accurately. As social difficulties of autistic people might aggravate their loneliness and social isolation, a holistic development is required from an early age. This study aimed to suggest a digital intervention for supporting autistic children's empathy development by using design thinking. This study developed a mobile-interface design on the basis of the human-centred design approach, and a prototype was evaluated by stakeholders with respect to acceptability and usability. Usability was measured by twelve statements of a combination of design guidelines and the system usability scale, and subsequently, open-end interview questions were offered to collect data regarding acceptability. The separate interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim, and thus, meaningful data were selected and clustered by themes. The result of the qualitative data analysis is represented by eighteen themes in five categories. Altogether, this research suggests a phased (bit-by-bit) strategy for teaching empathy of children with ASD through a digital intervention.

AB  - The main purpose of this study is to explore theoretically and empirically the effects of consumers' different surfing behaviors in terms of advertising effectiveness in the new media context. This study attempts to answer two primary questions: (1) What effect does interactivity have on attitude and memory? (2) What is the role of individual motivation on clicking behavior on the Web site? In this study, perceived interactivity was also found to influence consumers' attitudes toward the ad and memory for its contents. This finding is consistent with literature about the effects of interaction on attitude and memory. Results of this study showed a positive impact of perceived interactivity on both attitude and memory. © 2004 Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the effects that reading on screens (using digital devices with different screen sizes) and on paper have on reading time and comprehension. The study group was comprised of126 secondary students from a private school. To ensure balance, the participants were assigned into test groups, formed according to the size of the reading device, based on class levels, gender, and average school grade. In the data collection process, a narrative text was transferred to both print and electronic media. Access to the text was provided on paper and three digital devices. There were no time limitations. After reading, participants were given comprehension tests that consisted of twenty multiple-choice questions. Female participants' on-screen comprehension scores were found to be relatively higher compared to their paper comprehension scores. They also acquired better scores as the screen size increased. Conversely, male participants had higher comprehension scores on tablets and smart phones. Participants who read the text on smart phones and tablets completed the tasks in less time compared to other groups. However, the effects of reading modality on comprehension and reading time were not found to be statistically significant in either the male or female groups.

AB  - The recent appearance of low cost virtual reality (VR) technologies – like the Oculus Rift, the HTC Vive and the Sony PlayStation VR – and Mixed Reality Interfaces (MRITF) – like the Hololens – is attracting the attention of users and researchers suggesting it may be the next largest stepping stone in technological innovation. However, the history of VR technology is longer than it may seem: the concept of VR was formulated in the 1960s and the first commercial VR tools appeared in the late 1980s. For this reason, during the last 20 years, 100s of researchers explored the processes, effects, and applications of this technology producing 1000s of scientific papers. What is the outcome of this significant research work? This paper wants to provide an answer to this question by exploring, using advanced scientometric techniques, the existing research corpus in the field. We collected all the existent articles about VR in the Web of Science Core Collection scientific database, and the resultant dataset contained 21,667 records for VR and 9,944 for augmented reality (AR). The bibliographic record contained various fields, such as author, title, abstract, country, and all the references (needed for the citation analysis). The network and cluster analysis of the literature showed a composite panorama characterized by changes and evolutions over the time. Indeed, whether until 5 years ago, the main publication media on VR concerned both conference proceeding and journals, more recently journals constitute the main medium of communication. Similarly, if at first computer science was the leading research field, nowadays clinical areas have increased, as well as the number of countries involved in VR research. The present work discusses the evolution and changes over the time of the use of VR in the main areas of application with an emphasis on the future expected VR’s capacities, increases and challenges. We conclude considering the disruptive contribution that VR/AR/MRITF will be able to get in scientific fields, as well in human communication and interaction, as already happened with the advent of mobile phones by increasing the use and the development of scientific applications (e.g., in clinical areas) and by modifying the social communication and interaction among people.

AB  - Speech interfaces are growing in popularity. Through a review of 99 research papers this work maps the trends, themes, findings and methods of empirical research on speech interfaces in the field of human-computer interaction (HCI). We find that studies are usability/theory-focused or explore wider system experiences, evaluating Wizard of Oz, prototypes or developed systems. Measuring task and interaction was common, as was using self-report questionnaires to measure concepts like usability and user attitudes. A thematic analysis of the research found that speech HCI work focuses on nine key topics: system speech production, design insight, modality comparison, experiences with interactive voice response systems, assistive technology and accessibility, user speech production, using speech technology for development, peoples' experiences with intelligent personal assistants and how user memory affects speech interface interaction. From these insights we identify gaps and challenges in speech research, notably taking into account technological advancements, the need to develop theories of speech interface interaction, grow critical mass in this domain, increase design work and expand research from single to multiple user interaction contexts so as to reflect current use contexts. We also highlight the need to improve measure reliability, validity and consistency, in the wild deployment and reduce barriers to building fully functional speech interfaces for research. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS: Most papers focused on usability/theory-based or wider system experience research with a focus on Wizard of Oz and developed systems Questionnaires on usability and user attitudes often used but few were reliable or validated Thematic analysis showed nine primary research topics Challenges identified in theoretical approaches and design guidelines, engaging with technological advances, multiple user and in the wild contexts, critical research mass and barriers to building speech interfaces

AB  - This paper studies the similarities and differences among the views of school principals and teachers regarding a mobile computer lab (MCL) initiative implemented in 1,591 public schools in Chile. It also characterizes the aspects in which their views diverge. A mixed methods study was carried out in two stages: first, a quantitative stage, where a self-administered (web-based) questionnaire was sent to the schools; and second, a qualitative stage, where a case study was conducted with three schools. The results show a greater convergence of the teachers’ and school principals’ views regarding the contribution of ICT resources to teaching, with more divergence when it comes to the implementation process. More specifically, these differences were related to two points: (1) how appropriate the conditions were for using and learning how to use the new resources within the context of the school, and (2) who should be held accountable for integrating ICT resources within the school organization. Furthermore, the qualitative results revealed that school principals only had vague information on the pedagogical integration of the MCLs in their schools. These findings suggest that in order to have more effective technology integration processes in schools, a closer presence of school leaders in the teachers’ everyday pedagogical activities is required.

AB  - There has been increasing interest in informal learning in recent years alongside interest in how such learning can be supported by technology. However, relatively little is known about the extent to which adults make use of their own mobile devices to support informal learning. In this study, a survey was used to investigate whether, and to what extent, experienced users of mobile devices use their mobile devices to support intentional informal learning. If so, do they make use of mobile device connectivity to support opportunistic informal learning and does such connectivity support or encourage collaborative informal learning? Experienced mobile device users were recruited from web forums and business, and asked whether they used their devices to support informal learning. A pattern of learning uses emerged, some of which deployed the mobile device capabilities relatively unchanged, others triggered adaptations to typical learning activities to provide a better fit to the needs of the learner. These informal learning activities provided the basis for the design of a flexible mobile learning framework that can be extended to support developments in mobile technology, and increasing use of Web 2.0 technologies by informal learners.

AB  - New opportunities have recently emerged in survey practice, coupled with a need to make changes, and alternative survey data collection modes such as those based on new technologies (for example, the Web and mobile phones) have become a focus of interest. Studies have considered the biases due to data collection modes and to the wording of questions in questionnaires, but they have rarely dealt with the interaction between the two phenomena. This paper presents the results of a study on the interactions between some of the best-known question-wording effects and three data collection modes: face-to-face, Web-based and SMS-based (Short Text Messaging). The results have highlighted some interesting characteristics of the various modes—innovative ones in particular—and have confirmed the existence of potential interactions between data collection modes and question-wording effects. The findings may have significant implications for the study and practice of surveys and entail that, when surveys are designed, account is taken of specific factors associated with the method used to word the questions in questionnaires.

AB  - Text elision is a user interface technique that aims to improve the efficiency of navigating through information by allowing regions of text to be 'folded' into and out of the display. Several researchers have argued that elision interfaces are particularly suited to source code editing because they allow programmers to focus on relevant code regions while suppressing the display of irrelevant information. Elision features are now appearing in commercial systems for software development. There is, however, a lack of empirical evidence of the technique's efficiency. This paper presents an empirical evaluation of source code elision using a Java program editor. The evaluation compared a normal 'flat text' editor with two versions that diminished elided text to levels that were 'just legible' and 'illegible'. Performance was recorded in four tasks involving navigation through programs. Results show that programmers were able to complete their tasks more rapidly when using the elision interfaces, particularly in larger program files. Although several participants indicated a preference for the just legible elision interface, performance was best with illegible elision. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - We compare Internet and telephone survey responses across 27 European Union nations and two research contexts: one, a choice experiment of willingness to pay to avoid power outages, and the other, a public acceptance of energy infrastructure question. The various forms of survey mode effects and the challenges of survey mode choice are documented and developed in the context of statistical theory and an application to an economics survey. We find evidence that survey mode effects vary across research contexts, and to a lesser extent, across nations. We suggest that the degree of measurement bias may be varying between research contexts, for example based on the availability of a perceived socially correct response within a given context. Future survey-based research should evaluate the choice of survey mode in a context- and region-specific manner.

AB  - Adjudicated youth in residential treatment facilities (RTFs) have high rates of trauma exposure and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study evaluated strategies for implementing trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) in RTF. Therapists (N = 129) treating adjudicated youth were randomized by RTF program (N = 18) to receive one of the two TF-CBT implementation strategies: (1) web-based TF-CBT training + consultation (W) or (2) W + 2 day live TF-CBT workshop + twice monthly phone consultation (W + L). Youth trauma screening and PTSD symptoms were assessed via online dashboard data entry using the University of California at Los Angeles PTSD Reaction Index. Youth depressive symptoms were assessed with the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire–Short Version. Outcomes were therapist screening; TF-CBT engagement, completion, and fidelity; and youth improvement in PTSD and depressive symptoms. The W + L condition resulted in significantly more therapists conducting trauma screening (p = .0005), completing treatment (p = .03), and completing TF-CBT with fidelity (p = .001) than the W condition. Therapist licensure significantly impacted several outcomes. Adjudicated RTF youth receiving TF-CBT across conditions experienced statistically and clinically significant improvement in PTSD (p = .001) and depressive (p = .018) symptoms. W + L is generally superior to W for implementing TF-CBT in RTF. TF-CBT is effective for improving trauma-related symptoms in adjudicated RTF youth. Implementation barriers are discussed.

AB  - This article aims to clarify how epistemic communities dynamically shape the process of knowledge creation in a localized context and how the evolving interaction between different members of these communities enables knowledge to transit from its locus of emergence to the global market. It is argued that these dynamics rest on a series of clashes between different frames of reference, which enables bits of knowledge to be progressively revealed, enhanced, nurtured, interpreted and enacted collectively. © The Author (2014).

AB  - ObjectivesWe aimed to describe the bedside registered nurses perceived competence, attitudes, and challenges surrounding the management of patients with left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) in the intensive care unit (ICU) and stepdown unit (SDU).Research methodology/designAn exploratory research was employed using a survey.SettingBedside participants were recruited via an electronic recruitment flyer circulated in online professional and social networking sites.Main outcome measuresItems consisted of a numeric rating scale, measuring competence and attitudes related to the management of patients with left ventricular assist devices. The one open-ended question asked the participants to write responses regarding challenges in left ventricular assist device care. Data were analysed using quantitative and qualitative analytics software.ResultsA total of 36 intensive care unit and 35 stepdown unit bedside nurse (n = 71) from six regions of the United States responded. Overall mean scores for competency and attitude domains were ≥ 7.0. Intensive care nurses scored higher in competence and attitude when compared to stepdown unit nurses care of short-term left ventricular assist devices. Competence and attitude were positively associated with years of experience. Five themes related to challenges in care were identified.ConclusionOverall, bedside nurses had satisfactory competence and attitudes surrounding the care of hospitalised left ventricular assist device patients.

AB  - Background:Tobacco smoking is a significant source of morbidity in patients with a durable left ventricular assist device. While various cessation strategies have been investigated, the ability of ventricular assist device centers to implement a successful tobacco cessation program remains uncertain. We explored various cessation strategies employed by ventricular assist device centers and assessed perspectives of their effectiveness, as well as institutional investment in these programs.Methods:A 37-question online self-report survey was created using Survey Monkey? and distributed worldwide. We investigated (1) programmatic strategies utilized for smoking cessation, (2) the respondent?s perspective on the effectiveness of these strategies, (3) the structure with which these therapies are administered, and (4) overall organizational support for these treatments.Results:A total of 47 centers worldwide completed the survey. The most common methods of tobacco cessation were pharmacologic and nicotine replacement therapy (78% and 66%). However, only about half (47% and 50%, respectively) of the centers indicated that these strategies were effective. When asked whether a respondent?s center perceives that tobacco smoking should be a deciding factor in destination therapy evaluations, nearly a third (15, 32%) responded in the affirmative.Conclusion:While significant overlap exists among centers regarding treatments used for smoking cessation with left ventricular assist device patients, the most common treatments are not thought to be effective. While the current recommendations require tobacco smoking cessation in only bridge-to-transplant patients and not destination therapy patients, a number of centers disagree with the national guidelines and believe smoking should be prohibited in both populations.

AB  - Now that people on mobile devices can easily choose their mode of communication (e.g., voice, text, video), survey designers can potentially allow respondents to answer questions in whatever mode they find momentarily convenient given their circumstances or that they chronically prefer. We conducted an experiment to explore how mode choice affects response quality, participation, and satisfaction in smartphone interviews. A total of 1,260 iPhone users were contacted on their iPhones by either a human or an automated interviewer via voice or SMS text. This created four modes: Human Voice, Human Text, Automated Voice, and Automated Text. In half of the initial contacts, respondents were required to choose their interview mode (which could be the contact mode); in the remaining half, the mode was simply assigned. Respondents who chose their interview modes provided more conscientious (fewer rounded and non-differentiated) answers, and they reported greater satisfaction with the interview. Although fewer respondents started the interview when given a choice of mode, a higher percentage of Mode Choice respondents who started the interview completed it. For certain mode transitions (e.g., from automated interview modes), there was no reduction in participation. The results demonstrate clear benefits and relatively few drawbacks resulting from mode choice, at least among these modes and with this sample of iPhone users, suggesting that further exploration of mode choice and the logistics of its implementation is warranted.

AB  - Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) techniques are employed to mediate communication with people who have communication disorders, as in cases of intellectual disability. Although there are various digital solutions that promote alternative communication options for individuals with communication disorders, only a few of them have been specifically designed or targeted to people with intellectual disability (ID). This work is motivated by the lack of AAC solutions contributing to the rehabilitation processes of individuals with intellectual disability in Brazil. The study presents a mobile-based AAC solution conceived as a tool to assist the rehabilitation process of people with ID. The design was based on user-centered design principles and accessibility standards. The System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire was used to evaluate the solution. Four specialists and twenty-five students participated in this study. The proposed solution shows the potential educational value for professionals who assist individuals with intellectual disability in Brazil.

AB  - Background: Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a label-free analysis method for resolving bio-molecules or pharmaceuticals in the spatial domain. It offers unique perspectives for the examination of entire organs or other tissue specimens. Owing to increasing capabilities of modern MSI devices, the use of 3D and multi-modal MSI becomes feasible in routine applications-resulting in hundreds of gigabytes of data. To fully leverage such MSI acquisitions, interactive tools for 3D image reconstruction, visualization, and analysis are required, which preferably should be open-source to allow scientists to develop custom extensions. Findings: We introduce M2aia (MSI applications for interactive analysis in MITK), a software tool providing interactive and memory-efficient data access and signal processing of multiple large MSI datasets stored in imzML format. M2aia extends MITK, a popular open-source tool in medical image processing. Besides the steps of a typical signal processing workflow, M2aia offers fast visual interaction, image segmentation, deformable 3D image reconstruction, and multi-modal registration. A unique feature is that fused data with individual mass axes can be visualized in a shared coordinate system. We demonstrate features of M2aia by reanalyzing an N-glycan mouse kidney dataset and 3D reconstruction and multi-modal image registration of a lipid and peptide dataset of a mouse brain, which we make publicly available. Conclusions: To our knowledge, M2aia is the first extensible open-source application that enables a fast, user-friendly, and interactive exploration of large datasets. M2aia is applicable to a wide range of MSI analysis tasks.

AB  - There is an ongoing debate in the survey research literature about whether and when probability and nonprobability sample surveys produce accurate estimates of a larger population. Statistical theory provides a justification for confidence in probability sampling as a function of the survey design, whereas inferences based on nonprobability sampling are entirely dependent on models for validity. This article reviews the current debate about probability and nonprobability sample surveys. We describe the conditions under which nonprobability sample surveys may provide accurate results in theory and discuss empirical evidence on which types of samples produce the highest accuracy in practice. From these theoretical and empirical considerations, we derive best-practice recommendations and outline paths for future research.

AB  - Given the rapid rise of mobile-only users, we investigated the digital inclusion process through smartphones. By using Chile as a case study, a country that has strongly promoted mobile connections to address internet access gaps, we compared mobile-only and computer users in different dimensions of the digital inclusion process, including digital skills and differentiated uses of the web. By relying on a face-to-face national representative survey, the results showed that smartphones represent an opportunity to access the internet for those who traditionally lag behind. However mobile-only use does not necessarily lead to a more complete digital inclusion process because it was related to lower levels of skills and less diverse types of uses of the web compared to those people who also use the computer. Also, skills partially mediated the association between access device and types of uses of the web, which suggests that the differences by access device partly occur because people have greater chances to develop skills when accessing the web through computers.

AB  - As software systems have increased in complexity, manual testing has become harder or even infeasible. In addition, each test phase and application domain may have its idiosyncrasies in relation to testing automation. Techniques and tools to automate test oracles in domains such as graphical user interfaces are available; nevertheless, they are scarce in the virtual reality (VR) realm. We present an approach to automate software testing in VR-based systems with haptic interfaces - interfaces that allow bidirectional communication during human-computer interaction, capturing movements and providing touch feedback. It deals with the complexity and characteristics of haptic interfaces to apply the record and playback technique. Our approach also provides inference rules to identify possible faulty modules of the system under testing. A case study was performed with three systems: a system with primitive virtual objects, a dental anesthesia simulator and a game. Faulty versions of the systems were created by seeding faults manually and by using mutation operators. The results showed that 100% of the manually seeded faults and 93% of mutants were detected. Moreover, the inference rules helped identify the faulty modules of the systems, suggesting that the approach improves the test activity in VR-based systems with haptic interfaces.

AB  - Surveys completed on mobile web devices (smartphones) have been found to take longer than surveys completed on a PC. This has been found both in surveys where respondents can choose which device they use and in surveys where respondents are randomly assigned to devices. A number of potential explanations have been offered for these findings, including (1) slower transmission over cellular or Wi-Fi networks, (2) the difficulty of reading questions and selecting responses on a small device, and (3) the increased mobility of mobile web users who have more distractions while answering web surveys. In a secondary analysis of student surveys, we find that only about one-fifth of the time difference can be accounted for by transmission time (between-page time) with the balance being within-page time differences. Using multilevel models, we explore possible page-level (question-level) and respondent-level factors that may contribute to the time difference. We find that much of the time difference can be accounted for by the additional scrolling required on mobile devices, especially for grid questions.

AB  - Strategic, high quality HIV testing services (HTS) delivery is an essential step towards reaching the end of AIDS by 2030. We conducted HTS Data Use workshops in five African countries to increase data use for strategic program decision-making. Feedback was collected on the extent to which workshop skills and tools were applied in practice and to identify future capacity-building needs. We later conducted six semistructured phone interviews with workshop planning teams and sent a web-based survey to 92 past participants. The HTS Data Use workshops provided accessible tools that were readily learned by most respondents. While most respondents reported increased confidence in interpreting data and frequency of using such tools over time, planning team representatives indicated ongoing needs for more automated tools that can function across data systems. To achieve ambitious global HIV/AIDS targets, national decision makers may continue to seek tools and skill-building opportunities to monitor programs and identify opportunities to refine strategies.

AB  - In this paper, I argue for a need to expand our understanding of the role that self-help plays in the constitution of identities. Using the example of the Third Culture Kid (TCK) industry, I argue that self-help acts as a space of biopower through its role in managing the emotional experience of having been globally mobile as a child. To do this, the paper looks at how the TCK, as a subject, is surfaced as comfort in relation to the ascribed grief and insecurity of identity that is associated with childhood global mobility. Data are derived from a multi-sited ethnography, including a narrative analysis of TCK literature, reader discussions, participant observation at a TCK event and an online survey. The argument contributes to scholarly critiques of self-help by examining processes of production and consumption of TCK subjectivity enacted through the TCK industry. Thereby, the paper contends that in researching self-help we need a wider understanding of its production and consumption, how people are persuaded to use it, and how they respond to ideas presented within it.

AB  - This editorial provides an overview of the papers featured in this issue of Literacy. The first paper focus on the historical alignment of pleasurable reading with literary fiction and draw our attention to the variety of literacy practices in which humans engage, and the pleasures that are often generated as we respond to, through and around digital media. Next paper reports the findings of an empirical study which explored the role of the environment in influencing the reader's purpose, text type chosen and device selected. This paper focuses on the sociality of individual silent reading and the readers’ evident awareness of the presence and activity of others when they were reading. The third paper also encompasses awareness of the social nature of the reading experience but in the context of schooling and with reference to 8–14-year olds reading science-information books in Ireland. The next paper raises some more complex questions about the interaction between policy and literacy pedagogy in the social context of the classroom. The final paper links reading for pleasure to the creation of written texts. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The current study examines general text messaging tendencies, patterns of and reasons for texting family members, and the impact of texting on familial relationships among a young U.S. adult sample. Participants were recruited through Facebook; they then completed an online questionnaire. Data from 127 young adults (men: 38; women: 87; unidentified: 2) are analyzed and compared by gender. Findings suggest that young adults text at high rates per month. Participants generally report a prompt response to texts and their ability to honestly express feelings within these messages. Results also suggest participants text family members for a variety of reasons, such as to convey information, plan activities, and engage in general conversation. Distinct gender differences, however, are evident regarding who men and women text as well as texting's effects on familial relationships. Overall, these findings expand researchers' understanding of texting in general and its impact within the family. (C) 2013 Western Social Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objective To describe the creation and evaluate the use of a wiki by medical residents, and to determine if a wiki would be a useful tool for improving the experience, efficiency, and education of housestaff. Materials and methods In 2008, a team of medical residents built a wiki containing institutional knowledge and reference information using Microsoft SharePoint. We tracked visit data for 3 years, and performed an audit of page views and updates in the second year. We evaluated the attitudes of medical residents toward the wiki using a survey. Results Users accessed the wiki 23 218, 35 094, and 40 545 times in each of three successive academic years from 2008 to 2011. In the year two audit, 85 users made a total of 1082 updates to 176 pages and of these, 91 were new page creations by 17 users. Forty-eight percent of residents edited a page. All housestaff felt the wiki improved their ability to complete tasks, and 90%, 89%, and 57% reported that the wiki improved their experience, efficiency, and education, respectively, when surveyed in academic year 2009-2010. Discussion A wiki is a useful and popular tool for organizing administrative and educational content for residents. Housestaff felt strongly that the wiki improved their workflow, but a smaller educational impact was observed. Nearly half of the housestaff edited the wiki, suggesting broad buy-in among the residents. Conclusion A wiki is a feasible and useful tool for improving information retrieval for house officers.

AB  - Objective: To assess the performance of an active transcutaneous implantable-bone conduction device (TI-BCD), and to evaluate the benefit of device digital signal processing (DSP) features in challenging listening environments.Design: Participants were tested at 1- and 3-month post-activation of the TI-BCD. At each session, aided and unaided phoneme perception was assessed using the Ling-6 test. Speech reception thresholds (SRTs) and quality ratings of speech and music samples were collected in noisy and reverberant environments, with and without the DSP features. Self-assessment of the device performance was obtained using the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB) questionnaire.Study sample: Six adults with conductive or mixed hearing loss.Results: Average SRTs were 2.9 and 12.3 dB in low and high reverberation environments, respectively, which improved to −1.7 and 8.7 dB, respectively with the DSP features. In addition, speech quality ratings improved by 23 points with the DSP features when averaged across all environmental conditions. Improvement scores on APHAB scales revealed a statistically significant aided benefit.Conclusions: Noise and reverberation significantly impacted speech recognition performance and perceived sound quality. DSP features (directional microphone processing and adaptive noise reduction) significantly enhanced subjects’ performance in these challenging listening environments.

AB  - Hundreds of technical, special interest Internet weblogs are already generating thousands of niche articles worldwide, and many institutions are starting to create internal blogs for team collaboration. As this style of communication becomes more pervasive in the lives of employees and researchers, the difficulty of finding relevant information only grows with the number of authors and articles. To reduce the load, we propose using implicit group messaging (IGM) to automatically deliver relevant content to readers grouped by shared characteristics or interests. In this paper, we outline a context-aware application suited to special interest messaging and describe three alternative delivery models including our peer-to-peer (P2P) design called SPICE and a broker-based design. We investigate the advantages and disadvantages of each approach through detailed simulations driven by realistic data and actual national/global network topologies. We find that although a broker-based design is generally the most network efficient and lowest latency, a structured P2P system can offer exceptionally low and fair loading across peers and network links without relying on specialized broker nodes.

AB  - This article explores a significant yet curiously understudied form of transnational mobility as practiced by the highly qualified in Europe, namely the international internship. We argue that an international internship can be an ambivalent stage within youth transitions. While possibly providing a potential point of entry into a ‘dream’ career path, the economic and emotional costs of such undertakings also need to be accounted for, including an offsetting of professional stability and deferred rather than accelerated labour market entry. At the same time, international internships have the appearance of a response to a need for personal development and exploration. Taking on board these perspectives, we suggest that the international internship be considered a form of ‘mobile moratorium’, expanding on the possibilities associated with this conceptualisation. For young people in the European Union, this type of exchange also provides a means to engage in intra-European circulation while simultaneously pursuing personalized success. We investigate this proposition through analysis of data collected via an online survey, providing illustrations of what the international internship experience means for professional development and personal exploration.

AB  - For over 40 years, system response time has been a topic of interest and controversy in computer science. Since the late 1960s, the field has seen numerous studies conducted and articles written addressing the issue. Many factors were measured in these studies including: users' accuracy and error rates with different levels of system response time, user performance speed and the efficiency of the commands used, how user interactions with the computer changed as a result of changes in system response time, how their bodies reacted physiologically to those same changes and even how happy, satisfied, anxious or annoyed they were as system response times changed. In this paper, we summarize the major issues in system response time research and look at what can be concluded from them. Generally, researchers have suggested specific response-time guidelines based on the complexity of the task or the type of interaction with the computer. We suggest that rather than system response time being task- or expectation-focused, instead interactions with a computer fall into two categories: control tasks and conversational tasks. For control tasks, immediate response times are necessary for optimal user performance whereas for conversational tasks, some delays may be necessary to maintain the optimal pacing of the on-going conversation. The location and duration of these delays will depend on both task complexity and user expectations. Future system response time research is needed to further quantify limits of delay detection, and the location and duration of inter-task delays to optimize user performance and satisfaction with computers. © 2011 British Informatics Society Limited.

AB  - Evidence of comparability is generally needed whenever there are variations in the conditions of an assessment administration, including variations introduced by the administration of an assessment on multiple digital devices (e.g., tablet, laptop, desktop). This article is meant to provide a comprehensive examination of issues relevant to the comparability of scores across devices, and as such provide a starting point in designing and implementing a research agenda to support the comparability of any assessment program. This work starts with a conceptual framework rooted in the idea of a comparability claim—a conceptual statement about how each student is expected to perform on each of the devices in question. Then a review of the available literature is provided, focusing on how aspects of the devices (touch screens, keyboards, screen size, and displayed content) and aspects of the assessments (content area and item type) relate to student performance and preference. Building on this literature, recommendations to minimize threats to comparability are then provided. The article concludes with ways to gather evidence to support claims of comparability.

AB  - Learning in the cellular phone environment enables utilizing the multiple functions of the cellular phone, such as mobility, availability, interactivity, verbal and voice communication, taking pictures or recording audio and video, measuring time and transferring information. These functions together with mathematics-designated cellular phone applications facilitate authentic learning based on real-life phenomena, and widen the range of mathematical activities possible to carry out. This research shows that the cellular phone provides the mathematics students with rich, diverse and colourful learning environment in and out of the classroom. The participating students worked with the cellular phone to carry out activities involving formal mathematical phenomena and at the same time authentic real-life phenomena which they modelled mathematically. Doing so, they worked individually and collaboratively with diverse, specific and general mathematical concepts and at the same time practiced specific and general mathematical procedures, which expanded their mathematical knowledge and meta-knowledge. The cellular phone enabled the students to work with various representations of mathematical objects which encouraged them to investigate these objects independently or with the guidance of their teacher. The students also could tackle advanced mathematical objects intuitively based on their visual representation and actual realization in real-life situations. © The Author 2011.

AB  - A major challenge in web-based cross-cultural data collection is varying response rates, which can result in low data quality and non-response bias. Country-specific factors such as the political and demographic, economic, and technological factors as well as the socio-cultural environment may have an effect on the response rates to web surveys. This study evaluates web survey response rates using meta-analytical methods based on 110 experimental studies from seven countries. Three dependent variables, so-called effect sizes, are used: the web response rate, the response rate to the comparison survey mode, and the difference between the two response rates. The meta-analysis indicates that four country-specific factors (political and demographic, economic, technological, and socio-cultural) impact the magnitude of web survey response rates. Specifically, web surveys achieve high response rates in countries with high population growth, high internet coverage, and a high survey participation propensity. On the other hand, web surveys are at a disadvantage in countries with a high population age and high cell phone coverage. This study concludes that web surveys can be a reliable alternative to other survey modes due to their consistent response rates and are expected to be used more frequently in national and international settings.

AB  - Filter questions are used to administer follow-up questions to eligible respondents while allowing respondents who are not eligible to skip those questions. Filter questions can be asked in either the interleafed or the grouped formats. In the interleafed format, the follow-ups are asked immediately after the filter question; in the grouped format, follow-ups are asked after the filter question block. Underreporting can occur in the interleafed format due to respondents? desire to reduce the burden of the survey. This phenomenon is called motivated misreporting. Because smartphone surveys are more burdensome than web surveys completed on a computer or laptop, due to the smaller screen size, longer page loading times, and more distraction, we expect that motivated misreporting is more pronounced on smartphones. Furthermore, we expect that misreporting occurs not only in the filter questions themselves but also extends to data quality in the follow-up questions. We randomly assigned 3,517 respondents of a German online access panel to either the PC or the smartphone. Our results show that while both PC and smartphone respondents trigger fewer filter questions in the interleafed format than the grouped format, we did not find differences between PC and smartphone respondents regarding the number of triggered filter questions. However, smartphone respondents provide lower data quality in the follow-up questions, especially in the grouped format. We conclude with recommendations for web survey designers who intend to incorporate smartphone respondents in their surveys.

AB  - Mobile design and use has evolved immensely in the last decade, and we are in the middle of a paradigm shift in survey research, invoked by what Conrad et al, (2017) have termed 'the mobile revolution'. The mobile revolution poses opportunities and challenges to survey designers. Adopting a responsive and intelligent questionnaire design approach, where the visual presentation of content automatically adjusts to the device's screen size and browser, is seen as a way in which such problems can be addressed. This chapter investigates how different designs, optimized and non-optimized for smartphones, affect results in grid questions on different devices with different screen sizes. In a quasi-experiment implemented in 2015, the chapter compares response patterns in different grid designs. The main findings suggest that design choices with regard to visual presentation and functionality in grids may impact data quality, both for smartphone respondents and respondents using other devices. The chapter considers arguments for adapting questionnaires and grid questions specifically for mobile devices, summarizing what is known about the performance of grid questions on different devices and setting out the rationale for our research and the design of the study.

AB  - The present study employs an audience-centered approach to examine motivations for mobile fitness app use. We explicate and test an Integrated Technology Adoption model, which incorporates perspectives on competition, self-esteem, self-efficacy, and audience uses and gratifications. An online survey of 469 respondents reveals that app adoption intentions were predicted by internal competition orientations and gratifications, exercise self-efficacy, social utility motives, and attitudes toward the app. External competition decreased behavioral intentions related to app use. Study results thus provide support for an integrative model linking social cognitive factors with a new set of mobile app uses and gratifications. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Objective Little attention has been paid to understanding how engaging in cancer-related interpersonal exchanges via varying modes of communication influences psychological well-being among young adults with cancer. This study explored the moderating role of communication mode on the relationship of relational processes of disclosure and responsiveness with psychological well-being. Methods 61 young adults with cancer (M-age = 34.59, SD = 4.82) completed a questionnaire about their most recent cancer-related conversation. Participants reported on communication mode (ie, face-to-face, text message, and phone call) and relational processes of self- and support member- disclosure of thoughts, information, and feelings and how accepted, cared for, and understood they felt within the cancer-related conversation. Cancer adjustment measures included functional well-being and depressive symptoms. Results There were no main effects of communication mode or relational processes. However, communication mode did moderate the relationship between relational processes and cancer adjustment. Greater relational processes of disclosure and responsiveness were associated with better functional well-being and lower depressive symptoms only among those who engaged in their most recent cancer-related conversation through technology-related communication and not for those engaged in face-to-face communication. Conclusion Relational processes that are likely to benefit psychological adjustment after cancer appear to be particularly advantageous over technology-based communication. Young adults commonly report feelings of social isolation and psychological distress after cancer. These findings suggest that technology-related communication holds promise as a way to strengthen support-related communication and protect against distress.

AB  - This paper uses as its base a key initiative involving a not-for-profit organisation (NPO), government start-up funding and a social enterprise which evolved through three phases. The purpose of the initiative was the development of a smart phone technology platform for people with disability. The paper's purpose is to answer questions about the ways in which the mobile technology, seen here as assistive technologies, supported the development of disability citizenship and active citizenship. Data were collected through in-depth interviews conducted at three points in the 13-week programme during which participants with disability received customised support for their phone and training in its use, at no cost. Fifteen participants volunteered to take part in the research project, along with their significant other and service provider. Key themes were identified in the preliminary analysis. Exploring these using Ragnedda's ([2017]. The third digital divide: A Weberian approach to digital inequalities. Abingdon: Routledge) three levels of digital divide, and Wilson's ([2006]. The information revolution and developing countries. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press) categories of access allowed a series of philosophical, ethical and human services management questions to emerge, challenging the optimism with which the digital economy is presented as a solution to issues of inequality. Although the mobile technologies were very successful as assistive technologies for some participants, the findings reinforced the potential for such technologies to further entrench aspects of social exclusion. They also identified ways in which the shift in the role of the NPO to social entrepreneurship, and its relationships with government and private enterprise, had the potential to undermine the exercise of disability citizenship by turning participants into consumers.

Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among patients who completed a phase IIb open-label, multi-dose usability, tolerability, and safety study of subcutaneous belimumab (NCT02124798), in which patients receiving intravenous belimumab or subcutaneous belimumab using a prefilled syringe were switched to eight weekly self-administered doses of subcutaneous belimumab using the autoinjector. This follow-up study comprised an online/paper questionnaire and qualitative telephone interviews. Results: In total, 43 patients receiving belimumab completed the questionnaire, 21 of whom also completed a follow-up telephone interview. Qualitative interviews indicated that 17 of 21 (81%) patients had a positive experience using the autoinjector; all patients considered the autoinjector to be convenient. Of the 42 patients who switched from intravenous belimumab to the autoinjector, 32 (76%) expressed a preference for the autoinjector over intravenous administration; reasons included convenience, time saved, cost, and reduced injection pain. The most commonly reported disadvantage of the autoinjector was injection discomfort (n = 5 [24%]; qualitative interview). Compared with intravenous administration, the autoinjector improved ability to work (17 of 29 [59%] of those employed) and carry out daily activities (40%). Conclusion: Patients with SLE reported high levels of satisfaction with the belimumab autoinjector and preferred the autoinjector to intravenous administration, citing advantages such as time saved, cost, and improved ability to work and carry out daily activities.

AB  - Digital tools hold great promise to promote agricultural transformation and benefit smallholder farmers in the developing world. One such tool is Uber for tractors, which aims to enable farmers to access tractor hire services in a way that is deemed similar to the Uber service for ride-hailing. While widely praised, Uber for tractors has not yet been rigorously analyzed. How does it work in practice? And what is its potential to reduce the transaction costs of tractor service provision, both for tractor owners and for smallholders who use tractor services? To answer these questions, we present case studies of two companies that apply digital tools in support of tractor hire: Hello Tractor in Nigeria and EM3 Agri-Services in India. A transaction costs economics framework was developed to identify how Uber for tractor tools can, in theory, influence the attributes of service hire transactions and, thus, reduce transaction costs. For the empirical analysis, a mixed-methods approach was applied involving approximately 400 respondents and comprising net-maps (a participatory mapping tool), focus group discussions, interviews with tractor owners and other stakeholders, and a survey among farmers. Our results show that the Uber for tractor models have indeed the potential to reduce transaction costs for service providers, in particular the owners of several tractors, by enabling the monitoring of tractors and operators through GPS devices. Farmers who access services have, so far, only indirectly benefitted from the new digital tools, because they still relied on "analog" solutions booking agents and phone calls rather than a smartphone app to request services. Overall, the paper shows that Uber for tractors is a pioneering concept, but investment in enabling conditions, such as digital literacy and network coverage, is required to harness the full potential of such digital innovations for smallholder farmers in the developing world.

AB  - Across the developing world, the spread of mobile- and smartphones has led to a surge in mobile services for rural populations. While the potentials of mobile services to provide development opportunities for smallholder farmers are widely acknowledged, the potentials to use smartphone applications to collect data on smallholder farming systems are little explored. Yet, researchers studying farming systems need good quality data. So far, data on smallholder farming systems is typically collected using household surveys. Survey questions are prone to recall biases, however, which can be substantial. This paper assesses whether smartphone can be used to collect data in real time and thus increase the accuracy of socioeconomic and agronomic data collection. In this paper, we present a smartphone application that was developed for this purpose. We use the application to analyze the effects of agricultural mechanization on intra-household time-use and nutrition in rural Zambia. While the early, descriptive results shed interesting light on the effects of mechanization, the contribution of this study is primarily methodological. The study highlights the potentials of using smartphone applications to collect socioeconomic and agronomic data on smallholder-farming systems, potentially in real time. It also suggests ways to combine data recorded by respondents with built-in sensors of smartphones and external sensors and thus shows fascinating new pathways for researchers in the digital age.

AB  - Background: Smartphone-based disease management has become increasingly interesting for research in the field of bipolar disorders. This article investigates the attitudes of persons affected by this disorder towards the appropriation of mobile apps or assistance systems for the management of their disease. Methods: We conducted two separate studies. Study 1 was an online survey with 88 participants. In study 2 we consulted 15 participants during a semi-structured interview. All the participants had formerly been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Results: More than half of the participants of study 1 and most participants of study 2 agreed with the use of an app or assistance system for self-ratings, third party ratings and an objective symptom monitoring. Potential interventions that were popular in both groups included a regular feedback, the visualization of monitored data and advice in crises. Limitations: With study 1 we were not able to ensure correct diagnoses or to interact in a flexible way. In Study 2 those issues were resolved, but the small number of participants raises the question of a possible generalisability of the results. Furthermore, for both studies a selection bias could not be excluded. Conclusions: Our results indicate positive attitudes of bipolar patients towards disease management apps and assistance systems. Even new and innovative features such as partner apps or the analysis of facial expressions in video data were appreciated and daily interactions were favoured. However, the variety of answers calls for flexible systems which allow activating or deactivating certain features. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study examines the causal-effect relationship between telecommunication infrastructures, economic growth and development in selected African countries. It further estimates the trivariate impacts of telecommunication infrastructures, economic growth and development in the region. The analysis considers a panel of forty-six African countries from 2000 to 2015. To measure economic growth, real gross domestic product serves as the proxy, while economic development is measured by the Human Development Index, and telecommunication infrastructures by a composite index of telecommunication computed from mobile line, fixed line and internet access penetration via principal component analysis (PCA). The empirical results suggest the existence of a bidirectional long-run relationship between telecommunication infrastructures, economic growth and development. The causality tests reveal that there is feedback causality between telecommunication infrastructures, economic growth and development. Telecommunication infrastructures promote economic growth and development in Africa and vice versa. Thus, there is need to promote inclusive and holistic policies that will enhance digital provide, economic growth and development simultaneously in Africa. An increase in telecommunication infrastructures will encourage aggregate output and standard of living to move in the same direction in Africa. • Feedback relationships exist between telecommunication, economic growth and development in Africa. • Telecommunication, economic growth and development are interdependent in Africa. • Telecommunication, economic growth and development need concurrent overhaul in Africa.

AB  - Globalization, technological development and a dynamic business environment influence the change of customer information demands. It becomes vital for organizations to find out the customer demand change and discover technological solutions to satisfy these demands. One of these technologies is augmented reality, which connects real and digital environments by expanding it with digitally coded information which is decoded by using a specific device. As this type of technology enables the changing information needs of customers to be met faster, organizations are increasingly using these technological solutions to achieve a variety of purposes: to position products innovatively, increase product awareness, create added value for the customer, increase sales. However, organizations often face the challenge of evaluating commercial augmented reality mobile applications in user experience. A two-case study has been selected to evaluate the user experience of augmented reality commercial mobile applications and provide recommendations for their development to address this issue. In this research, such methods as scoping scientific literature review, expert evaluation, and user experience questionnaire method were used. The study has identified the main factors influencing the positive user experience: the explicit purpose of the application, easy to use and learn, smooth operation, imaginative information presentation, and interactivity.

AB  - In a digital society, we are frequently invited to communicate our present affective state via interfaces. These include smart-phone apps which allow users to track their mood in 'real-time', plus touchpads in organisations and public spaces which seek rapid feedback on whether an experience is positive or negative. In contrast to the use of surveys as tools of valuation, these technologies seek to capture experience in 'real-time', which can then be viewed and evaluated critically at a later time. Based on study of a number of mood-monitoring technologies, this paper highlights some of the ways in which they challenge conventional accounts of (e) valuation. In particular, rather than inviting individuals to represent their feelings towards the past numerically, they invite them to make uncritical expressions of positive or negative mood in the present. The central question of value is no longer how much is something valued, but whether or not it is valued. Quantitative and calculated analysis of positive and negative emotions occurs subsequently.

AB  - Rapid advances in tablet technology and the increasing availability of electronic survey applications provide opportunities to streamline on-site human dimensions data collection. This article compares response rates and cost efficiencies of an iPad interface used for on-site survey administration to other types of human dimensions of wildlife survey administration response rates and expenses. Results also illustrate respondents' interface preference from a recent survey administered at National Wildlife Refuges and National Parks across the United States. Refuge and Park visitors enjoyed taking on-site surveys on iPads more than traditional paper surveys, and indicated a preference for taking future surveys on iPads instead of paper (t = 21.64, p < .001, η = .39); iPad survey administration was more cost efficient for large (over 1,350) survey samples, and garnered a higher than average response rate than online and mail surveys, but similar to average response rates for on-site intercept survey administration.

AB  - This study investigates why and which types of college and research libraries (CRLs) are currently developing makerspaces (or an equivalent space) for their communities. Based on an online survey and phone interviews with a sample population of CRLs in New England, I found that 26 CRLs had or were in the process of developing a makerspace in this region. In addition, several other CRLs were actively promoting and diffusing the maker ethos. Of these libraries, most were motivated to promote open access to new technologies, literacies, and STEM-related knowledge.

AB  - An increasing portion of the contemporary workforce is using mobile devices to create new kinds of work-space flows characterized by emergence, liquidity, and the blurring of all kinds of boundaries. This changes the traditional notion of the term workplace. The present study focuses on how people enact and make sense of new work space boundaries enabled by their mobile practices. A unique method of data collection -- the use of cultural probes -- was adapted to an online format to facilitate participant reflection and documentation of mobile practices. Coupled with in-depth interviews, this methodology enabled the thick description of how individuals enacted spatial, temporal, and psychosocial boundaries of work spaces through their mobile practices. Key findings include (a) evidence of the increasing individuation of work space enacted through mobile devices, (b) an observable collapse in the boundaries between work and personal/leisure domains, (c) diversity in an individual's sensemaking about reconstituted lifespace, and (d) evolving social norms as prior office-based norms are called into question. These findings contribute a more accurate picture of the contemporary workplace by providing insight into what kinds of work space, time, and psychosocial structures and flows are emerging through mobile practices -- insight that bears on designing, developing, and managing the workplace under conditions of mobile technology use.

AB  - The definition of what it means to take a test online continues to evolve with the inclusion of a broader range of item types and a wide array of devices used by students to access test content. To assure the validity and reliability of test scores for all students, device comparability research should be conducted to evaluate the impact of testing device on student test performance. The current study looked at the comparability of test scores across tablets and computers for high school students in three commonly assessed content areas and for a variety of different item types. Results indicate no statistically significant differences across device type for any content area or item type. Student survey results suggest that students may have a preference for taking tests on devices with which they have more experience, but that even limited exposure to tablets in this study increased positive responses for testing on tablets.

AB  - The growing role that information and communication technologies (ICTs) play in everyday interactions should not be understood as constituting a special realm of exchange, separated from or concurrent to face-to-face interpersonal interactions. Rather, we see in this process a set of small but significant displacements inside a larger relational system. Thus, we need to approach the multifaceted dialectic between ICT usages and individual relational resources by examining the incorporation of communication tools into everyday life practices. To analyze the interweaving of ICTs and sociability, we combine various datasets: individual questionnaires, telephone and Internet traffic measures, and qualitative studies. Our analysis is based on a statistically representative panel study of 2,370 French individuals, which ran in 2005 and 2006, and articulated different data sources by mixing different research techniques: (1) detailed mobile and fixed telephone communication data from billing records; (2) home computer usage data, collected via a software installed on the panelists' computers, and providing individual-level data on Web, mail, and global PC activity; and (3) phone and paper questionnaires, administrated periodically all along the eighteen months of observation. We mobilize these three data sources together with a specific contact diary study performed with a selected subsample of ten households where all the members were interviewed in depth about their social practices and networks (for more details on our research methodology, see Smoreda et al., 2007). We will first analyze the scope of the interweaving of various voice and text communication tools that mobilize telephony, short message service (SMS), instant messenger (IM), and/or e-mail as well as the factors behind their usage. By looking at the intensity of usage and the various means of communication, we will see how five different usage profiles organize actual communication tools into differentiated patterns. Second, we will analyze how age cohorts structure the equipment penetration rate as well as the trade-offs between communication tools between generations. Finally, we will examine the interweaving of tools and relations spread over various social networks and the local negotiation in family and marital logics to emphasize the role of family socialization frameworks in ICT usage.

AB  - Purpose:To analyze the impact of mobile electronic devices (MEDs) and apps in the daily clinical activity of young radiation or clinical oncologists in 5 Western European countries (Italy, Germany, Spain, Portugal, and Denmark).Methods:A web-based questionnaire was sent to 462 young (≤40 years) members of the national radiation or clinical oncology associations of the countries involved in the study. The 15 items investigated diffusion of MEDs (smartphones and/or tablets), their impact on daily clinical activity, and the differences perceived by participants along time.Results:A total of 386 (83.5%) of the 462 correctly filled questionnaires were statistically evaluated. Up to 65% of respondents declared to use an electronic device during their clinical activity. Conversely, 72% considered low to moderate impact of smartphones/tables on their daily practice. The daily use significantly increased from 2009 to 2012: users reporting a use ≥6 times/d raised from 5% to 39.9%. Professional needs fulfillment was declared by less than 68% of respondents and compliance to apps indications by 66%. Significant differences were seen among the countries, in particular concerning the feeling of usefulness of MEDs in the daily clinical life. The perception of the need of a comprehensive Web site containing a variety of applications (apps) for clinical use significantly differed among countries in 2009, while it was comparable in 2012.Conclusions:This survey showed a large diffusion of MEDs in young professionals working in radiation oncology. Looking at these data, it is important to verify the consistency of information found within apps, in order to avoid potential errors eventually detrimental for patients. ?Quality assurance? criteria should be specifically developed for medical apps and a comprehensive Web site gathering all reliable applications and tools might be useful for daily clinical practice.

AB  - With the growing popularity of smartphones and tablet PCs (tablets) equipped with mobile browsers, the possibilities to administer surveys via mobile devices have expanded. To investigate the possible mode effect on answer behavior, results are compared between a mobile device?assisted web survey and a computer-assisted web survey. First, a premeasurement in the CentERpanel is conducted to analyze the user group of mobile devices. Second, the users are randomly allocated one of the three conditions: (1) conventional computer-assisted web survey, (2) hybrid version: a computer-assisted web survey with a layout similar to mobile web survey, and (3) mobile web survey. Special attention is given to the design of the mobile web questionnaire, taking small screen size, and typical functionalities for touchscreens into account. The findings suggest that survey completion on mobile devices need not lead to different results than on computers, but one should be prepared for a lower response rate and longer survey completion time. Further, the study offers considerations for researchers on survey satisfaction, location during survey completion, and preferred device to access Internet. With adaptations, surveys can be conducted on the newest mobile devices, although new challenges are emerging and further research is called for.

AB  - This article investigates unintended mobile access to surveys in online, probability-based panels. We find that spontaneous tablet usage is drastically increasing in web surveys, while smartphone usage remains low. Further, we analyze the bias of respondent profiles using smartphones and tablets compared to those using computers, on the basis of several sociodemographic characteristics. Our results indicate not only that mobile web respondents differ from PC users but also that tablet users differ from smartphone users. While tablets are used for survey completion by working (young) adults, smartphones are used merely by the young. In addition, our results indicate that mobile web respondents are more progressive and describe themselves more often as pioneers or forerunners in adopting new technology, compared to PC respondents. We further discover that respondents? preferences for devices to complete surveys are clearly in line with unintended mobile response. Finally, we present a similar analysis on intended mobile response in an experiment where smartphone users were requested to complete a mobile survey. Based on these findings, testing on tablets is strongly recommended in online surveys. If the goal is to reach young respondents, enabling surveys via smartphones should be considered.

AB  - This research note presents the results of an experiment that investigated how response rates and data quality could be improved for smartphone web surveys. First, we compare how invitations by text message versus by e-mail affect response rate. Text message invitations result in a similar total response rate as e-mail invitations when considering response via all types of online devices. When considering response via smartphones only, the survey completion rate is significantly higher. The text message contact mode also leads to a faster speed of initial response. Second, we examine the response effects of several questionnaire-design choices when using smartphones: paging versus scrolling, horizontal versus vertical question layout, number of answer options, and open-ended versus closed-ended questions. According to our findings, a scrolling layout leads to a shorter completion time than a paging layout. We further suggest that caution be used with horizontal and long-answer scales as well as open-ended text answer fields in smartphone surveys.

AB  - As indoor wayfinding can be very challenging, adapted systems, which adapt the route instruction type, are being developed to facilitate more supportive indoor route guidance. In this study, such a system has been developed based on the results of an online survey. This adapted system was compared with a non-adapted system by use of eye tracking, position tracking, an orientation test and a questionnaire. The results revealed that using symbols instead of photos reduced the imposed cognitive load, while using 3D-simulations instead of photos improved the environmental awareness. This resulted in less wayfinding errors with the adapted system, compared to the non-adapted system. Therefore, the present study provides additional evidence on the benefits of adapted systems for indoor route guidance.

AB  - To be able to design indoor wayfinding systems that adhere better to the needs of the users, user perception on complexity needs to be examined and linked to user characteristics and decision point characteristics. To identify how these characteristics influence perception, an online survey is executed in which participants had to indicate how complex they found a decision point, while interpreting a route instruction. The results show that complexity ratings depend both on user characteristics and on the function of the decision point. Decision points to change levels, start or end a route and to take turns each received significantly different complexity ratings. Isovist and visibility graph analysis characteristics of these decision points show that the first two actions were perceived as more complex when they took place in a narrow hallway, while the third action was perceived as more complex in a convex space. The results of this study can be used in the design of an adaptive wayfinding system that adapts the route instructions to the perceived decision point complexity. This adaptation will adhere better to the needs of the users compared to an adaptation based on solely theoretical complexity.

AB  - Objective: To determine the efficacy of portable electronic aids such as personal digital assistants (PDAs), pagers or mobile phones for patients with cognitive deficits by means of a systematic review. The usability of these aids is also briefly discussed. Data sources: PubMed, CINAHL, PsychINFO, EMBASE and MEDLINE were searched up to February 2009. The references of identified and relevant articles were scanned to find additional relevant titles. Review methods: Papers referring to ‘electronic aids’, ‘cognition’ and ‘brain injury’ were included. The population had to be adult and have cognitive impairments as a result of acquired brain injury. Outcome measures were change in cognitive or occupational performance or the level of participation in daily life. The criteria of Cicerone et al. were used to evaluate the quality of the retrieved studies. Results: Twenty-eight papers presenting 25 studies were reviewed. The total number of participants was 423. Most identified papers described case reports or non-randomized clinical trials. Only one randomized controlled trial was identified, in which the NeuroPage proved effective in supporting prospective memory. Other kinds of assistive technology such as PDAs and voice recorders showed positive results in supporting retrospective and prospective memory. Conclusion: The efficacy of assistive technology in general is not yet sufficiently studied in randomized controlled trials, although promising results has been reported. Furthermore, several survey studies established that both potential users and clinicians have optimistic expectations about the usability of assistive technology.

AB  - In this paper, the authors suggest the merger of the Massively Open Online Course (MOOC) format and mobile learning (mLearning) based on mutual affordances of both contemporary learning/teaching formats to investigate learner interactions and dialogues in an open online course. The paper presents a case study of how MobiMOOC, a course created using the MOOC format, demonstrates the synergistic characteristics between the MOOC format and mLearning, making a combination of both fields ideal for contemporary, digital, collaborative learning, and knowledge construction based on learner interactions and dialogue. MobiMOOC was a six-week online course focusing on mLearning that ran in April and May 2011. An end-of-course survey provides insight that supports the synergies between MOOCs and mLearning: collaboration, informal and lifelong learning, and dialogue.

AB  - Competition and economic regulation policies have traditionally been based on the conception of a "standard" consumer who is perfectly rational, has a high level of computational skills, and is invariant to the environment in which choices are made. An ever-expanding body of research concludes that, for a variety of reasons, consumers often behave in various "non-standard" ways. In light of this research, some economic regulators and competition authorities are replacing the concept of the standard consumer with the concept of the non-standard consumer. This is justified on the basis that it is more realistic and offers the potential for more effective policies anchored in the behavior of actual consumers. While there are persuasive arguments for adopting a concept of the non-standard consumer, effectively integrating non-standard consumers into relevant policies raises conceptual challenges and risks, some of which have been borne out in practice. In particular, attention needs to be given to: the specific nature of the non-standard consumer behavior; the relative proportion of consumers characterized by non-standard behavior; possible supplier responses to remedial measures; and critically, the potential unintended effects of such policies. If these parameters and challenges are acknowledged and effectively incorporated into analytical frameworks, the potential exists for better-targeted competition and regulatory policies.

AB  - Veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder are at high risk for smoking and experience difficulty with smoking cessation. We designed this clinical demonstration project to provide a low-cost, feasibly implemented smoking cessation intervention that would maximize the number of smokers who accessed the intervention. Five hundred eighty-four veteran smokers were contacted by invitational letters. Interested veterans received follow-up telephone calls using standardized scripts offering three intervention resources: 1) a referral to the National Cancer Institute's Smoking Quitline, 2) web-based counseling, and 3) local Veteran Affairs pharmacologic treatment for smoking cessation. Twenty-three percent of survey recipients participated in the clinical program. Two months after these resources were offered by phone, follow-up phone calls indicated that 25% of participants providing follow-up information reported maintaining smoking abstinence. This clinical demonstration project was associated with a 2.6% impact (i.e., reach [31.1% of smokers accessed intervention] by efficacy [8.4% of those accessing intervention quit]), meaning that 2.6% of the total number of targeted smokers reported 8 week abstinence. Results suggested that this brief, low cost intervention was feasible and promoted smoking cessation in veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder.

However, in those years, mixed-mode strategies remained part of the daily survey practice, although the type of mix implemented followed the changes in technology and data collection methods. In this paper, I summarize the state of the art in traditional mixed-mode surveys and discuss implications for mixed device surveys.

AB  - Although theory suggests that financial market imperfections - mainly information asymmetries, market segmentation and transaction costs - prevent poor people from escaping poverty by limiting their access to formal financial services, new financial technologies (FinTech) are seen as key enablers of financial inclusion. Indeed, the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (UN-2030-ASD) and the G20 High-Level Principles for Digital Financial Inclusion (G20-HLP-DFI) highlight the importance of harnessing the potential of FinTech to reduce financial exclusion and income inequality. This paper investigates the interrelationship between FinTech, financial inclusion and income inequality for a panel of 140 countries using the Global Findex waves of survey data for 2011, 2014 and 2017. We posit that FinTech affects inequality directly and indirectly through financial inclusion. We invoke quantile regression analysis to investigate whether such effects differ across countries with different levels of income inequality. We uncover new evidence that financial inclusion is a key channel through which FinTech reduces income inequality. We also find that while financial inclusion significantly reduces inequality at all quantiles of the inequality distribution, these effects are primarily associated with higher-income countries. Overall, our results support the aspirations of the UN-2030-ASD and G20-HLP-DFI.

The authors reviewed published guidelines for the design of Web-based clinical systems for elderly patients and identified additional design considerations that have not been reported in the literature. The resulting recommendations are related to the system interface, the training and support of users, and the content of Web pages. The recommendations can be used as design objectives for Web-based systems for elderly patients, which emphasize system usability and aim to optimize patients' error-free use of these systems.

AB  - This paper presents and discusses the initial findings of a mobile language learning project undertaken in the context of an undergraduate distance-learning French language programme at The Open University (UK). The overall objective of the project was to investigate students' experiences when using their own portable devices for additional listening and speaking practice within a course. Experience data were collected via weekly online questionnaires, recorded oral feedback and email. The use of iPods and MP3 players was quickly adopted by project participants; but whilst the challenge and the authentic aspect of doing activities on the phone appealed to some learners, we conclude that other learners will need to be helped towards recognizing the specific value of this type of practice as a stepping stone towards authentic communication. We suggest further areas of investigation and potential applications. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - There is a growing understanding that the 'power' of information technology is as much about its ability to judiciously filter out some information streams, its ability to help us assimilate data and ease cognitive load, as it is about accessing new streams and accruing greater quantities of data. Powerful digital technologies are as much about selectivity as they are about speed, capacity, or sensitivity. It is in the midst of that popular recognition that the iPhone (and perhaps the Apple brand in general) has emerged as an icon. The conventional wisdom that it 'just works'—its interoperability and functional resilience, the intuitive design of its interface, its visual and tactile harmonies—ameliorates a gnawing mass anxiety rooted in complexity. It is all too easy to overlook that the iPhone is not just an apparatus but an assemblage, a nexus of social, institutional, and material relations 'made concrete.' What proportion of the cost of the iPhone (real or effective, externalized or otherwise) is incurred not in the labor of its production and design or the raw materials of its physical components but in its attendant 'intangibles'—licenses, intellectual property, storage capacity, and bandwidth? Does the widening gulf between our pedestrian experience of such devices and their arcane 'insides'—arguably, some of the very complexities they are designed to alleviate—warrant analytic or political concern? Further, what is the cultural significance of this 'iceberg' quality, the fact that a growing proportion of our everyday experience is opaque to the casual observer, residing 'beneath the surface' of lay scrutiny and held fast within a dense technosocial matrix? This chapter considers these questions through what in many ways is a quite traditional anthropological approach. In particular, the author analyzes three artifacts of digital culture and their realization within the iPhone and its users and principal competitors: the 'end-user licensing agreement,' or EULA; the coder-decoder, or 'codec'; and the 'application programming interface,' or API. Constituting wholly distinct facets of the typical 'digital multimedia device,' they serve to illustrate the social and political relevance of the immaterial and the opaque.

AB  - The internet is seen as a challenging workspace for Corporate Communication & Information Management purposes. It enables a growing number of people to publish, share & relay information on any subject. The recent emergence of user-friendly content creation tools & networking facilities has increased that phenomenon & brought new settings to the informational landscape of organizations. We argue that the evolution of internet has created new needs in practices & theoretical understanding of information quality assessment & source selection. Based on a survey of corporate information specialists in the private sector in Belgium, the study examines the perceived shift of information quality assessment criteria when dealing with online sources. This paper aims to present a conciliation of usual information evaluation criteria to five formats of information sources, considered as specific to what people call Web 2.0: weblogs, wikis, podcasts, file sharing platforms & social networks sites. 53 phone interviews were conducted in 2008. Results confirms the existence of a perceived shift in the information quality assessment process. They suggests that it remains globally the same, but that it mostly needs to be adapted to better cope with the new reality of sources formats. Nuances to this observation are discussed in this paper. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Background Adherence to medications for treating alcohol use disorder (AUD) is poor. To identify predictors of daily naltrexone adherence over time, a secondary data analysis was conducted of a trial evaluating a mobile health intervention to improve adherence. Methods Participants seeking treatment for AUD (n = 58; Mage = 38 years; 71% male) were prescribed naltrexone for 8 weeks. Adherence was tracked using the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS). In response to daily text messages, participants reported the previous day's alcohol use, craving, and naltrexone side effects. Using multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM), we examined baseline dispositional factors and within-person, time-varying factors as predictors of daily adherence. Results Naltrexone adherence decreased over time. Adherence was higher on days when individuals completed daily mobile assessments relative to days when they did not (odds ratio [OR] = 2.53, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.61 to 3.98), irrespective of intervention condition. Days when individuals drank more than their typical amount were related to lower next-day adherence (OR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.99). A similar pattern was supported for craving (OR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.98). Weekend days were associated with lower adherence than weekdays (OR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.86); this effect was partly mediated by heavier daily drinking (indirect effect = -0.02, 95% CI -0.04 to -0.003) and stronger-than-usual craving (indirect effect = -0.01, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.00) on weekend days. Conclusions The results further demonstrate the need to improve adherence to AUD pharmacotherapy. The present findings also support developing interventions that target daily-level risk factors for nonadherence. Mobile health interventions may be one means of developing tailored and adaptive adherence interventions.

AB  - Clinical study data management systems (CSDMSs) have many similarities to clinical patient record systems (CPRSs) in their focus on recording clinical parameters. Requirements for ad hoc query interfaces for both systems would therefore appear to be highly similar. However, a clinical study is concerned primarily with collective responses of groups of subjects to standardized therapeutic interventions for the same underlying clinical condition. The parameters that are recorded in CSDMSs tend to be more diverse than those required for patient management in non-research settings, because of the greater emphasis on questionnaires for which responses to each question are recorded separately. The differences between CSDMSs and CPRSs are reflected in the metadata that support the respective systems' operation, and need to be reflected in the query interfaces. The authors describe major revisions of their previously described CSDMS ad hoc query interface to meet CSDMS needs more fully, as well as its porting to a Web-based platform.

AB  - Personal computing has become all about mobile and embedded devices. As a result, the adoption rate of smartphones is rapidly increasing and this trend has set a need for mobile applications to be available at anytime, anywhere and on any device. Despite the obvious advantages of such immersive mobile applications, software developers are increasingly facing the challenges related to device fragmentation. Current application development solutions are insufficiently prepared for handling the enormous variety of software platforms and hardware characteristics covering the mobile eco-system. As a result, maintaining a viable balance between development costs and market coverage has turned out to be a challenging issue when developing mobile applications. This article proposes a context-aware software platform for the development and delivery of self-adaptive mobile applications over the Web. An adaptive application composition approach is introduced, capable of autonomously bypassing context-related fragmentation issues. This goal is achieved by incorporating and validating the concept of fine-grained progressive application enhancements based on a multicriteria decision-making strategy.

AB  - This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of empirical research on object-oriented (OO) design. Many claims about the cognitive benefits of the OO paradigm have been made by its advocates. These claims concern the ease of designing and reusing software at the individual level as well as the benefits of this paradigm at the team level. Since these claims are cognitive in nature, it seems important to assess them empirically. After a brief presentation of the main concepts of the OO paradigm, the claims about the superiority of OO design are outlined. The core of this paper consists of a review of empirical studies of OO design (OOD). We first discuss results concerning OOD by individuals. On the basis of empirical work, we (1) analyse the design activity of novice OO designers, (2) compare OOD with procedural design and (3) discuss a typology of problems relevant for the OO approach. Then we assess the claims about naturalness and ease of OOD. The next part discusses results on OO software reuse. On the basis of empirical work, we (1) compare reuse in the OO versus the procedural paradigm, (2) discuss the potential for OO software reuse and (3) analyse reuse activity in the OO paradigm. Then we assess claims on reusability. The final part reviews empirical work on OOD by teams. We present results on communication, coordination, knowledge dissemination and interactions with clients. Then we assess claims about OOD at the software design team level. In a general conclusion, we discuss the limitations of these studies and give some directions for future research. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - People who routinely cross borders for their jobs are often cast as beneficiaries of globalisation. But in a world of economic downturns, un- or underemployment as well as political unrest access to an increasingly global market becomes the personal and organisational solution to a host of unwanted happenings. In these circumstances, it therefore becomes less clear whether the heightened mobility of transnational workers is a benefit or indeed a choice. This article examines the onus placed on employees to be geographically mobile for their jobs. Relocation enables organisations to operate in expanding transnational markets and fields; it is therefore a prerequisite of jobs in an increasing number of sectors. Through systematic comparison of the attitudes to mobility of highly skilled employees in a 'market' (corporate) and a 'moral' (UN) case-study organisation, this article makes a contribution to our understanding of work orientations in transnational institutions. It interrogates the myth of choice of highly skilled movers and identifies the aspirations, contradictions and dilemmas that are associated with relocating for their jobs. Analysis of biographical interviews in tandem with online survey data elucidates the complex ways that the competing repertoires of choice and compliance are woven into transnational narratives.

AB  - In Malaysian schools the learning of science does not reflect the nature of science. An instructional module which could address the need for teaching science through a process of scientific discovery and collaboration is required. A developmental research approach with three phases was used to design a collaborative m-Learning module for a topic in science. In the first phase of analysis, a survey of 158 students’ use of technology and the perception of the use of computers and mobile phones was completed. Data from the analysis phase indicated the students’ readiness in using online tools such as discussion forums and text messaging with mobiles for learning. Computers were perceived to be useful for learning, but mobile phones were not. The findings from the first phase were used to determine the learning tools to utilize in the design of the module in the second phase. The online learning tools used are wikis and discussion forums. In addition, text messaging using the mobile phone was also employed for individualized quizzes. The collaborative m-Learning module designed, was evaluated by experts for further improvements. The findings indicate that the experts agree that a collaborative Learning module with a variety of learning tools such as wikis, discussion forum and text messaging, could be used for teaching science. In addition, this module could also be used for teaching other subjects. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Parents are the main mediators of the digital exposure and experiences of young children. When adopting a parental mediation style, they are challenged by a dilemma: protecting their children often means invading their privacy and restricting their options. The adopted parental mediation style is pondered according to the perceptions and experiences of parents regarding digital media; it is an ongoing and dynamic negotiation between the actions of parents and children. Our research focuses on mobile apps, since the favourite devices of young children are smartphones and tablets, in order to explore how parents and children select apps, and which criteria they use. Our fieldwork was conducted in Portugal and used a mixed method, combining an online survey to a purposive sample of 1955 parents of children under 8 years old, and separate interviews to parents and children under 8 to a purposive sample of 81 families. Our results reveal how parents are coping with contrasting perceptions on digital media and how they negotiate their parental mediation style in interaction with their children. Parents believe more in building trust than in restricting children, but when they find it necessary, their will to protect overcomes their respect for the children's privacy.

AB  - Innovations of information and communication technologies (ICTs) have influenced human life through time-saving, diffusion of knowledge, easy communication, and networks, access to information and automation with artificial intelligence. They not only increase productivity, cut-down hardship, improve transparency and governance, build social capital and empower individuals but also raise risks of cyber threats and insecurity of private life, displace labours, encourage sedentary life-style and digitally divide individuals in the society etc. These together do not seem to have unambiguous impacted on the aggregate wellbeing and progress (WPI) of a nation, and thus this paper empirically examined their resultant relationship at the aggregate level. An index of WPI has been prepared to account for the aggregate level of satisfaction derived from six sources, namely economic, human, progress, cultural, environmental wellbeing and happiness. Similarly, an index of ICT exposure has been constructed by combining access to mobile, internet and telephone connections, and internet security. Using a panel database for 67 countries representing all subcontinents during 2000–2014, we find that ICT exposure positively improves the aggregate level of WPI. The net impact is marginally lower in less-developed and developing countries (e.g., Africa, Asia, and the Middle East) than the rest (e.g., Europe and North America).

AB  - Das Schlagwort "Smart Home" verspricht eine intelligente, hilfreiche Umgebung, in der die Technik das Leben der Bewohner erleichtert, vereinfacht oder sicherer macht. Auf technischer Ebene wird dies derzeit durch viele vernetzte Geräte erreicht, die miteinander interagieren und mit gemeinsamen Protokollen und Standards arbeiten. Aus Sicht der Benutzererfahrung (UX) ist die Interaktion mit einer solchen Ansammlung von Geräten jedoch so komplex geworden, dass sie einer breiten Akzeptanz und Nutzung derzeit eher im Wege steht. Bisher scheint es unwahrscheinlich, dass sich ein gemeinsames Konzept für die Benutzerschnittstelle (UI) als Quasi-Standard herausbilden wird, wie es bei der Desktop-Schnittstelle für grafische UIs der Fall war. Daher verfolgt unsere Forschung einen anderen Ansatz. Anstelle vieler einzelner intelligenter Geräte stellen wir uns ein UI-Konzept für intelligente Umgebungen vor, das verschiedene Technologien in ein kohärentes mentales Modell einer verkörperten "Raumintelligenz" (RI) integriert. Die RI wird intelligente Maschinen, mobile Roboterarme und alltägliche physische Objekte miteinander verbinden und so die Grenzen zwischen der physischen und der digitalen Welt verwischen. Der vorliegende Beitrag beschreibt unsere Vision und die sich daraus ergebenden Forschungsfragen und stellt die ersten Schritte der technischen Umsetzung vor. (translated by DeepL)

AB  - In this chapter, we present a new randomizing device. It uses a 'randomizing question' and comprises several desirable properties. Besides its ease of use and its applicability in all survey situations, it allows for increasing the statistical efficiency of the Randomized Response Technique (RRT) without jeopardizing respondents' perceived privacy protection. For the latter, the method makes use of Benford's law and takes advantage of respondents' misperception of the properties of Benford-distributed numbers such as, in our example, house numbers. We show how this method can be implemented and we present results of its first large-scale empirical evaluation in an online survey on student cheating. Furthermore, we will discuss the important difference between respondents' objective privacy protection in RRT designs and their subjectively perceived privacy protection.

AB  - The use of new technologies such internet (e-mail, chat rooms) and cell phones has steeply increased in recent years. Especially among children and young people, use of technological tools and equipments is widespread. Although many teachers and administrators now recognize the problem of school bullying, few are aware that students are being harassed through electronic communication. Referred to as electronic bullying, cyber bullying, or online social cruelty, this phenomenon includes bullying through email, instant messaging, in a chat room, on a website, or through digital messages or images sent to a cell phone. Cyber bullying is defined as causing deliberate/intentional harm to others using internet or other digital technologies. It has a quantitative research design and uses relational survey as its method. The participants consisted of 300 secondary school students in the city of Konya, Turkey. 195 (64.8%) participants were female and 105 (35.2%) were male. 39 (13%) students were at grade 1, 187 (62.1%) were at grade 2 and 74 (24.6%) were at grade 3. The "Cyber Bullying Question List" developed by Aricak (2009) was given to students. Following questions about demographics, a functional definition of cyber bullying was provided. In order to specify students' human values, "Human Values Scale (HVS)" developed by Dilmac (2007) for secondary school students was administered. The scale consists of 42 items in six dimensions. Data analysis was conducted by the primary investigator of the study using SPSS 14.00 statistical analysis software. Descriptive statistics were calculated for the analysis of students cyber bullying behaviour and simple regression analysis was conducted in order to test whether each value in the scale could explain cyber bullying behaviour.

AB  - An athlete's decision to use technology depends on trust in the automation, and confidence in their abilities. Distance measuring devices (DMD) are used in golf to estimate yardage. The purpose of these studies was to examine how DMD usage affects trust in the DMD, confidence in determining yardage manually, and golf performance over time. In study 1, DMD non-users played four rounds of golf, two with the DMD and two without. In study 2, DMD users played five rounds, three with the device, and two without. Participants' trust in automation, confidence, and performance were recorded by online survey at baseline and following each round. Giving a DMD to non-users influenced trust in automation and confidence. When DMD users relinquished the device, confidence decreased briefly but rebounded quickly, trust in automation was unaffected. Performance was unchanged in both groups. These studies provide information about how confidence in abilities and trust in automation interact.

AB  - Objective: JUUL-brand electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) contain higher levels of nicotine than other e-cigarettes. The current study examined the relationship between young adults’ self-reported addiction and measured JUUL dependence. Methods: This study used a sequential, explanatory mixed methods design. Data were collected from a large, southwestern college in the US. College students who were weekly JUUL users and owned a JUUL device (n = 595) completed a cross-sectional online survey, then a subsample (n = 51) participated in in-person interviews. All data were collected between March-April 2019. T-tests were used to examine differences between JUUL dependence and self-reported addiction, and logistic regressions were employed to examine factors that may influence self-reported addiction to JUUL, nicotine, and other e-cigarettes. Interviews were independently coded by 2 coders (kappa ranged from 0.46 to 0.99) then analyzed for corresponding themes. Results: Participants who had a higher JUUL dependence were more likely to report addiction to several substances/products, including nicotine, JUULs, cigarettes, other e-cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana. Interview participants minimized JUUL addiction by comparing JUUL to other socially acceptable addictions and describing JUUL addiction as a habit. Interview participants suggested addiction to nicotine was more stigmatizing than JUUL. The number of days participants used JUUL per week, use of traditional tobacco products, and measured JUUL dependence were each associated with self-reported JUUL addiction. Conclusions: Social construction of self-reported addictions may be changing young audiences’ views of addiction to JUUL. Research is needed to see if using the phrase ‘nicotine dependence’ rather than ‘JUUL addiction’ influences young adults’ JUUL use. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Emerging evidence from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain activation studies associated with dietary behavior reveals significant interaction of biological and behavioral mechanisms in response to visualized food stimuli. Because food intake is influenced by neurosensory stimulation and memory cues, personalized food images may be useful in prompting appropriate affective responses to food intake, which may subsequently lead to healthier eating behaviors. The current study used a cross-sectional mixed methods approach to explore neural responses and self-perceptions of eating behavior during review of personalized food images. A sample of college students (N = 16; 9 females; M age = 21.44) used cell-phone cameras and an online dietary tracking website to collect and report three days of diet. Within 2–3 weeks of completing dietary tracking activity, participants underwent an fMRI scan while reviewing recorded personal images and text descriptions of their diet. They also responded to three questions related to memory for the food items and future eating intentions. Post-scan interviews explored how participants felt after reviewing personal food images and the possible impact that such review might have on future food choices. Whole brain analyses suggested, compared to a written dietary record, that the visualization of personal images of diet evoked greater brain activation in memory regions (e.g., superior frontal gyrus) along with mediating emotion (e.g., thalamus, putamen, anterior cingulate cortex), imagery and executive functions (e.g., inferior orbitofrontal gyrus, fusiform, and parietal lobe). This study offers preliminary support for the use of personal food images to strengthen dietary monitoring. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Electronically assisted survey techniques offer several advantages over traditional survey techniques. However, they can also potentially introduce biases, such as coverage biases and measurement error. The current study compares the relative merits of two survey distribution and completion modes: email recruitment with internet completion; and door to door recruitment with either tablet or internet completion. Presentation mode is held constant so that we are able to separate the impacts of recruitment mode and completion mode on responses. Recruitment mode appeared to influence both response rates and which socio-demographic groups were represented. However, the difference between the two recruitment modes was relatively small. Completion mode appeared to have little or no impact on responses although it did influence completion times. The email distributed survey performed better with regard to time costs and the number of respondents obtained. Differences between the two survey modes appeared to be largely due to recruitment method rather than completion mode.

AB  - This paper reports on a study of students choosing the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma over state-based curricula in Australian schools. The IB Diploma was initially designed as a matriculation certificate to facilitate international mobility. While first envisaged as a lifestyle agenda for cultural elites, such mobility is now widespread with more people living ‘beyond the nation’ through choice or circumstance. Beck and others highlight how the capacity to cross national borders offers a competitive edge with which to strategically pursue economic and cultural capital. Beck’s ‘border artistes’ are those who use national borders to their individual advantage through reflexive strategy. The study explored the rationales and strategy behind the choice of the IB Diploma curriculum expressed by students in a focus group interview and an online survey. This paper reports on their imagined transnational routes and mobile orientations, and how a localised curriculum limits their imagined mobile futures.

AB  - Objective To describe the creation and evaluate the usage of the first medical wiki linked to dedicated mobile applications.Methods With the support of multiple current and past contributors, we developed an emergency medicine wiki linked to offline mobile applications (WikEM) in 2009. First deployment was at the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center emergency medicine residency program, with the wiki later opened to public use. To evaluate the project, we performed a post hoc analysis of system use and surveyed 8 years of current and past residents. Outcomes included website and application analytics, as well as survey analysis by composite response categories.Results Over the 6-year period of this project, the wiki grew to over 7250 pages and 45 500 edits. The website receives more than 85 000 user sessions per month, with over 150 million page views to date. There have been over 200 000 installs of the mobile applications, progressing to produce over 5000 mobile sessions daily. Of potential survey respondents, 87.7% (107) completed the Internet-based survey. Among those who contributed to the wiki, 74.6% reported that it benefited their understanding of core emergency medicine content. Of program graduates, the vast majority reported use of the wiki as a resource after residency (93.8%) along with improvement in clinical efficiency (89.7%). Residents reported higher use and a more favorable opinion of wiki usefulness compared to graduates (P < .001).Conclusions A wiki paired with mobile applications is beneficial for resident education and useful in post-residency clinical practice.

AB  - With the introduction of new depth-sensing technologies, interactive hand-gesture devices (such as smart televisions and displays) have been rapidly emerging. However, given the lack of a common vocabulary, most hand-gesture control commands are device-specific, burdening the user into learning different vocabularies for different devices. In order for hand gestures to become a natural communication for users with interactive devices, a standardized interactive hand-gesture vocabulary is necessary. Recently, researchers have approached this issue by conducting studies that elicit gesture vocabularies based on users' preferences. Nonetheless, a universal vocabulary has yet to be proposed. In this paper, a thorough design methodology for achieving such a universal hand-gesture vocabulary is presented. The methodology is derived from the work of Wobbrock et al. and includes four steps: 1) a preliminary survey eliciting users' attitudes; 2) a broader user survey in order to construct the universal vocabulary via results of the preliminary survey; 3) an evaluation test to study the implementation of the vocabulary; and 4) a memory test to analyze the memorability of the vocabulary. The proposed vocabulary emerged from this methodology achieves an agreement score exceeding those of the existing studies. Moreover, the results of the memory test show that, within a 15-min training session, the average accuracy of the proposed vocabulary is 90.71%. Despite the size of the proposed gesture vocabulary being smaller than that of similar work, it shares the same functionality, is easier to remember and can be integrated with smart TVs, interactive digital displays, and so on.

AB  - Background: The advent of Internet-based self-help systems for common mental disorders has generated a need for quick ways to triage would-be users to systems appropriate for their disorders. This need can be met by using brief online screening questionnaires, which can also be quickly used to screen patients prior to consultation with a GP. Objective: To test and enhance the validity of the Web Screening Questionnaire (WSQ) to screen for: depressive disorder, alcohol abuse/dependence, GAD, PTSD, social phobia, panic disorder, agoraphobia, specific phobia, and OCD. Methods: A total of 502 subjects (aged 18-80) answered the WSQ and 9 other questionnaires on the Internet. Of these 502, 157 were assessed for DSM-IV-disorders by phone in a WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview with a CIDI-trained interviewer. Results: Positive WSQ 'diagnosis' had significantly (P < .001) higher means on the corresponding validating questionnaire than negative WSQ 'diagnosis'. WSQ sensitivity was 0.72-1.00 and specificity was 0.44-0.77 after replacing three items (GAD, OCD, and panic) and adding one question for specific phobia. The Areas Under the Curve (AUCs) of the WSQ’s items with scaled responses were comparable to AUCs of longer questionnaires. Conclusions: The WSQ screens appropriately for common mental disorders. While the WSQ screens out negatives well, it also yields a high number of false positives. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - An online survey was conducted to investigate the likelihood of usage of the smartphone Voice Activated Personal Assistant (VAPA) such as Apple's Siri (compared to the usage of smartphone keyboard) as a function of location (private versus public) and type of information (private versus non-private) to inform design decisions to make the private use of the VAPA in public spaces more acceptable from the user point of view. Responses from 76 participants showed that users were more cautious of transmitting private than non-private information. This effect of type of information was amplified in the social context of public locations and when using conspicuous methods of information input such as the VAPA. Participants also preferred using the VAPA in private locations and showed no preference of location for keyboard entries. Correlations between likelihood of usage of VAPA and the social acceptability ratings were positive and predicted similar patterns of smartphone usage.

AB  - With the increasing rate and catastrophic consequences of phishing attacks, research on antiphishing solutions has gained growing importance in information security. Security risks may include information leakage, identity theft, financial loss and reputation sabotage. Raising human awareness is not a sufficient mitigation method and deploying complementary technical solutions is a crucial requirement. Although various approaches have been proposed in the literature, the design of efficient phishing detection models is a challenging task and the problem still lacks a complete solution. In this paper, we present a novel approach for detecting phishing websites based on probabilistic neural networks (PNNs). We also investigate the integration of PNN with K-medoids clustering to significantly reduce complexity without jeopardizing the detection accuracy. To assess the feasibility of the proposed approach, we conducted in-depth study to evaluate various performance measures on a publicly available data set composed of 11 055 phishing and benign websites. The experimental results show that more accurate models can be built and even with > 40% reduction in the complexity, > 97% accuracy can be achieved with low false errors.

AB  - We explore the relationship between exclusivity and state-contingent control rights using a sample of over 100 Internet portal alliance contracts. We find that stronger exclusivity arrangements are associated with more frequent usage of contingent control rights. For both portals and their partners, the more exclusively bound one party is, the more likely its counterparty is to be granted contingent control rights. Additionally, we find that portals' alliance partners are more likely to receive contingent control rights when they are prohibited from doing business with other portals and that contingent control rights are less likely to appear as the industry matures. Our findings are consistent with theoretical explanations that exclusivity provisions and contingent control rights both provide incentives to invest in the face of potential holdup problems and also with the proposition that exclusive arrangements lead firms to seek contingent control rights to avoid lock-in when environmental uncertainty is high. © 2009 The Author.

AB  - Introduction: Recently studies examined mediating psychological constructs accounting for relations between both depression and anxiety with problematic smartphone use (PSU) severity. The aim of the current study was to analyze the fear of missing out (FOMO) as a possible mediator in these relationships.
Method: We recruited 1034 Chinese undergraduate students via a web-based survey that measured smartphone use frequency, PSU, depression, anxiety and FOMO.
Results: Structural equation modeling demonstrated that FOMO was significantly related to smartphone use frequency and PSU severity. FOMO significantly mediated relations between anxiety and both smartphone use frequency and PSU severity. FOMO did not account for relations between depression and smartphone use/PSU.
Conclusion: This is one of the first studies testing FOMO in relation to PSU severity among Asian participants. FOMO may be an important variable accounting for why some types of psychopathology (e.g., anxiety) are associated with PSU.

AB  - The over usage and over dependency on digital devices, like smartphones, has been considered as a growing international epidemic. The increased dependency on gadgets, especially smartphones for personal and official uses, has also brought many detrimental effects on individual users. Hence it is vital to understand the negative effects of smartphone usage on human. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effects of bedtime smartphone usage on work performances, interpersonal conflicts, and work engagement, via the mediating role of sleep quality among employees. Using a cross-sectional study design, a questionnaire-based field survey was conducted on 315 employees who participated as respondents. The results confirmed the negative effects of bedtime smartphone usage on sleep quality. Along with it, the effects of sleep quality on work performances, work engagements and interpersonal conflicts were also proven to be statistically significant. Regarding the mediating role of sleep quality, it was empirically evident that sleep quality mediates the relationship between bedtime smartphone usage with work performances and interpersonal conflicts. The findings revealed that bedtime smartphone usage reduces sleep quality among the employees, resulting in lower work performances and engagements while contributing to higher interpersonal conflicts. The findings concluded that smartphone usage before sleep increases the prospects of employees to be less productive, less engaged, and have more workplace conflicts. The findings warrant the continued managerial as well as academic research attention, as the smartphones are now used by many organisations to run businesses as well.

AB  - The HCAHPS Survey obtains hospital patients’ experiences using four modes: Mail Only, Phone Only, Mixed (mail/phone follow-up), and Touch-Tone (push-button) Interactive Voice Response with option to transfer to live interviewer (TT-IVR/Phone). A new randomized experiment examines two less expensive modes: Web/Mail (mail invitation to participate by Web or request a mail survey) and Speech-Enabled IVR (SE-IVR/Phone; speaking to a voice recognition system; optional transfer to an interviewer). Web/Mail had a 12% response rate (vs. 32% for Mail Only and 33% for SE-IVR/Phone); Web/Mail respondents were more educated and less often Black than Mail Only respondents. SE-IVR/Phone respondents (who usually switched to an interviewer) were less often older than 75 years, more often English-preferring, and reported better care than Mail Only respondents. Concerns regarding inconsistencies across implementations, low adherence to primary modes, or low response rate may limit the applicability of the SE-IVR/Phone and Web/Mail modes in HCAHPS and similar standardized environments.

AB  - Recent research has attempted to describe meaningful experiences with entertainment media that go beyond hedonic enjoyment. Most of this research focuses on noninteractive media, such as film and television. When applied to digital games, however, such research needs to account for not only the content of the medium, but also the unique dimensions of digital games that distinguish them from noninteractive media. Experiences with digital games are shaped by the game mechanics that define the users' interaction with game content, as well as by the opportunities for social interaction that many games offer. We argue that the complex interplay of these dimensions (narrative, mechanics, and context) facilitates or inhibits meaningful user experiences in ways that are unique to digital games. © 2014 International Communication Association.

AB  - There is a common perception that ?every refugee carries a smartphone?, but research on this phenomenon is limited. We conducted a representative survey of 400 refugees to Germany which provides insight into their use of digital media in preparation for and during forced migration. We also asked whether digital media shaped images of and expectations about the refugees? target country Germany. The data show that refugees are not a homogeneous group and that usage patterns depend on regional origins. Internet use also contributed to a positively biased perception of Germany, but the effect of traditional media use was stronger.

AB  - In this paper we examine the problems of usability and related temporal issues in shared virtual environments. Shared virtual environments involve physically distributed users interacting with each other and with distributed objects via complex highly graphical user interfaces. These factors can result in interaction which suffers from serious and unpredictable delays in system response times. Careful interaction design can alleviate the problems resulting from such delays. We look at several areas of shared virtual world design, including object interaction, avatars and scene rendering, investigating ways of dealing with communicating information, preserving world coherence and providing users with effective real-time interaction. Our medium of analysis is the Extended User Action Notation (XUAN), a variant of the User Action Notation that enables us to express explicitly and clearly the temporal features of our examples. Finally, we discuss the implications of our temporal analysis for further research and development of shared virtual worlds, and the implications for the further development and use of XUAN.

AB  - Introduction: International mobility of researchers has always been a characteristic of academia. However, it became more intense in recent years. While long stays abroad are strongly promoted, their personal impact has only been rarely assessed. Objective: The aim of this study is to establish to what extent a long stay abroad influences work engagement, well-being feeling, affective organizational commitment and attitude towards future international mobility. Method: Participants included 188 researchers who responded to an online survey. Results: Results indicate that work engagement and well-being increase when the international mobility is perceived as successful. Analyzes also show that mobility perceived as voluntary and successful positively predicts favorable attitude towards future international mobility. In addition to these results, descriptive statistics report that men are more inclined to be mobile than women. Conclusion: The positive effects of the international mobility are discussed as well as its perverse effects. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Abstract Grammatical information, embedded at the word level, makes the acquisition of morphologically rich languages quite complex as well as the language exercise generation process for teachers. This study introduces a new gamification approach for complex morphology learning and aims to analyze the students’ perceptions towards it. In this approach, the morphology components and their interactions are gradually introduced to the learners within a gamified environment through automatically generated exercises. Although not specific to any language, the approach has been applied to Turkish which is a strong representative of morphologically rich languages. The study was conducted for three weeks with international students in an introductory level Turkish language course via a mobile application developed using finite-state transducer technology to model morphology. Questionnaires, e-journals and semi-structured interviews were employed to examine the perceptions and experiences of the students in terms of perceived efficacy, system usage, engagement, loyalty, perceived enjoyment, attitude, and willingness to recommend. The findings of the study revealed that the students had positive perceptions towards the proposed approach and found it effective for their learning process. The approach is considered to fill an important gap in grammar exercises for learning morphologically rich languages.

AB  - User-centered design (UCD) practitioners in industrial context are often faced with multilevel factors that hinder their effort to involve users in the context of use, and so meet one of the core UCD principles. Seen the heterogeneous and dynamic context of mobile system use, applying this principle becomes more challenging. Based on in-depth interviews with various mobile practitioners in Finland and the Netherlands, we explore the core factors that affect UCD practitioners in meeting this challenge. Our findings confirm the impact of the professional-client relationship as a key factor that inhibits the involvement of users. Novelty aspects, e.g. practitioners' unfamiliarity with the users and the perceived innovativeness of the designed system, largely explain the involvement of users in situ. Interestingly, these conditions are not idiosyncratic to mobile computing. We discuss the contextual factors' implications on UCD and emphasize alternative strategies that support practitioners in their effort to involve users.

AB  - In this article, we explore the online multiobject k‐coverage problem in visual sensor networks. This problem combines k‐coverage and the cooperative multirobot observation of multiple moving targets problem, and thereby captures key features of rapidly deployed camera networks, including redundancy and team‐based tracking of evasive or unpredictable targets. The benefits of using mobile cameras are demonstrated and we explore the balance of autonomy between cameras generating new subgoals, and those responders able to fulfill them. We show that higher performance against global goals is achieved when decisions are delegated to potential responders who treat subgoals as optional, rather than as obligations that override existing goals without question. This is because responders have up‐to‐date knowledge of their own state and progress toward goals where they are situated, which is typically old or incomplete at locations remote from them. Examining the extent to which approaches overprovision or underprovision coverage, we find that being well suited for achieving 1‐coverage does not imply good performance at k‐coverage. Depending on the structure of the environment, the problems of 1‐coverage and k‐coverage are not necessarily aligned and that there is often a trade‐off to be made between standard coverage maximization and achieving k‐coverage.

AB  - Many psychological processes unfold over time, necessitating longitudinal research designs. Longitudinal research poses a host of methodological challenges, foremost of which is participant attrition. Building on Dillman?s work, we provide a review of how social influence and relationship research informs retention strategies in longitudinal studies. Objective: We introduce the tailored panel management (TPM) approach, which is designed to establish communal norms that increase commitment to a longitudinal study, and this commitment, in turn, increases response rates and buffers against attrition. Specifically, we discuss practices regarding compensation, communication, consistency, and credibility that increase longer term commitment to panel participation. Research design: Throughout the article, we describe how TPM is being used in a national longitudinal study of undergraduate minority science students. TheScienceStudy is a continuing panel, which has 12 waves of data collected across 6 academic years, with response rates ranging from 70% to 92%. Although more than 90% of participants have either left or graduated from their undergraduate degree program, this highly mobile group of people remains engaged in the study. TheScienceStudy has usable longitudinal data from 96% of the original panel. Conclusion: This article combines social psychological theory, current best practice, and a detailed case study to illustrate the TPM approach to longitudinal data collection. The approach provides guidance for other longitudinal researchers, and advocates for empirical research into longitudinal research methodologies.

AB  - Digital mobile devices such as iPads have been around for many years and have been more and more popular in K-12 classrooms. Research has pointed out the advantages of using iPads in classrooms to enhance teaching, engage learning, and promote learning outcomes. iPads have been proven to be a useful and powerful digital mobile device in language learning including speaking, listening, reading, and writing. The purpose of the study was to investigate whether a technology integrated twenty-first century writing workshop had an influence on the ability and attitude towards writing in Chinese for second graders enrolled in the Mandarin Chinese program in a language immersion elementary school. Twenty-four students participated in the study. Recording technology (iPad recording app), an iPad camera, and the Book Creator App were integrated into the twenty-first century writing workshop. A pre-survey, post-survey, and observation were used to collect data. The results of the study confirmed that writing barriers decreased when the Chinese immersion program students utilized iPads in the writing workshop. Also, the writing ability and attitudes of the Chinese immersion program students improved after the completion of their twenty-first century writing workshop.

AB  - The potential of the Internet to act as a global distribution outlet for screen content has long come into conflict with the nationally focused strategies of producers, broadcasters, governments and Internet service providers. Online viewing therefore acts as a useful case study for interrogating how tensions between `global' and `local' manifest within an increasingly digitized media landscape. This article examines the online viewing markets in three countries at different stages of digital maturity (South Korea, Brazil and India) to consider how online viewing has evolved in each. It then examines audience questionnaire and interview data generated in each country to explore how viewers are making sense of and valuing online viewing services. By interrogating all three samples before focusing specifically on India in more detail, it examines two tensions within the global expansion of online film and television distribution: between global trends and local infrastructures and between the ideals of online viewing services and the grounded realities of their daily use.

AB  - Purpose Using upper echelons theory (UET), the purpose of this paper is to unravel the influence of a CEO's ethical ideology on the presence of corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure on corporate websites. It also considers the CEO's perception of the importance of CSR (i.e. the extent of the CEO's detachment from the stockholder-oriented logic and attachment to the stakeholder-oriented logic).
Design/methodology/approach First, a survey was sent to CEOs of large unlisted Belgian companies. Its intention was to assess CEOs' ethical ideology along the idealism and relativism dimensions and their perceptions on the importance of CSR (PRESOR-detachment-from-stockholder view; PRESOR-attachment-to-stakeholder view), and to gather some demographics. Second, a content analysis of corporate websites was conducted so as to classify companies as being either CSR disclosing or non-disclosing. Third, the annual accounts of these corporations were investigated and follow-up phone calls were conducted to obtain data on managerial discretion (MD).
Findings CEOs' ethical ideology influences the degree to which they detach from the stockholder-oriented logic and attach to the stakeholder-oriented logic. Moreover, when MD is high, the degree of these CEOs' attachment to the stakeholder-oriented logic is the factor that influences the presence of CSR disclosure on their corporate websites. Finally, CEO's idealism indirectly influences the presence of CSR disclosure through the effect of idealism on the degree to which CEOs attach to the stakeholder-oriented logic.
Originality/value This paper shows that, when MD is high, CEOs' values and perceptions influence CSR disclosure decisions. This study thereby enhances our knowledge regarding the internal drivers of CSR disclosure practices and offers UET as a lens through which the importance of CEOs' personal characteristics in the decision-making process might be further explored.

AB  - To explore socially desirable responding in telephone surveys, this study examines response latencies in answers to 27 questions in a corpus of 319 audio-recorded voice interviews on iPhones. Response latencies were compared when respondents (a) answered questions on sensitive vs. nonsensitive topics (as classified by online raters); (b) produced more vs. less socially desirable answers; and (c) were interviewed by a professional interviewer or an automated system. Respondents answered questions on sensitive topics more quickly than on nonsensitive topics, though patterns varied by question format (categorical, numerical, ordinal). Independent of question sensitivity, respondents gave less socially desirable answers more quickly when answering categorical and ordinal questions but more slowly when answering numeric questions. Respondents were particularly quicker to answer sensitive questions when asked by interviewers than by the automated system. Findings demonstrate that response times can be (differently) revealing about question and response sensitivity in a telephone survey.

AB  - The pursuit of beautiful appearance for human greatly inspires the studies on digital beautifiers especially for the popularity of social networking services (SNS) in this booming era of mobile phones. Unfortunately, existing beautification techniques are not efficient enough for mobile devices that have limited computation and storage resources. In this paper, we propose a beautifier that is efficient on both space and time, and develop a mobile APP available online. We focus on the local beautification of facial chin that has a great effect on facial attractiveness, and simply use an averaged chin shape as the template. We leverage Laplacian as the constraint to remap the original shape to the target, and recursively apply the Laplacian constraint to the contour points from the coarse to fine scales. Thus, we only need to inverse a small matrix for the remap, which requires quite low expenses on space and time. Finally, we apply an efficient warping algorithm based on triangular meshes to generate a beautified face image. The performance of the algorithm is validated by a survey on 70 facial images since no objective metric for beauty exists. Twenty volunteers are invited to grade the results labeled as ‘worse’, ‘unchanged’ and ‘better’. The results show that 81.50% of inputs are believed becoming more beautiful, and another 10.07% of them are considered unchanged. We also provide the comparisons on the beautification quality and time expenses with the algorithm based on radial basis functions (RBF). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study investigates the effect of gamified interaction through mobile learning applications (APPs) to optimise users' learning performance. This paper draws on social presence theory and social support theory to construct a model of gamified interaction. We conducted a survey questionnaire with a sample of 368 users from English learning APPs and used structural equation modelling to assess their learning performance. Our results reveal that not all dimensions of gamified interaction enhance learning performance directly. Some dimensions of gamified interaction can optimise users' social presence and perceived social support, which in turn, improve users' learning performance. In addition, learning style can influence users' sense of social presence and perceived social support when they are facing the same gamified interactions. This study highlights the important determinants influencing users' learning performance in the context of gamified mobile learning by incorporating three overlooked factors, gamified interaction, users' learning experience and learning style. For managers of those learning APPs who want to attract more users it is advisable to carry out various gamified interactions through differentiated gamified tools based on users' learning style, which can meet users' psychological needs and thereby enhance effective learning experience.

AB  - This study takes place from the idea that the personal usage of mobile technologies can bring positive outcomes to the user and to their society in an indirect way. Technologies studied in this work are defined as persuasive technologies (Fogg, 1997) because they are intentionally designed to modify the users’ attitude or behavior. This research is aimed to evaluate if the intention to use the application can be influenced by positive attitudes toward technology, by the persuasive power of the application and by the perceived fun. Participants (N = 118; M = 55; F = 63; mean age = 27.4; range age = 15–69) filled in an online questionnaire that was partly based on the Media and Technology Usage and Attitude Scale (MTUAS—Rosen et al., 2013). An additional eight items were added to the scale, aimed at evaluating participants’ technophobia, technophilia, perceived technology pervasiveness and perceived persuasive power of technology. By using linear regression analysis, it was found that the application’s informational power and the perceived entertainment positively influenced the usage intention. Another interesting result, obtained through ANOVA, concerns a generational difference: baby boomers tended to trust more the fact that the single individual action through the application can have an effective impact on the environment. These results represent a basis for future in-depth investigations about socially relevant use of the ICT. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Depression occurring during pregnancy and postpartum (i.e., the perinatal period) is common and associated with adverse outcomes for women and their offspring. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) has been shown to reduce risk for depressive relapse among at-risk individuals generally, and recent adaptations document the efficacy of MBCT among perinatal women specifically. In addition, MBCT, when delivered using a web-based format (Mindful Mood Balance [MMB] program), has demonstrated acceptability and feasibility for at-risk individuals generally. The aim of the present open trial study was to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary outcomes of MMB for use with pregnant women at risk for depressive relapse (N = 37). We predicted that MMB would be feasible and acceptable as assessed by session completion and participation in phone coaching calls, home practice completion, and self-reported satisfaction via questionnaire and interview. We also predicted that women would not demonstrate significant worsening of depression symptom severity during MMB, consistent with our focus on prevention. A brief case example based on a composite of participants is presented to illustrate the MMB structure and content and the phone coaching protocol. Participants demonstrated engagement with the program, reported perceiving benefits in the intended depression prevention targets of MMB, and sustained minimal to mild depressive symptom severity over the course of the program. Given these promising results and the potential benefits of averting depression for women and their families, further development and rigorous testing of MMB among at-risk pregnant women is warranted.

AB  - Hajj, the annual pilgrimage to Makkah, is one of the most massive gathering events in the world. It is a mandatory religious activity, once in a lifetime for every sane well-off Muslim. Every year around 3 million Muslims across the globe visit Makkah to perform this spatiotemporally constrained set of religious activities, like circumambulation around the Kaaba and the encampment at Mina, Arafat and Muzdalifah. The key ritual at Rami-al-Jamarat (the stoning-of-the-pillars) is a place seen particularly crowded. The diversified nature of the crowd in terms of race, age, language and culture brings several administrative challenges for local organizers whose responsibility is to ensure the smooth organization of the event. The advent of digital technologies has helped researchers to explore and propose modern methods for better crowd management and devise control strategies to organize such a mass gathering. In this paper, we present a taxonomy that summarizes our survey on the utilization of technology areas for providing needful services and improving crowd management during the Hajj season. These technologies are Wireless, Computer Vision, Spatial Computing, Data Analytics, Mobile Applications, Immersive Technologies, and Crowd Modelling and Simulation. We have also included the current research work and its implementation plan for Hajj 2020. One dimension of the taxonomy is to understand different possible technologies for Crowd management. Another dimension is to understand the impact of technologies to handle such a massive crowd. The discussion section covers a comparison of technologies with multiple aspects that may help researchers to contribute more towards dealing with future mass gathering events.

AB  - Despite the importance of conducting systematic literature reviews (SLRs) for identifying the research gaps in software engineering (SE) research, SLRs are a complex, multi-stage, and time-consuming process if performed manually. Conducting an SLR in line with the guidelines and practice in the SE domain requires considerable effort and expertise. The objective of this SLR is to identify and classify text-mining techniques and tools that can help facilitate SLR activities. This study also investigates the adoption of text-mining (TM) techniques to support SLR in the SE domain. We performed a mixed search strategy to identify relevant studies published from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2016. We shortlisted 32 papers into the final set of relevant studies published in the SE, medicine and social science disciplines. The majority of the text-mining techniques attempted to support the study selection stage. Only 12 out of the 14 studies in the SE domain applied text-mining techniques, focusing primarily on facilitating the search and study selection stages. By learning from the experience of applying TM techniques in clinical medicine and social science fields, we believe that SE researchers can adopt appropriate SLR automation strategies for use in the SE field.

AB  - Clicker training is an animal training technique derived from mechanized laboratory-based studies of animal learning. However, clicker training in the real world often takes place with a human trainer in an environment that is not as well controlled as a laboratory. Attempts to empirically evaluate applied clicker training techniques using testing protocols adapted from laboratory-based studies have been largely unsuccessful in replicating the learning benefits seen in laboratory animals. One proposed explanation for these inconsistencies is that methods used in the scientific evaluation of clicker training, and methods used by trainers in the industry, are not the same. The purpose of the present study was to determine what clicker training is, why people use it, and what methods are considered best practice in the context of applied dog training. A total of 586 dog owners and dog training professionals completed an online questionnaire. The results suggest that individuals do neither restrict the definition of clicker training with training using a clicker device but also include alternative signals such as verbal markers. Overall, individuals reported that clicker training was successful but acknowledged that certain handler skills need to be mastered before a person should begin clicker training with a dog. Survey respondents also showed substantial methodological variety in how they believed clickers should ideally be used. Systematic investigation into these methodological differences, along with empirical assessment of purported benefits, is now required so that evidence-based best practice recommendations in clicker training can be developed. Closer alignment between scientists and practitioners is likely to benefit both groups and the many animals that are currently trained for companion and working roles.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the role of mobile-based student response systems in teaching to improve university students' academic outcomes. Mobile devices can be useful tools for conveying content to large classes, with a potential impact on academic outcomes. This study involved a total of 294 undergraduates taking a psychology course. The course involved lessons in the classroom, which included answering quizzes (quiz activities) and activities such as preparing reports and laboratory experiences (out-of-class activities). Quizzes were administered using a mobile technology system. Data were collected on the motivational beliefs (theory of intelligence) and self-regulated learning strategies of students who voluntarily completed the online questionnaires. The results of the linear models showed that using the quizzes positively affected the performance in the final exams (involving closed and open questions). The same was true for the out-of-class activities. The motivation and strategy scores correlated moderately with out-of-class activities, but not with quiz activities. These results offer insight on the use of technology during lessons and other course-related activities to promote academic achievement.

AB  - Digital media, especially mobile communication technologies, enable adolescents to explore and experiment with each other with only limited adult control. Conflicts between peers can be easily staged since nearly everybody can be reached at any time under the radar of authorities. Therefore, involvement in conflicts and bullying might depend on how adolescents use and behave online. In the present study, we provide a comprehensive picture of the role aspects of online communication play in long-term involvement in cyberbullying. We focused on a gender-specific perspective, as girls and boys were found to differ not only according to their online communication but also in their cyberbullying involvement. Using a two-wave panel survey of 1817 adolescents between 13 and 17 years (56 % female), we found that girls' cyberbullying involvement (perpetration and victimization) could be traced back to more intensive online social activities and a higher amount of online contact with strangers. In contrast, for boys, only higher exposure to antisocial media content predicted higher levels of victimization over time. The findings indicate that certain patterns of online communication increase the cyberbullying risk over time. However, it needs to be noted that these risk factors vary between girls and boys.

AB  - Background: The German Shepherd Dog (GSD) is one of the most common breeds on earth and has been bred for its utility and intelligence. It is often first choice for police and military work, as well as protection, disability assistance, and search-and-rescue. Yet, GSDs are well known to be susceptible to a range of genetic diseases that can interfere with their training. Such diseases are of particular concern when they occur later in life, and fully trained animals are not able to continue their duties. Findings: Here, we provide the draft genome sequence of a healthy German Shepherd female as a reference for future disease and evolutionary studies. We generated this improved canid reference genome (CanFam-GSD) utilizing a combination of Pacific Bioscience, Oxford Nanopore, 10X Genomics, Bionano, and Hi-C technologies. The GSD assembly is ∼80 times as contiguous as the current canid reference genome (20.9 vs 0.267 Mb contig N50), containing far fewer gaps (306 vs 23,876) and fewer scaffolds (429 vs 3,310) than the current canid reference genome CanFamv3.1. Two chromosomes (4 and 35) are assembled into single scaffolds with no gaps. BUSCO analyses of the genome assembly results show that 93.0% of the conserved single-copy genes are complete in the GSD assembly compared with 92.2% for CanFam v3.1. Homology-based gene annotation increases this value to ∼99%. Detailed examination of the evolutionarily important pancreatic amylase region reveals that there are most likely 7 copies of the gene, indicative of a duplication of 4 ancestral copies and the disruption of 1 copy. Conclusions: GSD genome assembly and annotation were produced with major improvement in completeness, continuity, and quality over the existing canid reference. This resource will enable further research related to canine diseases, the evolutionary relationships of canids, and other aspects of canid biology.

AB  - Graphical interface use involves schemata operations that range from transfer to induction. The former apply existing knowledge, such as prior schemata, and are effortless, preconscious and intuitive. The latter, which consist in constructing new schemata, are resource-consuming and thus detrimental to intuitive use (IU). A quantitative method is proposed to manipulate and screen schemata operations at the level of an interface's states and features. Relevance for the design cycle of innovative interfaces is critically reviewed, and integration with existing intuitive-use design frameworks is proposed. These considerations are built upon instructional design studies suggesting that assessment should precede and inform the application of design techniques geared toward IU.

AB  - Mode effects on responses to survey items may introduce bias to data collected using multiple modes of administration. The present study examines data from 704 surveys conducted as part of a longitudinal study in which parents and their children had been surveyed at multiple prior time points. Parents of 22-year-old study participants were randomly assigned to one of two mixed-mode conditions: (1) web mode first followed by the offer of an interviewer-administered telephone mode; or (2) telephone mode first followed by the offer of the web mode. Comparison of responses by assigned condition on 12 measures showed one statistically significant difference. Analyses that modeled differences by completed mode and the interaction between assigned condition and completed mode found significant differences on six measures related to completed mode. None of the differences indicated that more socially desirable responses were given in interviewer-administered surveys.

AB  - Residential buildings account for a large proportion of our total energy consumption. Numerous studies have been conducted to assess the impact of different types of energy consumption feedback on customer behavior. However, an eco-feedback delivered on technological devices such as tablet or smartphone can only be effective if it is consulted by customers, and thus has to be well accepted and positively viewed by them. The aim of the present study was to compare levels of a priori acceptability across the most tested types of eco-feedback in the literature, namely informational (single number corresponding to the customer's energy consumption), temporal (allowing customers to compare their levels of consumption over time), normative (indicating customers' consumption relative to other people's mean consumption), temporal and normative (comparisons over time and in relation to other people), interpersonal (ranking of customers) and intergroup (ranking of groups). A priori acceptability of this feedback was assessed with a survey of 176 French people living in a mid-sized metropolitan area. Overall, intentions to use were quite high, even though participants were not in the habit of attending to feedback. Moreover, results revealed that the most acceptable types of feedback were temporal and normative, while intergroup and interpersonal types of feedback were the least acceptable.

AB  - Qualitative inquiry always used various kinds of data for understanding social issues and participants? perspectives. Research and methodologies were debated for what data are adequate for studying social justice issues. Current challenges for concepts of data are new, for example, virtual and digital data, question traditional data (interviews, ethnography, etc.) in their relevance for understanding current life worlds. New methods produce new and other forms of data (e.g., mobile, virtual data). Neoliberal contexts produce questions about qualitative research and its data. What is an adequate and contemporary understanding of the concept of ?data?? These questions are discussed in this special issue.

AB  - Different studies have evaluated the factors that lead to the adoption of new online services in general and particularly for Location-Based Services adoption (LBS), as this is seen as a key application for smart-phones. Recently, several security threats and the disclosure of extensive personal data have raised the question, if location data are considered as sensitive data by users. Thus, we use two privacy concern models, namely Concern for Information Privacy (CFIP) and Internet Users' Information Privacy Concerns (IUIPC) to find out. Our sample comprises of 235 individuals between 18 and 34 years (Generation C) from Germany. The results of this study indicate that the second-order factor IUIPC showed better fit for the underlying data than CFIP did. Overall privacy concerns have been found to have an impact on behavioral intentions of users for LBS adoption. Furthermore, other risk dimensions may play a role in determining usage intention, which should be analyzed by further research. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study unveils the cognitive mechanism that locus of control (LOC) dimensions (internal control, chance control, and control by powerful others) predict intention to reuse mobile apps for making hotel reservations. The predictions are assumed through the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) anchors and perceived risk. Drawn from an online survey with 457 Chinese participants, results show direct positive predictions of intention to reuse from UTAUT anchors including performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions. Perceived risk also negatively predicts intention. Effort expectancy mediates the links between internal/chance control and intention, whereas perceived risk mediates only the latter link. Facilitating conditions mediate the relationship between control by powerful others and intention. This study contributes to existing research by distinguishing the mechanisms that underpin LOC dimensions and technology re-adoption. Practitioners are recommended to improve booking apps by addressing the concerns of users with different LOC. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Longitudinal or panel surveys offer unique benefits for social science research, but they typically suffer from attrition, which reduces sample size and can result in biased inferences. Previous research tends to focus on the demographic predictors of attrition, conceptualizing attrition propensity as a stable, individual-level characteristic -- some individuals (e.g., young, poor, residentially mobile) are more likely to drop out of a study than others. We argue that panel attrition reflects both the characteristics of the individual respondent as well as her survey experience, a factor shaped by the design and implementation features of the study. In this article, we examine and compare the predictors of panel attrition in the 2008-2009 American National Election Study, an online panel, and the 2006-2010 General Social Survey, a face-to-face panel. In both cases, survey experience variables are predictive of panel attrition above and beyond the standard demographic predictors, but the particular measures of relevance differ across the two surveys. The findings inform statistical corrections for panel attrition bias and provide study design insights for future panel data collections.

AB  - Sample surveys are a valuable source of information about populations. The choice of data collection method depends upon the topic covered and the population observed, and the quality of data yielded may be affected by wide-ranging criteria, including sample representativeness, response rate, question comprehension and sincerity of responses. Survey methodology must therefore integrate constraints - which vary according to the data collection mode - while adapting constantly to make the most of available technology. Thirty years ago, postal surveys and face-to-face surveys conducted by an interviewer were joined by telephone surveys, whose advantages and disadvantages have been described in detail by Benoît Riandey and Jean-Marie Firdion in Population (1993, vol. 5). Since then, the growing problem of ex-directory numbers and the popularity of mobile phones have prompted the need for further adaptations. The increase in Internet access has led to the recent emergence of new survey methods, bringing in their wake new opportunities but also new dangers. Based on a review of the literature, Didier FRIPPIAT and Nicolas MARQUIS assess the strengths and weaknesses of this latest data collection mode. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Early theories of the internet imagined that individuals would begin living most of their lives online, decreasing the importance of physical mobility and urban spaces. With the development of internet-enabled mobile phones, these early predictions have been proven false. The internet has not decreased the importance of physical mobility; instead, the digital information of the internet has begun to merge with physical space, leading to new types of hybrid spaces. These hybrid spaces are becoming increasingly common, and they may change the way physical space is negotiated and understood. At this early juncture, however, it is crucial to critically examine the development of hybrid spaces and how they may lead to issues of exclusion and exacerbate issues of access. This essay takes a critical approach to the development of hybrid spaces, arguing that what is often lost in discourses about these new understandings of space are questions of who gets to experience this convergence of the digital and the physical.

AB  - It is certain that cloud users are eager to ascertain where their sensitive data are stored. Misplacing the data probably divulges secret information. Therefore, researchers have designed mechanisms of geolocation of cloud data to allow cloud users to get geolocation of cloud data. However, to seek an approach to seeing through frauds is still a challenge. Trusted computing technology offers an alternative. The current study endeavors to construct the method through combining the technology with established geolocation techniques of Internet hosts thoroughly. Our work is complementary to Gondree and Peterson's recent contributions in which a constraint-based cloud data geolocation solution is present. The current scheme offers a strong validation of geolocation of cloud data, and can see through deceits. In the scheme, we leverage an un-clonable and tamper-proof device, Trusted Platform Module, which guarantees that cloud users can collect authentic geolocation evidences. We evaluate the original idea using a wide range of experiments. Results demonstrate that the scheme is feasible, and has a satisfactory performance in the city-level accuracy.

AB  - In recent years, mobile devices are increasingly considered to access the World Wide Web. Several survey research organizations are about to use this technology as a means of conducting self-administered surveys. Among other advantages it allows survey researchers to overcome the lack of random selection procedures in online surveys since it provides the opportunity to use RDD-like probability sampling of cell phone numbers. However, low penetration rates of smart phones raise concerns that the coverage bias of a mobile Web survey might in fact harm survey estimates considerably. In this paper, we report results of a simulation study on the coverage bias of the mobile Web population across European countries. Based on a subset of the Eurobarometer data we estimate the relative coverage bias of the smart phone population in contrast to the general population. Even though we observed an incline of the mobile Web penetration rates over the course of the past years, coverage biases were still considerably large for socio-demographic variables. Nevertheless, in a few European countries mobile Web coverage biases are already smaller than the coverage biases of the population with traditional landline Internet access.

AB  - Objective: The study sought to assess the feasibility of replacing the International Classification of Diseases-Tenth Revision-Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) with the International Classification of Diseases-11th Revision (ICD-11) for morbidity coding based on content analysis. Materials and Methods: The most frequently used ICD-10-CM codes from each chapter covering 60% of patients were identified from Medicare claims and hospital data. Each ICD-10-CM code was recoded in the ICD-11, using postcoordination (combination of codes) if necessary. Recoding was performed by 2 terminologists independently. Failure analysis was done for cases where full representation was not achieved even with postcoordination. After recoding, the coding guidance (inclusions, exclusions, and index) of the ICD-10-CM and ICD-11 codes were reviewed for conflict. Results: Overall, 23.5% of 943 codes could be fully represented by the ICD-11 without postcoordination. Postcoordination is the potential game changer. It supports the full representation of 8.6% of 943 codes. Moreover, with the addition of only 9 extension codes, postcoordination supports the full representation of 35.2% of 943 codes. Coding guidance review identified potential conflicts in 10% of codes, but mostly not affecting recoding. The majority of the conflicts resulted from differences in granularity and default coding assumptions between the ICD-11 and ICD-10-CM. Conclusions: With some minor enhancements to postcoordination, the ICD-11 can fully represent almost 60% of the most frequently used ICD-10-CM codes. Even without postcoordination, 23.5% full representation is comparable to the 24.3% of ICD-9-CM codes with exact match in the ICD-10-CM, so migrating from the ICD-10-CM to the ICD-11 is not necessarily more disruptive than from the International Classification of Diseases-Ninth Revision-Clinical Modification to the ICD-10-CM. Therefore, the ICD-11 (without a CM) should be considered as a candidate to replace the ICD-10-CM for morbidity coding.

AB  - This article shows how new forms of electronic products and services become economically feasible and thus candidates for commercialization and creative destruction as improvements in standard electronic components such as microprocessors, memory, and displays occur. Unlike the predominant viewpoint in which commercialization is reached, as advances in science facilitate design changes that enable improvements in performance and cost, most new forms of electronic products and services are not invented in a scientific sense, and the cost and performance of them are primarily driven by improvements in standard components. They become candidates for commercialization, as the cost and performance of standard components reach the levels necessary for the final products and services to have the required levels of performance and cost. This suggests that when managers, policy makers, engineers, and entrepreneurs consider the choice and timing of commercializing new electronic products and services, they should understand the composition of new technologies, the impact of components on a technology's cost, performance and design, and the rates of improvement in the components.

AB  - This article provides evidence that there is a substantial difference between slider scales and visual analogue scales (VAS), two types of rating scales used in web surveys that are frequently mixed up. In an experimental design, both scales were compared to standard HTML radio buttons and offered three, five, or seven response options. Slider scales negatively affect response rate (especially on mobile devices), the sample composition, the distribution of values, and also increase response times. VAS and radio buttons, however, can be used without negative side effects, even on touch screen devices like smartphones. Overall, it is recommended to avoid slider scales. As small differences in rating scales?here drag and drop versus point and click?have a huge influence on data collection, an optimal implementation of VAS is suggested. However, measurement of discrete variables with a moderate number of response options should be done with radio buttons scales unless a small screen size?for example, on smartphones?requires an economical use of space.

AB  - Concerns exist that Internet gambling may increase rates of gambling harms, yet research to date has found inconsistent results. Internet gamblers are a heterogeneous group and considering this population as a whole may miss important differences between gamblers. The differential relationship of using mobile and other devices for gambling online has not been considered as compared to the use of computers. The true relationship of Internet gambling on related problems and differences between preferred modes for accessing online gambling may be obscured by confounding personal and behavioural factors. This paper thus uses the innovative approach of propensity score matching to estimate the consequence of gambling offline, or online through a computer, as compared to mobile or other supplementary devices by accounting for confounding effects of difference among groups of Australian gamblers (N = 4482). Gamblers who prefer to gamble online using computers had lower rates of gambling problems as compared to those using mobile and supplementary devices. Individual life cycle was useful to differentiate between groups, indicating age, marital, and employment status should be considered together to predict how people gamble online. This is the first empirical study to suggest that the mode of accessing Internet gambling may be related to subsequent harms. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study explores mobile phone use among people experiencing homelessness in downtown Los Angeles. It explores usage patterns and connectivity challenges, and how these affect access to social services as well as opportunities for information seeking, skills building, and social capital formation. To characterize the unreliable conditions under which this population uses mobile phones, we introduce the concept of access instability to capture not simply the obstacles to technology access imposed by poverty but more broadly those stemming from a combination of poverty, housing insecurity, and discrimination. The study is primarily based on a survey among adults experiencing homelessness (or at risk of) conducted over a span of 5 months, complemented by findings from a participatory research intervention carried out in collaboration with a local advocacy organization. Among the key findings is that reliable access to electrical power represents a fundamental yet understudied barrier to mobile use among marginalized populations, including (but not limited to) those experiencing homelessness. Lacking a safe and reliable place to charge their devices, the unstably housed must activate coping strategies that limit digital engagement and constrain use. Overall, access instability disrupts the expectation of constant reachability that underpins modern economic and social relations. Ultimately, this narrows pathways out of homelessness by limiting the ability to gain or sustain employment, to connect with healthcare providers and other vital resources, and to maintain networks of personal support.

AB  - Cells are powered by a large set of macromolecular complexes, which work together in a crowded environment. The in situ mechanisms of these complexes are unclear because their 3D distribution, organization, and interactions are largely unknown. Electron cryotomography (cryo-ET) can address these knowledge gaps because it produces cryotomograms - 3D images that reveal biological structure at ∼4-nm resolution. Cryo-ET uses no fixation, dehydration, staining, or plastic embedment, so cellular features are visualized in a life-like, frozen-hydrated state. To study chromatin and mitotic machinery in situ, we subjected yeast cells to genetic and chemical perturbations, cryosectioned them, and then imaged the cells by cryo-ET. Findings: Here we share >1,000 cryo-ET raw datasets of cryosectioned budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiaecollected as part of previously published studies. These data will be valuable to cell biologists who are interested in the nanoscale organization of yeasts and of eukaryotic cells in general. All the unpublished tilt series and a subset of corresponding cryotomograms have been deposited in the EMPIAR resource for the community to use freely. To improve tilt series discoverability, we have uploaded metadata and preliminary notes to publicly accessible Google Sheets, EMPIAR, and GigaDB. Conclusions: Cellular cryo-ET data can be mined to obtain new cell-biological, structural, and 3D statistical insights in situ. These data contain structures not visible in traditional electron-microscopy data. Template matching and subtomogram averaging of known macromolecular complexes can reveal their 3D distributions and low-resolution structures. Furthermore, these data can serve as testbeds for high-throughput image-analysis pipelines, as training sets for feature-recognition software, for feasibility analysis when planning new structural-cell-biology projects, and as practice data for students.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of perceived benefits, i.e. utilitarian value, hedonic value and social value, as well as perceived risk, on purchase intention in social commerce context.
Design/methodology/approach - To cast light on the factors motivating users' intention to purchase in the context of social commerce, data of 277 users of social commerce in China were collected via an online survey.
Findings - Results show that satisfaction significantly and positively affects users' purchase intention in social commerce context. In addition, utilitarian, hedonic and social values have significant and positive impacts on satisfaction and purchase intention; and utilitarian value is found to be the most salient factor influencing purchase intention, while hedonic value has the greatest effect on satisfaction. Moreover, perceived risk significantly and negatively affects satisfaction.
Originality/value - Extant research on social commerce has mainly focused on investigating how the general perceived value affects user behavior, but has less considered different dimensions of perceived value. Moreover, prior studies have explored the roles of utilitarian and hedonic values on user behavior; however, there is a lack of research on the effect of social value. The current study attempts to fill these research gaps.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the continued usage of mobile instant messaging (IM) from the perspectives of both motivators and inhibitors.
Design/methodology/approach - To cast light on the motivators and inhibitors of continuance intention (CI) to use mobile IM, 268 responses from Chinese mobile IM users were collected via an online survey.
Findings - The results suggest that perceived system quality, procedural switching cost and relational switching cost (RSC) positively affect resistance to change (RTC), while perceived user base, perceived quality of communication, RSC and RTC positively affect the CI. Among them, RTC has the greatest effect on the CI, and RSC has the largest effect on RTC.
Originality/value - Extant research has mainly focussed on the motivators behind the continued usage of mobile services. However, the inhibitors, such as switching cost and RTC, have been less considered in the research on the continued usage of mobile services. Also, only a little research has examined the components of switching costs and how they affect the intention to continue using mobile services. The current study attempts to fill these research gaps.

AB  - Research problem: When dealing with procedural documents, individuals sometimes encounter comprehension problems due to poor information design. Researchers studying the use and understanding of procedural documents, as well as technical writers charged with the design of these documents, or usability specialists evaluating their quality, would all benefit from tools allowing them to collect real-time data concerning user behavior in user-centered studies. With this in mind, the generic software Technical Instructions Processing—Evaluations and experiments Editor (TIP-EXE) was designed to facilitate the carrying out of such studies. Research questions: Does document design, and specifically the matching or mismatching of the terms employed in a user manual and on the corresponding device, affect the cognitive processes involved in the comprehension of procedural instructions? Can we use a software tool like TIP-EXE to assess the impact of document design on the use and understanding of a procedural document? Literature review: A review of the methods employed to study either the use of procedural documents or their cognitive processing, and to evaluate the quality of these documents, revealed the lack of tools for collecting relevant data. Methodology: TIP-EXE software was used to set up and run a laboratory experiment designed to collect data concerning the effect of document design on the performance of a task. The experiment was conducted with 36 participants carrying out tasks involving the programming of a digital timer under one of three conditions: 'matching instructions,' 'mismatching instructions,''mismatching instructions + picture'. Based on a click-and-read method for blurred text, TIP-EXE was used to collect data on the time the users spent reading the instructions, as well as the time spent handling the timer. Results and discussion: Results show that 'matching instructions' (when the terms employed in the user manual match the terms on the device) enhance user performance. This instructional format results in less time spent consulting the instructions and handling the device, as well as fewer errors. This research shows that TIP-EXE software can be used to study the way in which operating instructions are read, and the time spent consulting specific information contained therein, thereby revealing the effects of document design on user behavior.

AB  - Chronic stress in young adults has become a growing problem within recent decades and many are unable to find cost-effective and accessible treatment for psychological stress in their daily lives. We analyze the market of using a mobile application, Positive Technology, as a solution. Eleven participants, aged between 18 and 24, participated in the exercise. Self-reported stress reduction was measured via an online marketing survey, while physiological measurements were monitored via peripheral devices. Secondary goals assessed the app’s ease-of-use, accessibility, and cost. Results indicate that participants enjoyed the availability of the mobile solution and found the app to be fun and easy to learn. Stress levels were reduced in 73% of the participants, with higher effects in females and in participants aged 18-24. We conclude that the mobile platform is an effective means of delivering psychological stress reduction, and could provide an accessible, cost-effective solution.

AB  - The diffusion and adoption of modern information technology provide new chance for China to close urban-rural income gap. This paper uses China's provincial panel data from 2002 to 2013 to investigate the effect of computer penetration on rural residents' income. A public program aiming to connect every village with broadband Internet and other rural facilities provides plausibly exogenous variation in rural residents' availability and adoption of the broadband Internet, which is used to explore the instrument variable for rural computer penetration. The results show that rural computer penetration tends to increase rural residents' income over time, but the average effect remains limited. The dynamic panel threshold effects model, which allows for both the threshold variable and other covariates to be endogenous, is further used to explore the constraints of the income-increase effect of rural computer penetration. It shows that the effect is at least doubled over the average effect estimated from instrument variables method, once the digital divide causes are removed. Our findings have important implications for the government to increase rural residents' income and reduce urban-rural income gap by encouraging rural computer usage and removing the digital divide.

AB  - Digital terrestrial television currently incorporates accessibility elements for the deaf (closed captions, CCs) and for the blind (audio description and audio navigation), however the deafblind population has particular accessibility needs that to date have not been met. This work presents a technical aid (a mobile application called GoAll) developed to increase the autonomy of deafblind individuals, allowing direct access to content broadcast on digital TV through the reading of CCs either with a mobile device or a Braille display. The information in this study is based on the data generated by the application server during the 5 months it was in operation in Spain as well as data from a usability survey conducted on nine deafblind individuals. The results show that 55% of the people used the application between 5 and 7 days a week and did so in the most popular time slots; those surveyed watch news, movies, documentaries, reality shows, and entertainment shows. Noteworthy is fact that all survey respondents said they felt they had greater autonomy with this application. The limitations of the proposed solution involve two elements: Braille reading (knowledge and speed of reading) and the constraints of CCs, since they are used as an input for technical assistance.

AB  - Background: We examined patient interest in a telehealth model in which the patient supplies the hardware and Internet connectivity to meet with a healthcare provider from his or her home via video call (video appointment). We hoped to understand prospectively the desirability, feasibility, and viability from the patient perspective. Materials and Methods: A phone survey was conducted of a random sample of patients who had been seen in the outpatient setting at a single institution. The sample was stratified by proximity to the local institution with oversampling for patients living outside a 120-mile radius. Results: Out of 500 total patients, 301 patients responded, and 263 met the inclusion criteria. Of those 263 respondents, 38% indicated 'very likely' to accept an invitation to see their provider via video, 28.1% 'somewhat likely,' and 33.8% 'not at all likely.' Of respondents, 75% have broadband, although only 36% reported having a Web camera. The primary factors affecting willingness to participate in a video appointment include comfort in setting up a video call, age, and distance participants would have traveled for an in-clinic appointment. Conclusions: Patient survey data indicate that most patients are likely to be accepting of telehealth care to the home using video call and that most have the required technology. Nevertheless, there are still significant hurdles to effectively implement this adaptation of telehealth care as part of mainstream practice.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine sleep habits (i.e., bedtimes and rising times) and their association with nighttime text messaging in 15- to 17-year-old adolescents. This cross-sectional study analyzed data from a web-based survey of adolescent students attending secondary schools in southern Sweden (N = 278, 50% female). Less than 8 hr of time in bed during school nights was significantly associated with more sleep difficulties, wake time variability on school days and weekends, daytime tiredness, and less enjoyment at school (all ps < .05). Sending and/or receiving text messages (Short Message Service [SMS]) at night was significantly associated with later bedtimes, shorter time in bed, daytime tiredness during school, and irregular sleep habits (p < .05). These findings highlight the importance of regular, consistent sleep habits and the problems associated with sleeping with a cell phone in the bedroom.

However, many questions remain unresolved regarding the social capabilities robots should have in order to perform this interaction in an ever more natural manner. In this paper, we tackle this problem through a comprehensive study of various topics involved in the interaction between a mobile robot and untrained human volunteers for a variety of tasks. In particular, this work presents a framework that enables the robot to proactively approach people and establish friendly interaction. To this end, we provided the robot with several perception and action skills, such as that of detecting people, planning an approach and communicating the intention to initiate a conversation while expressing an emotional status. We also introduce an interactive learning system that uses the person’s volunteered assistance to incrementally improve the robot’s perception skills. As a proof of concept, we focus on the particular task of online face learning and recognition. We conducted real-life experiments with our Tibi robot to validate the framework during the interaction process. Within this study, several surveys and user studies have been realized to reveal the social acceptability of the robot within the context of different tasks.

AB  - Aims and objectives: The aims were to explore advanced practice nurses' perceptions on wireless Personal Digital Assistant technologies, to establish the type and range of tools that would be useful to support their practice and to identify any requirements and limitations that may impact the implementation of wireless Personal Digital Assistants in practice. Background: The wireless Personal Digital Assistant is becoming established as a hand-held computing tool for healthcare professionals. The reflections of advanced practice nurses' about the value of wireless Personal Digital Assistants and its potential to contribute to improved patient care has not been investigated. Design: A qualitative interpretivist design was used to explore advanced practice nurses' perceptions on the value of wireless Personal Digital Assistant technologies to support their practice. Methods: The data were collected using survey questionnaires and individual and focus group interviews with nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists and information technology managers based in British Columbia, Canada. An open-coding content analysis was performed using qualitative data analysis software. Results: Wireless Personal Digital Assistant's use supports the principles of pervasivity and is a technology rapidly being adopted by advanced practice nurses. Some nurses indicated a reluctance to integrate wireless Personal Digital Assistant technologies into their practices because of the cost and the short technological life cycle of these devices. Many of the barriers which precluded the use of wireless networks within facilities are being removed. Nurses demonstrated a complex understanding of wireless Personal Digital Assistant technologies and gave good rationales for its integration in their practice. Conclusions: Nurses identified improved client care as the major benefit of this technology in practice and the type and range of tools they identified included clinical reference tools such as drug and diagnostic/laboratory reference applications and wireless communications. Relevance to clinical practice: Nurses in this study support integrating wireless mobile computing technologies into their practice to improve client care.

AB  - Disaster management utilizes diverse technologies to accomplish a complex set of tasks. Despite a decade of experience, few published reports have reviewed application of telemedicine (clinical care at a distance enabled by telecommunication) in disaster situations. Appropriate new telemedicine applications can improve future disaster medicine outcomes, based on lessons learned from a decade of civilian and military disaster (wide-area) telemedicine deployments. This manuscript reviews the history of telemedicine activities in actual disasters and similar scenarios as well as ongoing telemedicine innovations that may be applicable to disaster situations. Emergency care providers must begin to plan effectively to utilize disaster-specific telemedicine applications to improve future outcomes.

AB  - The Oregon Citizens? Initiative Review (CIR) distinguishes itself by linking a small deliberative body to the larger electoral process. Since 2010, CIR citizen panels have been a legislatively authorized part of Oregon general elections to promote a more informed electorate. The CIR gathers a representative cross-section of two dozen voters for 5 days of deliberation on a single ballot measure. The process culminates in the citizen panelists writing a Citizens? Statement that the secretary of state inserts into the official Voters? Pamphlet sent to each registered voter. This study analyzes the effect of one such Citizens? Statement from the 2010 general election. In Study 1, an online survey experiment found that reading this Statement influenced Oregon voters? values trade-offs, issue knowledge, and vote intentions. In Study 2, regression analysis of a cross-sectional phone survey found a parallel association between the Statement?s use and voting choices but yielded some mixed findings.

AB  - The ICT technology expansion and rapid penetration supported by extensive research and innovations has started to change the users' requirements for novel services and applications. Up to now, the evolution of wireless communication systems only focused on improving the way the information is exchanged between two or a group of communication entities. However, emerging user expectations for novel personalized scenarios have driven the requirement for revolutionary and divergent approaches that will foster the virtualization of human emotions, senses, and thoughts. Human Bond Communication reflects this communications paradigm shift. It represents a holistic approach capable of describing and transmitting the features of an object in the way a human perceives it. Human Bond Communication incorporates all human senses for modeling a physical object into an information-digital domain. It also focuses on actuating and transmitting the data of the physical object through an underlying communication platform. This paper elaborates on the Human Bond Communication related topics, providing a comprehensive classification and survey of the current research works, as well as identifying the key challenges for future research.

AB  - Lectures are designed to deliver new information to a large group of students. Apart from actual lecturing, lecturers may also encourage elaboration of learning material with advanced instructions, like advance organizer, summaries and repetitions as well as questions. Prerequisite to learning from lectures is that students focus on the lecture and cognitively process what is being presented. In today’s lectures, mobile devices, (i.e. laptops and smartphones), may aid students to research additional information online or to take notes, but may also distract students. In this descriptive study, 86 students with 91 mobile devices out of five lectures were observed with respect to how they utilized mobile devices for lecture-related and -unrelated activities. Additionally, we observed 21 lecturers and coded their behavior. The results indicate that lecturing correlates only slightly with student activities. Students use media mostly in a lecture-unrelated way. Giving negative feedback seems to foster students’ lecture-unrelated media use. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The early twenty-first century has seen dramatic changes in the survey climate and landscape. Advances in technology along with changes in coverage for different survey modes have led to an environment where many surveys are now being conducted in whole or in part via self-administered web questionnaires. Traditional pretesting methodologies that do not assess the technology used by the survey itself may miss important quality concerns these newer modes introduce (mode effects). And while traditional pretesting methods have provided great insight into the errors to be addressed in surveys prior to fielding, they can be costly, time consuming, and limited in the range of perspectives gained. This chapter introduces emerging survey pretesting methodologies and compares these with traditional methods to consider whether these methods can be combined to improve today's web and mobile survey needs. It begins by reviewing traditional pretesting methods such as expert review, cognitive interviewing, and pilot testing. Next, the chapter introduces emerging pretesting methods including usability testing, eye tracking, and online pretesting. It concludes with a discussion of the optimal combination of traditional and newer methods for pretesting modern web surveys. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Despite the ubiquitous use of new communication technologies, gaps in our knowledge remain regarding who is likely to rely on particular technologies and potential ramifications of these forms of communication on individuals’ relationships and adjustment. In an online survey, 211 college students reported on their use of electronic communication with a parent who they identified as their closest family member. Results indicated that students who report more frequent phone conversations with parents also report more satisfying, intimate, and supportive parental relationships, but those students who use a social-networking site to communicate with parents report higher levels of loneliness, anxious attachment, as well as conflict within the parental relationship. The findings offer new evidence on how electronic communication technology with parents is related to adjustment in college students. Our study also suggests that further research is needed using longitudinal designs to understand better young adults’ use of technology to communicate in today’s society.

AB  - Background: Mobile phone use while driving is a well-recognized area of concern. However, while texting/calling among young adult drivers has received much research attention, more research is needed regarding other phone functions used by young adults while driving.
Study aim: To explore mobile phone functions used by young adult drivers while driving.
Results: An online survey of 17-24 year old drivers (N=612; 428 females) and focus groups with drivers aged (N=18; 8 females) revealed that mobile phone use while driving was a very common behavior, with more full licence drivers compared with Learner/Provisional drivers using their phone to make/answer calls, send/read text messages and for internet browsing. This nature of mobile phone use while driving was varied, with phones commonly used for entertainment (e.g., to play music), to connect with others (via texting and/or voice calls) and for navigation.
Concluding remarks: Young adults use a variety of functions on their phone while driving. It is important that young driver-targeted intervention efforts acknowledge that multiple functions of the mobile phone are used during the drive and it serves multiple purposes. Examining the inhibitors and facilitators of mobile phone use and its various functions while driving is needed, in addition to elucidating if the usage of particular mobile phone functions is similar across different driver cohorts.

AB  - How do people find answers to questions they encounter in everyday life? While extensive research has examined how people go about finding answers to questions online, there has been little work investigating the issue from a more holistic, in situ perspective that covers the various devices, resources, and contextual factors that influence everyday question-asking experiences. To address this, we developed a text-messaging-based data-collection framework. This paper details our approach including reflections on both the benefits and challenges of the methodology for researchers seeking to apply similar approaches to social science research. In doing so, we demonstrate how our methodology helps establish a contextually rich understanding of information-seeking processes. We also demonstrate our approach to analyzing data from a small but diverse group of adults across the United States about their everyday question-asking experiences.

AB  - In this article we develop an approach to coincidences as discursive activities. To illustrate the range of empirical questions that can be explored in the analysis of coincidence accounts, we examine one single written account, which was submitted to a website of a research project to investigate the statistical dimensions of coincidence experiences. Our analysis is broadly ethnomethodological in that we examine this single case to identify how structural and narrative components work to constitute the recognizably coincidental quality of the events so described. The analysis identifies a mirror structure that resembles chiasmus, a figurative device found in classical texts. The analysis also describes how the account is designed to address inferential matters related to the site to which it was submitted. In the discussion we reflect on the implications of this approach for other approaches to coincidence.

AB  - Existing web applications force users focus their visual attention on mobile devices while browsing content and services while on the go. To support eyes-free, mobile experiences, designers can minimize interaction with a device by leveraging the auditory channel. Whereas acoustic interfaces have proven to be effective in reducing visual attention, a perplexing challenge is designing aural information architectures for the web. To address this problem, techniques to remodel existing information architectures as linear, aural flows were introduced and evaluated. Mobile web browsing with aural flows is exemplified in ANFORA News, a semiaural mobile site designed to browse large collections of news stories. An exploratory study involving frequent news readers (n=20) investigated the usability and navigation experience with ANFORA News in a mobile setting. Initial evidence suggests that aural flows are a promising paradigm to support eyes-free mobile navigation while on the go, but users still require assistance and additional learning to fully master the aural mechanics of the flows while on the go. Future work will improve on the mechanisms to customize content and control the aural navigation.

AB  - Purpose
Mobile phones have become one of the most favored devices to maintain social connections as well as logging digital information about personal lives. The privacy of the metadata being generated in this process has been a topic of intense debate over the last few years, but most of the debate has been focused on stonewalling such data. At the same time, such metadata is already being used to automatically infer a user's preferences for commercial products, media, or political agencies. The purpose of this paper is to understand the predictive power of phone usage features on individual privacy attitudes.
Design/methodology/approach
The present study uses a mixed-method approach, involving analysis of mobile phone metadata, self-reported survey on privacy attitudes and semi-structured interviews. This paper analyzes the interconnections between user's social and behavioral data as obtained via their phone with their self-reported privacy attitudes and interprets them based on the semi-structured interviews.
Findings
The findings from the study suggest that an analysis of mobile phone metadata reveals vital clues to a person's privacy attitudes. This study finds that multiple phone signals have significant predictive power on an individual's privacy attitudes. The results motivate a newer direction of automatically inferring a user's privacy attitudes by leveraging their phone usage information.
Practical implications
An ability to automatically infer a user's privacy attitudes could allow users to utilize their own phone metadata to get automatic recommendations for privacy settings appropriate for them. This study offers information scientists, government agencies and mobile app developers, an understanding of user privacy needs, helping them create apps that take these traits into account.
Originality/value
The primary value of this paper lies in providing a better understanding of the predictive power of phone usage features on individual privacy attitudes.

AB  - This study focuses on second screening for news, a hybrid media process that combines watching news on television and a second, web‐connected screen (i.e., smart‐phone, laptop). Based on U.S.‐national, 2‐wave panel data, the paper (a) examines people's motivations to engage in second screen use, and then (b) advances the relationship between second screening and online political behaviors. Discussing and pursuing further information are both central motivations for second screen use. Furthermore, results suggest second screening for news is a significant predictor of online political participation and a key link between TV news and political engagement as this relationship is fully mediated. The study advances theoretically and empirically ways in which an informed public opinion may partake of a more engaged democracy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Research Summary 
Public interest and policy debates surrounding the role of the Internet in terrorist activities is increasing. Criminology has said very little on the matter. By using a unique data set of 223 convicted United Kingdom-based terrorists, this article focuses on how they used the Internet in the commission of their crimes. As most samples of terrorist offenders vary in terms of capabilities (lone-actor vs. group offenders) and criminal sophistication (improvised explosive devices vs. stabbings), we tested whether the affordances they sought from the Internet significantly differed. The results suggest that extreme-right-wing individuals, those who planned an attack (as opposed to merely providing material support), conducted a lethal attack, committed an improvised explosive device (IED) attack, committed an armed assault, acted within a cell, attempted to recruit others, and engaged in nonvirtual network activities and nonvirtual place interactions were significantly more likely to learn online compared with those who did not engage in these behaviors. Those undertaking unarmed assaults were significantly less likely to display online learning. The results also suggested that extreme-right-wing individuals who perpetrated an IED attack, associated with a wider network, attempted to recruit others, and engaged in nonvirtual network activities and nonvirtual place interactions were significantly more likely to communicate online with co-ideologues.
Policy Implications
Collectively the results provide insight into violent radicalization as a whole and not just into violent online radicalization. The results also largely confirm the results found in von Behr, Reding, Edwards, and Gribbon (2013) and in Gill and Corner (2015). The current study and the two previous studies have tackled these questions by using numerous methodological approaches and data sources and have arrived at similar conclusions. The Internet is largely a facilitative tool that affords greater opportunities for violent radicalization and attack planning. Nevertheless, radicalization and attack planning are not dependent on the Internet, and policy needs to look at behavior, intentions, and capabilities and not just at beliefs. From a risk assessment perspective, the study also highlights the fact that there is no easy offline versus online violent radicalization dichotomy to be drawn. It may be a false dichotomy. Plotters regularly engage in activities in both domains. Often their behaviors are compartmentalized across these two domains. Threat management policies would do well to understand the individuals' breadth of interactions rather than relying on a dichotomous understanding of offline versus online, which represent two extremes of a spectrum that regularly provide prototypical examples in reality. A preoccupation with only checking online behaviors may lead an intelligence analyst to miss crucial face-to-face components of a plot's technical development or a perpetrator's motivation. Policy and practice may benefit from adopting insights from emerging research arguing in favor of disaggregating our conception of the "terrorist" into discrete groups (e.g., foreign fighters vs. homegrown fighters, bomb-makers vs. bomb-planters, and group-actors vs. lone-actors; Gill and Corner, 2013; LaFree, 2013) rather than disaggregating the radicalization process into discrete groups (e.g., online radicalization and prison radicalization). We need to understand the drives, needs, and forms of behavior that led to the radicalization and attack planning and why the offender chose that environment rather than purely looking at the affordances the environment produced. By looking at the Internet as an affordance opportunity that some forms of terrorist or terrorist violence require more than others do, the focus is shifted from the radicalization process toward an understanding of how crimes are committed. In other words, we are looking at crime events rather than at the underlying dispositions behind the criminality.

AB  - In recent decades changes in social connectivity have become key features in the changing contexts of later life. Communities of propinquity no longer seem to be as determining of social relationships as they once were. Mobile cell phone technology and the Internet have redefined what it means to ?keep in touch?. Some authors have argued that these new forms of connectivity have created a ?digital divide? between those who have become active adopters of these technologies and those who have not. Using data from the British General Household Survey (GHS), we examined trends in mobile phone ownership amongst people over fifty during the period 2000 - 2009. Compared with the pace of change in ownership of other household technologies such as personal computers, dishwashers, fridge freezers and microwave ovens, the take up of mobile phones amongst those aged 50 and over has followed a much sharper rise. Based upon these findings, we suggest a more sceptical stance towards the ICT ?generational divide? which needs more detailed interrogation. Future research should consider the possibility that the divide may be a more short lived phenomenon, as successive cohorts of people aged fifty and over are becoming active participants in individualised networked communities.

AB  - The proliferation of digital technology-both as hardware and software-provides opportunities for activist groups around the world to connect with one another more rapidly and efficiently than ever before. And as mobile Internet technology (including smartphones, personal digital assistants, and laptops) becomes cheaper and more readily available, the number of services offered to individuals has increased dramatically, including voice communication, Internet browsing, and data transfer. At the same time, the rise in transnational advocacy networks means that non-state actors are garnering new voices and challenging both old and new sites of authority, from local governments and state agencies to regional and international organizations. Based on fieldwork and with a focus on the process of interaction within transnational groups in Southeast Asia, this article adopts a communities of practice (COP) approach and applies it to the impact of digital networking in order to test some of the questions posed about the nature of the so-called technological revolution and to assess the ways in which technological advancement has affected these groups. It hypothesizes that even new and potentially levelling forms of communication can only respond to and reshape the pre-existing social conditions and organizational structures within which network participants function.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the distributed presentation of different versions of a question would produce better performance on a new version of the question than distributed presentation of the same version of the question. A total of 48 four question sets of five alternative multiple-choice questions were presented during a college lecture course. The answers to all the four questions in each set required an inference from the same fact statement. One question in each set appeared on both a block exam and the final. Each of the other three questions was presented either on an online quiz before class, during class or on an online quiz a week after class. Answering different versions of a question before class, during class and after class resulted in better performance on a fourth version of the question on the exam and final than answering the same question before class, during class and after class. On the final exam, 44 questions were answered twice, first under a time constraint of 90 seconds and then when response time was unlimited. The two responses were virtually identical.

AB  - Highway corridor surveys are becoming more difficult and expensive to carry out because of the need to minimize lane closures, traffic disruptions, and safety hazards posed to the surveyors and public. Roadway surveyors are at risk when working in the traffic corridor if they are unable to move with the flow of traffic. Safety for the traveling public is also a concern when lanes are closed or blocked by slow-moving vehicles. Costs for the placement of safety features to protect a survey crew can in some instances be greater than the cost of the survey itself. To mitigate these problems, a survey data acquisition tool is needed that can collect topographic and infrastructure information without disrupting traffic flow. Terrapoint has developed a novel kinematic laser scanning system that can be deployed on a passenger vehicle or small watercraft. Light-detection and ranging (LIDAR) digital imagery and video are collected from the survey platform while it is moving at traffic speeds. The system is georeferenced with a high-accuracy Global Positioning System?inertial measurement unit. Terrapoint's mobile LIDAR scanner has successfully surveyed existing highway corridors all over North America. It has also proven sufficiently accurate for scanning airport runway surfaces so as to predict areas where water will pool. Moving with the traffic flow and not requiring an escort, the system scans a 360° swath that includes the pavement surface and objects to the sides and above the survey vehicle.

AB  - While mobile media, such as low-cost mobiles, smartphones, tablets, and mobile Internet, are being taken up widely around the globe, we have little understanding about their implications for media geographies. In this paper, we take up the question of mobile media geographies via a case study of the 2012 Mexican election – and the student movement called #yosoy132. In this paper, we examine the political and cultural stakes of online and mobile media #yosoy132 entails, arguing for the need to appreciate the specific histories of politics, culture, and technology in which mobile screens unfold in Mexico and its diasporic communities.

AB  - In this paper, I approach the question of mobiles in Asian countries by considering the case of Australia. I do so by way of a preliminary inquiry that seeks to explore the intersection between the emergence of mobiles in Australia with transformations in that country's sense of its relationship with Asia. First, I discuss the history of the mobile phone in Australia, noting some important uses and representations that formed part of its social shaping. Second, I explore mobiles and the paradoxes of multiculturalism, and also how digital technologies became central to political culture and identity debates in Australia in the early to-mid 1990s. Third, I look at some important moments in the social shaping of text messaging, in which questions of cultural difference were decisive. Finally, I offer concluding remarks about future research on mobiles in Australia and how they are tied into Asian identities. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - The present study investigates the roles of smartphone usage, self-regulation, general self-efficacy and cyberloafing in smartphone addiction. We conducted an online survey which received responses from 598 participants attending a public university in Ankara, Turkey. The results showed that both the duration of smartphone usage and cyberloafing positively affected smartphone addiction. The effect of self-regulation on smartphone addiction was negative and significant. In addition, neither self-regulation nor general self-efficacy had an effect on cyberloafing. Research results are discussed within the context of the effect of smartphone addiction on learning environments and individuals. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective Many mobile phone resources have been developed to increase access to health education in the developing world, yet few studies have compared these resources or quantified their performance in a resourcelimited setting. This study aims to compare the performance of resident physicians in answering clinical scenarios using PubMed abstracts accessed via the PubMed for Handhelds (PubMed4Hh) website versus medical/drug reference applications (Medical Apps) accessed via software on the mobile phone. Methods A two-arm comparative study with crossover design was conducted. Subjects, who were resident physicians at the University of Botswana, completed eight scenarios, each with multi-part questions. The primary outcome was a grade for each question. The primary independent variable was the intervention arm and other independent variables included residency and question. Results Within each question type there were significant differences in 'percentage correct' between Medical Apps and PubMed4Hh for three of the six types of questions: drug-related, diagnosis/definitions, and treatment/management. Within each of these question types, Medical Apps had a higher percentage of fully correct responses than PubMed4Hh (63% vs 13%, 33% vs 12%, and 41% vs 13%, respectively). PubMed4Hh performed better for epidemiologic questions. Conclusions While mobile access to primary literature remains important and serves an information niche, mobile applications with condensed content may be more appropriate for point-of-care information needs. Further research is required to examine the specific information needs of clinicians in resource-limited settings and to evaluate the appropriateness of current resources in bridging location- and context-specific information gaps.

AB  - This article examines the effect of the advent and diffusion of e-commerce on supply-side industry structure. We specify a general industry model involving consumers with differing search costs buying products from heterogeneous producers. We interpret e-commerce as a reduction in consumers' search costs. We show how it reallocates market shares from high-cost to low-cost producers. We test the model using US data for three industries: travel agencies, bookstores and new car dealers. Each industry exhibits the market share shifts predicted by the model but the mechanisms vary, ranging from aggregate factors in the travel industry to local-market factors in the other two industries. © The Author(s).

AB  - Access to the medical literature has not kept pace with the mobile revolution. We aimed to (1) gauge interest in a smartphone-optimized Web site for conveniently accessing otolaryngology literature and (2) create an easy-to-access and convenient Web site that displays otolaryngology journal abstracts in a format optimized for smartphones. A survey was sent to physicians of a major US academic otolaryngology?head and neck surgery department. Demographics, literature-browsing habits, and barriers to staying updated were assessed. The response rate was 87%. Ninety-one percent of respondents used a smartphone, and 85% wished they could stay more up to date with the otolaryngology literature. Most respondents believed a convenient smartphone-optimized Web site could help them achieve this goal. A Web site was then developed in collaboration with a university creative department as a proof of concept. The site uses a simple RSS aggregator to display journal abstracts formatted for smartphone-sized screens (www.otosurg.com).

AB  - Research problem: A construct mediated in digital environments, information communication technology (ICT) literacy is operationally defined as the ability of individuals to participate effectively in transactions that invoke illocutionary action. This study investigates ICT literacy through a simulation designed to capture that construct, to deploy the construct model to measure participant improvement of ICT literacy under experimental conditions, and to estimate the potential for expanded model development. Research questions: How might a multidisciplinary literature review inform a model for ICT literacy? How might a simulation be designed that enables sufficient construct representation for modeling? How might prepost testing simulation be designed to investigate the potential for improved command of ICT literacy? How might a regression model account for variance within the model by the addition of affective elements to a cognitive model? Literature review: Existing conceptualizations of the ICT communication environment demonstrate the need for a new communication model that is sensitive to short text messaging demands in crisis communication settings. As a result of this prefect storm of limits requiring the communicator to rely on critical thinking, awareness of context, and information integration, we designed a cognitive-affective model informed by genre theory to capture the ICT construct: A sociocognitive ability that, at its most effective, facilitates illocutionary action-to confirm and warn, to advise and ask, and to thank and request-for specific audiences of emergency responders. Methodology: A prepost design with practitioner subjects allowed investigation of performance improvement on tasks demanding illocutionary action after training on tasks of high, moderate, and low demand. Through a model based on the independent variables character count, wordcount, and decreased time on task as related to the dependent variable of an overall episode score, we were able to examine the internal construct strength with and without the addition of affective independent variables. Results and discussion: Of the three prepost models used to study the impact of training, participants demonstrated statistically significant improvement on episodes of high demand on all cognitive model variables. The addition of affective variables, such as attitudes toward text messaging, allowed increased model strength on tasks of high and moderate complexity. These findings suggest that an empirical basis for the construct of ICT literacy is possible and that, under simulation conditions, practitioner improvement may be demonstrated. Practically, it appears that it is possible to train emergency responders to improve their command of ICT literacy so that those most in need of humanitarian response during a crisis may receive it. Future research focusing on communication in digital environments will undoubtedly extend these finding in terms of construct validation and deployment in crisis settings.

AB  - Microblogging and mobile devices appear to augment human social capabilities, which raises the question whether they remove cognitive or biological constraints on human communication. In this paper we analyze a dataset of Twitter conversations collected across six months involving 1.7 million individuals and test the theoretical cognitive limit on the number of stable social relationships known as Dunbar’s number. We find that the data are in agreement with Dunbar’s result; users can entertain a maximum of 100–200 stable relationships. Thus, the ‘economy of attention’ is limited in the online world by cognitive and biological constraints as predicted by Dunbar’s theory. We propose a simple model for users’ behavior that includes finite priority queuing and time resources that reproduces the observed social behavior.

AB  - The social currency, the existing potential resource in the social networks and communities of an individual, has become more significant in the era of information technology. Meanwhile, the rapid development of Internet service, especially its application on mobile devices, brings many new contents of prosocial behaviors (PBs), which benefits both individuals and communities. Specifically, social currency plays a positive role in promoting PB, forming positive personalities, promoting positive social adaptation, and contributing to human survival and social development. However, the theoretical research in this field still lags far behind the development of practice, and the research on the impact of social currency on PB remains exceedingly scarce. Grounded in the social exchange theory (SET), the present study collects a total of 497 WeChat user questionnaires, constructs a model for the influence mechanism of social currency on PB, and tests the hypothesis through hierarchical regression. According to the results obtained, it was found that the social currency is positively associated with PB, and users with a more social currency are more likely to act prosocially on their own. The PB of an individual is then influenced by the social currency generated through collective self-esteem (CS) so that the perception of CS can be considered as a mediating variable. Moreover, the communication network heterogeneity (CNH) moderates the above relationship, and the degree of heterogeneity will have different effects on the relationship of CS. The obtained conclusions enrich the previous theoretical results of PB and provided new insights for social managers to enhance the prosocial-related behaviors for the group, organization, and society.</p>

AB  - With the boom of mobile Internet and the popularization of smartphones, live streaming platforms have become an important marketing tool for online and physical stores. Based on signal theory and cognitive psychology, this paper discusses how the information content on live streaming platforms influences the impulse purchase of consumers, and how the influence is affected by psychological distance and streamer admiration of consumers. First, several hypotheses were put forward about the mediation role of psychological distance and the moderation role of streamer admiration. Then, the research data were collected through a questionnaire survey among the audience of live streaming platforms, and were analyzed through hierarchical regression to test the hypotheses. The results show that the information content of live streaming platforms has a significant positive impact on the impulse purchase of consumers; this impact is mediated by the psychological distance; the relationship between information content and psychological distance is moderated by streamer admiration. The research results provide new insights into the marketing effect of live streaming platforms and live streamers.

AB  - This study examines the role of IT identity, maladaptive cognitions, and maladaptive emotions on problematic online gaming. By collecting multiwave survey data, embeddedness, self-efficacy, and perceived enjoyment are found to be key determinants of IT identity. Furthermore, IT identity positively influences intrusive thought, thought suppression, emotion irreplaceability, and negative emotion anticipation. Finally, intrusive thought, thought suppression, and negative emotion anticipation collectively predict problematic online gaming and fully mediate the effect of IT identity on problematic online gaming. This study contributes to the literature by offering noteworthy insights on the formation of problematic online gaming and identifying implications for effectively curbing problematic online gaming.

AB  - Objective: To date, no research has evaluated the efficacy of a stand-alone, smartphone-based intervention for individuals with an alcohol use disorder. The current pilot study evaluated the short-term outcomes of a smartphone-based intervention for alcohol use disorders compared with an Internet-based brief motivational intervention plus bibliotherapy. Method: Adults (18 to 45 years old) with an alcohol use disorder received either the Location-Based Monitoring and Intervention for Alcohol Use Disorders (LBMI-A; n = 28), a smartphone-based intervention, or the online Drinker's Check-up plus bibliotherapy (DCU + bib; n = 26). These groups were compared using the Timeline Followback interview for percent days abstinent (PDA), percent heavy drinking days (PHDD), and drinks per week (DPW) from baseline to 6 weeks after the introduction of the interventions. Results: Multilevel models revealed that the LBMI-A resulted in a significant increase in PDA over the course of the study, whereas the DCU + bib did not. Effect sizes for change from baseline for PDA suggest that the DCU + bib resulted in moderate a decrease, whereas the LBMI-A resulted in a large increase in PDA. Both interventions resulted in significant decreases in PHDD and DPW. The LBMI-A produced larger reductions in the first 3 to 4 weeks after the intervention was introduced than the DCU + bib. On weeks with greater LBMI-A usage, participants reported less DPW and PHDD. Conclusions: Both interventions resulted in significant decreases in alcohol use over the 6-week trial, which is promising for stand-alone technology-based intervention systems aimed at individuals with an alcohol use disorder.

AB  - Objective: There is a need to integrate the various theoretical frameworks and formalisms for modeling clinical guidelines, workflows, and pathways, in order to move beyond providing support for individual clinical decisions and toward the provision of process-oriented, patient-centered, health information systems (HIS). In this review, we analyze the challenges in developing process-oriented HIS that formally model guidelines, workflows, and care pathways. Methods: A qualitative meta-synthesis was performed on studies published in English between 1995 and 2010 that addressed the modeling process and reported the exposition of a new methodology, model, system implementation, or system architecture. Thematic analysis, principal component analysis (PCA) and data visualisation techniques were used to identify and cluster the underlying implementation 'challenge' themes. Results: One hundred and eight relevant studies were selected for review. Twenty-five underlying 'challenge' themes were identified. These were clustered into 10 distinct groups, from which a conceptual model of the implementation process was developed. Discussion and conclusion: We found that the development of systems supporting individual clinical decisions is evolving toward the implementation of adaptable care pathways on the semantic web, incorporating formal, clinical, and organizational ontologies, and the use of workflow management systems. These architectures now need to be implemented and evaluated on a wider scale within clinical settings.

AB  - Previous studies have shown a relationship between the use of communications technology and well-being, particularly mediated through its effect on personal relationships. However, there is some debate over whether this effect is positive or negative. The present study explored this issue further, examining whether the effect varies depending on the type of communications technology, and the nature of the personal relationship. An online survey was conducted with 3421 participants in three countries (Australia, UK and US). It examined the use of ten communication methods, overall satisfaction with life and satisfaction with four different kinds of relationships (close and extended family, and close and distant friends). Results indicate that richer communication methods, which include non-verbal cues, were positively associated with both overall satisfaction with life and satisfaction with relationships. These methods included face-to-face communication, and phone and video calls. Conversely, more restricted methods, such as text messaging and instant messaging, were negatively associated with both variables. Social networking was negatively associated with overall satisfaction, but not with satisfaction with relationships. The strength of the association between a communications method and satisfaction with a relationship varied depending on the type of relationship, but whether it was positive or negative did not change.

AB  - Decades of research emphasize that information alone rarely influences environmental behavior. We addressed the question of, 'what, then, does influence environmental behavior?' by asking more specifically: what factors mediate the relationship between learning about environmentally related issues and engaging in environmentally related behaviors? Following Yin’s case study approach, we designed a California (USA)-based case study focused on four everyday-life activities: purchasing food, commuting, engaging in leisure activities, and interacting with mobile technology. We grounded the study in four propositions that previous sociological, psychological, and learning sciences research suggested might influence learning–behavior connections in complex everyday-life contexts. To address the propositions across the four cases, we conducted 197 short, semi-structured interviews grounded in a narrative, relational frame. Using thematic content analysis, we found support for three of our propositions as mediators of learning–behavior connections; we also uncovered two emergent themes. Our findings suggest a web of elements that affect learning–behavior connections; those elements offer insights for environmentally related programming.

AB  - Blockchain technology has been gaining great interest from a variety of industry sectors, including financial, food processing, and power and energy markets. Realizing the strength of blockchain technology beyond the successful application in the cryptocurrency arena, researchers have been evaluating and using blockchain for applications such as supply chain management, transactive industry (both financial and energy), system integrity, device cybersecurity, identity management, and much more. One of the unique elements of the blockchain technology that made it such a captivating technology to researchers is its plethora of features. Some of the features include smart contracts, cryptocurrency and tokenizing, immutable distributed ledger, cryptographic hashing, and digital signature. In addition, there are multiple types of blockchains, such as permissioned/private and permissionless/public, and various consensus models, such as proof-of-work, proof-of-authority, proof-of-burn, and proof-of-stake. Therefore, it is often nontrivial to determine if an application requires a blockchain. If so, what kind of blockchain and consensus is most appropriate? This article discusses the blockchain applicability framework (BAF), which was specifically designed with the purpose to answer those questions. The BAF is divided into five domains, 18 subdomains, and about 100 controls. It is designed to ingest detailed user requirements to perform a weighted evaluation that is built on mathematical constructs to determine the ideal combination of blockchain that is appropriate for an application. Along with the core logical formulation of the BAF, this article depicts the efficacy of the BAF through two use cases.

AB  - Background: Mobile phones are ubiquitous in everyday life. Scientific studies on the problematic use of mobile phones have given initial indications of negative consequences, such as increased depression and anxiety rates and reduced sleep quality. The Problematic Use of Mobile Phone (PUMP) scale is a well evaluated, 20-item questionnaire, but a German version of the scale is still lacking. Method: An online sample (n = 723, age 27.8 ± 11.2 years, 25.2% men) completed a German translation of the PUMP scale (PUMP-D). We conducted standard item analyses and calculated internal consistency and retest reliability. An exploratory (EFA) and a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were conducted using a random split of the sample, and correlations with the self-estimated time of mobile phone usage and a global self-rating of patterns of problematic use were computed. Additionally, a second sample (n = 256, age 25.0 ± 8.8 years, 34.0% men) completed the paper version of the PUMP-D scale twice to determine the 14-day retest reliability. Results: The item-total correlations ranged from r = 0.35 (p < 0.001) to r = 0.75 (p < .001). The internal consistency was α = 0.90. The self-estimated time of usage correlated with the total value of the PUMP-D scale at r = 0.50 (p < .001). The EFA resulted in a single factor, which explained 36% of the variance. The CFA of the showed a moderate fit. The two-week retest reliability in the second sample was r tt = 0.87 (p < .001). Discussion: The German translation of the PUMP-D demonstrated a single factor structure, good psychometric properties and can be used in further research.

AB  - Aim: To identify management practices of Australian speech-language pathologists (SLPs) in the treatment of non-progressive dysarthria using a subsystem approach, and to explore SLPs’ consideration and implementation of the theoretical underpinnings of non-progressive dysarthria management. Method: A 39-item online survey was distributed to Australian SLPs, with 80 responses suitable for data analysis. Results: Practices of SLPs were variable for the management of the speech subsystems. The Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT®) was the most commonly used manualised treatment program, and was employed by 63.77% of respondents. Almost all SLPs (>88%) provided strategies to improve functional communication. There was no clear preference for low tech alternative and augmentative communication (AAC) devices. Speech generating devices were the most commonly employed high tech device. Almost two-thirds of respondents used non-speech oral motor exercises (NSOMEs) in treatment. SLPs had varied frequencies and models of service delivery for intervention. SLPs valued interventions targeting the activity and participation domains of the ICF, however this was restricted by the treatment context and resources available. The majority of SLPs (92.06%) were aware of the principles of motor learning, however many were unsure regarding the specifics of implementation. Conclusion: There is a clear need for further research into the efficacy of treatment techniques to guide decision-making. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

In Study 1 (N = 2,492), respondents completed 20 questions (comprising four short scales) presented in a matrix grid (converted to item-by-item format on mobile phones). We varied the number of rows (5, 10, or 20) and columns (3, 5, or 7) of the matrix on each page. Outcomes included both data quality (straightlining, item skip rate, and internal reliability of scales) and survey experience measures (dropout rate, rating of survey experience, and completion time). Results for row size revealed dropout rate and reported survey difficulty increased as row size increased. For column size, seven columns increased the completion time of the survey, while three columns produced lower scale reliability. There was no interaction between row and column size. The best overall size tested was a 5 ? 5 matrix. In Study 2 (N = 2,570), we tested whether the effects of row size replicated when using a single 20-item scale that crossed page breaks and found that participant survey ratings were still best in the five-row condition. These results suggest that having around five rows or potentially fewer per page, and around five columns for answer options, gives the optimal survey experience, with equal or better data quality, when using matrix-style questions in an online survey. These recommendations will help researchers gain the benefits of using matrices in their surveys with the least downsides of the format.

AB  - Although the quantity of data on the location, status, and management of invasive species is ever increasing, invasive species data sets are often difficult to obtain and integrate. A cyberinfrastructure for such information could make these data available for Internet users. The data can be used to create regional watch lists, to send e-mail alerts when a new species enters a region, to construct models of species' current and future distributions, and to inform management. Although the exchange of environmental data over the Internet in the form of raster data is maturing, and the exchange of species occurrence data is developing quickly, there is room for improvement. In this article, we present a vision for a comprehensive invasive species cyberinfrastructure that is capable of accessing data effectively, creating models of invasive species spread, and distributing this information. © 2008 American Institute of Biological Sciences.

AB  - Comments on an article by J. K. Pepper et al. (see record [rid]2013-02132-004[/rid]). Pepper et al. present the first study of a national sample of U.S. male adolescents' awareness, use, and susceptibility to using e-cigarettes. The 228 participants were sons of parents recruited to participate in an online panel. Pepper et al found high awareness of e-cigarettes—67%—but little use; < 1% had tried them. Of even greater importance, 18% of the sample endorsed being susceptible to trying e-cigarettes, and this was much higher (74%) among participants who reported current smoking. To date, only two studies of national data sets have provided a glimpse into awareness and use of e-cigarettes, and both were among adults. The high rate of awareness among youth is concerning, particularly because the literature raises concerns about e-cigarette products with regard to ingredient and device safety. Given the dearth of empirical research on e-cigarette products and who may be using them, the Pepper et al article makes an important contribution toward understanding how youth are responding to their availability. In their multivariate analysis, being a current smoker was strongly associated with willingness to try e-cigarettes. When the analysis was limited to nonsmoking participants, holding negative beliefs about the typical smoker was associated with less willingness to try e-cigarettes. These findings suggest that e-cigarettes may be perceived by adolescents as symbolically and functionally similar to tobacco cigarettes. Although these findings are limited by a male-only sample, known predictors of initiation of cigarette smoking, such as sensation seeking and positive smoking expectancies, may be relevant factors to examine in future research investigating e-cigarette use among adolescents.

AB  - The last several decades have been characterized by the widespread usage of digital devices, especially smartphones. At the same time, there have been reports of both decline in sleep duration and quality and male fertility decline. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between evening exposure to the light-emitting screens of digital media devices and measures of both sleep and sperm quality. Semen samples were obtained from 116 men undergoing fertility evaluation for the following sperm variables: volume (mL), pH, sperm concentration (million/mL), motility percentage (progressive% + non-progressive motility%), and total sperm count. Exposure to the screens of electronic devices and sleep habits was obtained by means of a questionnaire. Smartphone and tablet usage in the evening and after bedtime was negatively correlated with sperm motility (−0.392; −0.369; p < .05), sperm progressive motility (−0.322; −0.299; p < .05), and sperm concentration (−0.169; p < .05), and positively correlated with the percentage of immotile sperm (0.382; 0.344; p < .05). In addition, sleep duration was positively correlated with sperm total and progressive motility (0.249; 0.233; p < .05) and negatively correlated with semen pH (−0.349; p < .05). A significant negative correlation was observed between subjective sleepiness and total and progressive motility (−0.264; p < .05) as well as total motile sperm number (−0.173; p < .05). The results of this study support a link between evening and post-bedtime exposure to light-emitting digital media screens and sperm quality. Further research is required to establish the proposed causative link and may lead to the future development of relevant therapeutic and lifestyle interventions.

AB  - Malicious code attacks pose a serious threat to the security of information systems, as malware evolved from innocuous conceptual software to advanced and destructive cyber weapons. However, there is still the lack of a comprehensive and useful taxonomy to classify malware according to their behavior, since commonly used names are obsolete and unable to handle the complex and multipurpose currently observed samples. In this article, we present a brief survey on available malware taxonomies, discuss about issues on existing naming schemes and introduce an extensible taxonomy consisting of an initial set of behaviors usually exhibited by malware during an infection. The main goal of our proposed taxonomy is to address the menace of potentially malicious programs based on their observed behaviors, thus aiding in incident response procedures. Finally, we present a case study to evaluate our behavior-centric taxonomy, in which we apply identification patterns extracted from the proposed taxonomy to over 12 thousand known malware samples. The leveraged results show that it is possible to screen malicious programs that exhibit suspicious behaviors, even when they remain undetected by antivirus tools.

AB  - This research investigated faking across test administration modes in an employment testing scenario. For the first time, phone administration was included. Participants (N = 91) were randomly allocated to testing mode (telephone, Internet, or pen-and-paper). Participants completed a personality measure under standard instructions and then under instructions to fake as an ideal police applicant. No significant difference in any faked personality domains as a function of administration mode was found. Effect sizes indicated that the influence of administration mode was small. Limitations and future directions are considered. Overall, results indicate that if an individual intends to fake on a self-report test in a vocational assessment scenario, the electronic administration mode in which the test is delivered may be unimportant.

AB  - Introduction: The literature indicates that few studies have been conducted with persons with visual impairments (that is, those who are blind or have low vision) concerning mobile application or 'app' usage. The current study explores the use of mobile apps with this population globally. Methods: A total of 259 participants with visual impairments completed an online survey. Descriptive statistics and bivariate tests were used to examine associations between demographic characteristics and mobile app use. Results: The participants rated special apps as useful (95.4%) and accessible (91.1%) tools for individuals with visual impairments. More than 90% of the middle-aged adult group strongly agreed with the practicality of special apps, a significantly higher percentage than was observed in the young and old adult groups. In addition, the participants with low vision considered special apps less accessible than did those with blindness (p > .05). Discussion: Results show that persons with visual impairments frequently use apps specifically designed for them to accomplish daily activities. Furthermore, this population is satisfied with mobile apps and would like to see improvements and new apps. Implications for practitioners: Developers of apps for individuals with visual impairments need to refine and test the existing apps. Practitioners need to be knowledgeable about app usage so they can provide effective instruction to their students or clients. This study provides preliminary information regarding app usage among persons with visual impairments. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The proportion of web survey responses submitted from mobile devices such as smartphones is increasing steadily. This trend presents new methodological challenges because mobile responses are often associated with increased breakoffs, which, in turn, can increase nonresponse bias. Using data from a survey of college students with more than 20,000 respondents, response patterns are examined to identify which days and times the survey invitation and reminder emails were most likely to produce nonmobile responses. The findings provide guidance on the optimal timing for recruiting college student sample members via email to reduce their likelihood of responding from a mobile device, and potentially, breaking off.

AB  - The assessment of website quality is considered as a problem of measuring user satisfaction, in order to analyse user perceptions and preferences. The presented pilot user satisfaction survey concerns the major cellular phone service providers in Greece. The analysis is based on a multicriteria preference disaggregation approach for satisfaction benchmarking analysis and consists of the following parts: (1) the user satisfaction analysis, which concerns the identification of customer preferences and includes the estimation of the relative importance and the demanding level of the different user satisfaction dimensions, and (2) the satisfaction benchmarking analysis, which is mainly focused on the performance evaluation of the competitive organisations against the satisfaction criteria, as well as the identification of the competitive advantages of each company. The results presented in this paper demonstrate how business organisations may locate their position against competition, pinpoint their weak points and determine which website characteristics will improve their global performance.

AB  - Today's technologies are thought to scatter our minds. Critics are warning against the onslaught of the digital on the material, especially when it comes to reading. Of course we must draw a distinction between the broad metaphoric idea of a bookshelf as embodying the contents of the mind, and the bookshelf as a purely practical, material tool for storing information, but nonetheless we should question what these new technologies are doing to our identities. The starting point should be the assumption that, despite the idea that the virtual world sees the denaturalization of experience, the digital world is not built on the ephemerality of the invisible, but on a profound groundedness in materiality, of human bodies providing material labor by stuffing broadband cables into the ground, or extracting metals from the ground to produce computers and mobile phones. One only needs to have a look at a few recent developments to understand the nature of this new materiality of the digital age. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: To outline the development and evaluation of an online infertility peer supporter training program.
Methods: Men and women with diverse infertility backgrounds were recruited and trained to provide online peer support to people undergoing fertility treatment. Training required volunteers to (1) read a peer support training manual, (2) watch a webinar, and (3) complete practice questions, each of which was evidence-based and reviewed by key stakeholders.
Results: Seventeen women and one man were trained and provided online peer support. Program satisfaction was high and training materials were rated as helpful. Peer supporters felt comfortable providing support and having their discussions monitored. They liked helping others and the convenience of a mobile application.
Conclusion: Online recruitment and training of infertility peer supporters is feasible. The current program was acceptable and offers steps for improving future online peer support interventions.
Practice implications: Current evidence supports the acceptability and feasibility of this training and supervision program, and provides service providers with information guiding its development and implementation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Social workers are major mental health providers and, thus, can be key players in guiding consumers and their families to accurate information regarding schizophrenia. The present study, using the WebMedQual scale, is a comprehensive analysis across a one-year period at two different time points of the top for-profit and nonprofit sites that provide information regarding schizophrenia. Results demonstrate that the majority of sites offer comprehensive information and useful features. For-profit sites had higher ratings than nonprofit sites. Likewise, there was somewhat greater inconsistency for nonprofit sites across the two rating periods. The results demonstrate that systematic evaluation of online health information about schizophrenia can contribute to a "gold standard" for Internet health-related information. In addition, the results provide information that social workers can use with consumers and their families to guide them to quality online health information. A brief list of top sites is provided for social workers to give to consumers and families.

In the original article, the authors who contributed equally to the article were not listed correctly. The authors Guoxin Fan and Zhengqi Chen were listed as contributing equally. The corrected listing of the authors are present in the erratum.] This cross-sectional study aimed to identify gender differences in the cervical postures when young adults were using mobile phones, as well as the correlations between the postures and the digital devices use (computer and mobile phone). Questionnaires regarding the habits of computer and mobile phone use were administrated to 429 subjects aged from 17 to 33 years old (19.75 ± 2.58 years old). Subjects were instructed to stand habitually and use a mobile phone as in daily life; the sagittal head and cervical postures were measured by head flexion, neck flexion angle and gaze angle. Male participants had a significantly larger head flexion angle (96.41° ± 12.23° vs. 93.57° ± 12.62°, p = 0.018) and neck flexion angle (51.92° ± 9.55° vs. 47.09° ± 9.45°, p < 0.001) than females. There were significant differences in head (F = 3.62, p = 0.014) and neck flexion (F = 3.99, p = 0.009) between different amounts of computer use. Practitioner Summary: We investigated possible gender differences in head and neck postures of young adults using mobile phones, as well as the potential correlations between these postures and digital device use. We found that males displayed larger head and neck flexion angles than females, which were associated with the amount of computer use. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Reports an error in 'Gender difference in mobile phone use and the impact of digital device exposure on neck posture' by Xiaofei Guan, Guoxin Fan, Zhengqi Chen, Ying Zeng, Hailong Zhang, Annan Hu, Guangfei Gu, Xinbo Wu, Xin Gu and Shisheng He (Ergonomics, 2016[Nov], Vol 59[11], 1453-1461). In the original article, the authors who contributed equally to the article were not listed correctly. The authors Guoxin Fan and Zhengqi Chen were listed as contributing equally. The corrected listing of the authors are present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2016-54264-006[/rid]). This cross-sectional study aimed to identify gender differences in the cervical postures when young adults were using mobile phones, as well as the correlations between the postures and the digital devices use (computer and mobile phone). Questionnaires regarding the habits of computer and mobile phone use were administrated to 429 subjects aged from 17 to 33 years old (19.75 ± 2.58 years old). Subjects were instructed to stand habitually and use a mobile phone as in daily life; the sagittal head and cervical postures were measured by head flexion, neck flexion angle and gaze angle. Male participants had a significantly larger head flexion angle (96.41° ± 12.23° vs. 93.57° ± 12.62°, p = 0.018) and neck flexion angle (51.92° ± 9.55° vs. 47.09° ± 9.45°, p < 0.001) than females. There were significant differences in head (F = 3.62, p = 0.014) and neck flexion (F = 3.99, p = 0.009) between different amounts of computer use. Practitioner Summary: We investigated possible gender differences in head and neck postures of young adults using mobile phones, as well as the potential correlations between these postures and digital device use. We found that males displayed larger head and neck flexion angles than females, which were associated with the amount of computer use. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Tablets are increasingly being used in schools for a variety of handwriting tasks. Given that the control of handwriting relies on both visual and proprioceptive feedback, especially in younger writers, this raises the question of whether the texture of the tablet surface affects graphomotor execution. A series of recent studies found that when the smoothness of a tablet screen modifies proprioceptive feedback, the impact on graphomotor execution varies according to the level of the writer's handwriting skills. However, as the writing on the screen remained visible in these studies, participants may have compensated for the decrease in proprioceptive feedback by relying more heavily on visual information. The aim of the present study was therefore to unravel the respective contributions of different types of sensory feedback during handwriting development and, consequently, the compensatory role of visual information when children and adults have to write on a tablet. To this end, we asked second and fifth graders and adult participants to write letters and pseudowords on a plastic board placed on top of a tablet screen. Participants wrote on either the smooth or the granular side of the plastic board (manipulation of surface friction), and with normal vision or behind a shield that hid the hand and handwriting from direct view (manipulation of vision). Kinematic parameters and legibility were recorded to assess handwriting performances. Results revealed a significant interaction between proprioceptive and visual feedback on letter size, pen speed and legibility, regardless of participants' age. Furthermore, reducing the visual and proprioceptive feedback had a greater effect on the children's handwriting performances than on those of adults. Overall, the present study provides new insight into the contribution of the different types of sensory feedback and their interaction with handwriting development. In addition, our results on the impact of tablet surface on graphomotor execution will serve as useful pointers for improving the design of this tool for children, such as increasing the degree of friction of the screen surface.

AB  - Mobile coverage recently has reached an all-time high, and in most countries, high-speed Internet connections are widely available. Due to technological development, smartphones and tablets have become increasingly popular. Accordingly, we have observed an increasing use of mobile devices to complete web surveys and, hence, survey methodologists have shifted their attention to the challenges that stem from this development. The present study investigated whether the growing use of smartphones has decreased how systematically this choice of device varies between groups of respondents (i.e., how selective smartphone usage for completing web surveys is). We collected a data set of 18,520 respondents from 18 web surveys that were fielded in Germany between 2012 and 2016. Based on these data, we show that while the use of smartphones to complete web surveys has considerably increased over time, selectivity with respect to using this device has remained stable.

AB  - Interview duration is an important variable in web surveys because it is a direct measure of the response burden. In this article, we analyze the effects of the survey design, respondent characteristics, and the interaction between these effects on interview duration. For that purpose, we applied multilevel analysis to a data set of 21 web surveys on political attitudes and behavior. Our results showed that factors on both levels, the individual and the survey level, had effects on interview duration. However, the larger share of the variation in interview duration is explained by the characteristics of the respondents. In this respect, we illustrate the impact of mobile devices and panel recruitment on interview duration. In addition, we found important relationships between the respondents? attitudes and how a web survey is designed: Highly motivated respondents spent significantly more time answering cognitively demanding questions than less motivated respondents. When planning a survey, not only the number and formats of questions need to be taken into account but also the expected sample composition and how the participants will respond to the design of the web survey.

AB  - With the increasing use of smartphones in web surveys, considerable efforts have been devoted to reduce the amount of screen space taken up by questions. An emerging stream of research in this area is aimed at optimizing the design elements of rating scales. One suggestion that has been made is to completely abandon verbal labels and use only numeric labels instead. This approach deliberately shifts the task of scale interpretation to the respondents and reduces the information given to them with an intention to reduce their response burden while still preserving the scale meaning. Following prior research, and by drawing on the established model of the cognitive response process, we critically tested these assumptions. Based on a web survey experiment, we found that omitting verbal labels and using only numeric labels instead pushed respondents to focus their responses on the endpoints of a rating scale. Moreover, drawing on response time paradata, we showed that their response burden was not reduced when presented with only numeric labels; quite the opposite was the case, especially when respondents answered the scale with only numeric labels for the first time, which seemed to entail additional cognitive effort. Based on our findings, we advise against using only numeric labels for rating scales in web surveys.

AB  - Mobile Internet applications run on devices such as smartphones and tablets, and have dramatically changed the landscape of applicationgenerated network traffic. The potent combination of millions of such applications and the instant accessibility of high-speed Internet on mobile devices through 3G and now LTE technology has also changed how users themselves interact with the Internet. Specifically, the radio states in LTE such as RRC_Connected and RRC_Idle were designed with more traditional applications such as web browsing and FTP in mind. These traditional applications typically generated traffic only during Active (Connected) state, and once the user session ended, usually the traffic ended too, thus allowing the radio to move to Inactive (Idle) state. However, newer applications such as Facebook and Twitter generate a constant stream of autonomous and/or user generated traffic at all times, thus erasing the previously clear demarcation between Active and Inactive states. This means a given mobile device (or user equipment, in LTE parlance) often ends up moving between Connected and Idle states frequently to send mostly short bursts of data, draining device battery and causing excessive signaling overhead in LTE networks. This problem has grown and attracted the research community's attention to address the negative effects of frequent back and forth transitions between LTE radio states. In this article, we first explore the traffic characteristics of these emerging mobile Internet applications and how they differ from more traditional applications. We investigate their impact on LTE device power and air interface signaling. We then present a survey of state-of-the-art solutions proposed in literature to address the problems, and analyze their merits and demerits. Lastly, we discuss the solutions adopted by 3GPP including the latest developments in Release 11 to handle these issues, and present potential future research directions in this field.

AB  - The aim was to examine whether texting on a mobile phone is a risk factor for musculoskeletal disorders in the neck and upper extremities in a population of young adults.
In a longitudinal population-based cohort study with Swedish young adults (aged 20-24 years) data were collected via a web-based questionnaire at baseline (n = 7092) and after one and five years. Cross-sectional associations were found between text messaging and reported ongoing symptoms in neck and upper extremities (odds ratios, ORs 1.3-2.0). Among symptom-free at baseline prospective associations were only found between text messaging and new cases of reported symptoms in the hand/fingers (OR 2.0) at one year follow up. Among those with symptoms at baseline prospective associations were found between text messaging and maintained pain in neck/upper back (OR 1.6). The results imply mostly short-term effects, and to a lesser extent, long-term effects on musculoskeletal disorders in neck and upper extremities. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: The integration and visualization of multimodal datasets is a common challenge in biomedical informatics. Several recent studies of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data have illustrated important relationships between morphology observed in whole-slide images, outcome, and genetic events. The pairing of genomics and rich clinical descriptions with whole-slide imaging provided by TCGA presents a unique opportunity to perform these correlative studies. However, better tools are needed to integrate the vast and disparate data types. Objective: To build an integrated web-based platform supporting whole-slide pathology image visualization and data integration. Materials and methods: All images and genomic data were directly obtained from the TCGA and National Cancer Institute (NCI) websites. Results: The Cancer Digital Slide Archive (CDSA) produced is accessible to the public (http://cancer. digitalslidearchive.net) and currently hosts more than 20 000 whole-slide images from 22 cancer types. Discussion: The capabilities of CDSA are demonstrated using TCGA datasets to integrate pathology imaging with associated clinical, genomic and MRI measurements in glioblastomas and can be extended to other tumor types. CDSA also allows URL-based sharing of wholeslide images, and has preliminary support for directly sharing regions of interest and other annotations. Images can also be selected on the basis of other metadata, such as mutational profile, patient age, and other relevant characteristics. Conclusions: With the increasing availability of wholeslide scanners, analysis of digitized pathology images will become increasingly important in linking morphologic observations with genomic and clinical endpoints.

AB  - This study investigates the relevant predictors of customer satisfaction and customer loyalty, and explores the group difference by innovativeness or device type, based on equity theory for emerging devices in the initial market of Korea. The results from an online survey of users of emerging devices and structural equation modeling indicate that utilitarian benefit, hedonic benefit, nonmonetary cost, and alternative attractiveness are significant predictors of customer satisfaction, which in turn affects customer loyalty. Hedonic benefit has a stronger relationship with customer satisfaction for more innovative users and nonmonetary cost has a stronger relationship with customer satisfaction for less innovative users. Nonmonetary cost has a negative relationship with customer satisfaction for netbooks; an additional exploratory analysis produced no such evidence for smartphones. These findings suggest managerial implications for customer loyalty regarding emerging devices. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Purpose Low response rates in web surveys and the use of different devices in entering web survey responses are the two main challenges to response quality of web surveys. The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of using interviewers to recruit participants in computer-assisted self-administered interviews (CASI) vs computer-assisted personal interviews (CAPI) and smartphones vs computers on participation rate and web survey response quality. Design/methodology/approach Two field experiments using two similar media use studies on US college students were conducted to compare response quality in different survey modes and response devices. Findings Response quality of computer entry was better than smartphone entry in both studies for open-ended and closed-ended question formats. Device effect was only significant on overall completion rate when interviewers were present. Practical implications Survey researchers are given guidance how to conduct online surveys using different devices and choice of question format to maximize survey response quality. The benefits and limitations of using an interviewer to recruit participants and smartphones as web survey response devices are discussed. Social implications It shows how computer-assisted self-interviews and smartphones can improve response quality and participation for underprivileged groups. Originality/value This is the first study to compare response quality in different question formats between CASI, e-mailed delivered online surveys and CAPI. It demonstrates the importance of human factor in creating sense of obligation to improve response quality.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of smartphones and computers as web survey entry response devices on the quality of responses in different question formats and across different survey invitations delivery modes. The respondents' preference of device and the response immediacy were also compared.
Design/methodology/approach Two field experiments were conducted with a cluster sampling and a census of all students in a public university in the USA.
Findings Device effect on response quality was only found when using computer-aided self-interviews, but not in e-mail delivered web surveys. Even though the computer was the preferred device, but the smartphone's immediate response was significantly higher than the computer.
Research limitations/implications The sample was restricted to college students who are more proficient users of smartphones and have high access to computers. But the direct comparison in the two studies using the same population increases the internal validity of the study comparing different web survey delivery modes.
Practical implications Because of the minor differences in device on response quality, researchers can consider using more smartphones for field work such as computer-aided self-interviews to complement e-mail delivered surveys.
Originality/value This is the first study that compares the response device effects of computer-aided self-interviews and e-mailed delivered web surveys. Because web surveys are increasingly used and various devices are being used to collect data, how respondents behave in different devices and the strengths and weaknesses of different methods of delivery survey help researchers to improve data quality and develop effective web survey delivery and participant recruitment.

AB  - Children with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and intellectual disability (ID), need early intervention and continuous treatment. We aimed to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of mobile application-based interventions in children with ADHD and ID in supporting attention and cognitive function. Twenty-six children with ADHD and/or ID with attention and cognition difficulties were recruited. Participants completed a 12-week mobile application-based intervention. To assess whether digital intervention improved attention and cognitive function, we used the Comprehensive Attention Test (CAT), Cambridge Neuropsychological Tests Automated Battery (CANTAB), and electroencephalography (EEG) to examine direct changes in children's behavior and neural activity. Clinicians and parents assessed changes using the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, Second Edition (BRIEF-2), Korean version of the ADHD Rating Scale (K-ARS), Clinical Global Impression-Improvement Scale, and parental questionnaires. The intervention induced changes in neural activities on EEG and behavior but there were no significant changes in CAT and CANTAB results. Relative theta and alpha power were significantly lower post-intervention in the eyes-open (EO) condition of EEG recording and these changes were mainly observed in the frontal regions of the brain. Parental reports using the BRIEF-2 and K-ARS noted significant improvements in executive function, attention, and hyperactivity-impulsivity. In addition, the clinical impression improved in 60% of participants. These results provide evidence that a mobile application-based intervention has the benefit of supporting children with ADHD and/or ID. Digital intervention could change neural activity and improve children's attention and cognitive function. Given our findings, we suggested that mobile application-based digital therapeutics may have great potential for helping children with neurodevelopmental disorders who need continuous treatment.

AB  - In this study, we investigate whether mobile device use in surveys can be predicted. We aim to identify possible motives for device use and build a model by drawing on theory from technology acceptance research and survey research. We then test this model with a Structural Equation Modeling approach using data of seven waves of the GESIS panel. We test whether our theoretical model fits the data by focusing on measures of fit, and by studying the standardized effects of the model. Results reveal that intention to use a particular device can predict actual use quite well. Ease of smartphone use is the most meaningful variable: if people use a smartphone for specific tasks, their intention to use a smartphone for survey completion is also more likely. In conclusion, investing in ease of use of mobile survey completion could encourage respondents to use mobile devices. This can foremost be established by building well-designed surveys for mobile devices.

AB  - This article reports on an action-research project designed to investigate the effect of a technological intervention on the complex interactions between student engagement, participation, attendance and preparation in a large lecture delivered as part of a compulsory first-year law course, a discipline which has not been the focus of any previous study. The technology used was VotApedia, a form of mobile phone voting, and it was implemented in tandem with constructivist pedagogies such as explicit pre-reading and a prior context of interactive lecturing. Data were collected through observation, via mobile phone voting in class and by an online survey designed to specifically explore the relationship between attendance at VotApedia lectures and factors such as self-reported engagement, attendance and preparation. The findings indicated that student response systems (SRSs) are just as applicable to more Humanities-style disciplines which require divergent questioning, and supported complex interactions between engagement, attendance and preparation. Preliminary findings indicated that, although more work needs to be done, especially on the types of students who prefer to use these systems, there is a clear potential to increase student engagement in large law lectures through the use of SRSs.

AB  - The article first introduces the domestication approach, its origins, its key elements, and its general contributions and limitations. It then examines ways in which the domestication analysis could be developed. One issue concerns contemporary objects of study and research questions given developments in information and communication technologies since the earliest domestication studies. Other issues include developing the analysis of the centrality of ICTs in our lives. Where appropriate, these issues are illustrated by considering examples of the computer, the Internet, and the mobile phone. To illustrate how the domestication framework can inform wider academic and policy fields, the final section considers its contribution to debates about the digital divide.

AB  - Background: The Stand Up Victoria multi-component intervention successfully reduced workplace sitting time in both the short (three months) and long (12 months) term. To further understand how this intervention worked, we aimed to assess the impact of the intervention on four social-cognitive constructs, and examined whether these constructs mediated intervention effects on workplace sitting time at 3 and 12 months post-baseline. Methods: Two hundred and thirty one office-based workers (14 worksites, single government employer) were randomised to intervention or control conditions by worksite. The intervention comprised organisational, environmental, and individual level elements. Participant characteristics and social-cognitive constructs (perceived behavioural control, barrier self-efficacy, perceived organisational norms and knowledge) were measured through a self-administered online survey at baseline, 3 months and 12 months. Workplace sitting time (min/8 h day) was measured with the activPAL3 device. Single multi-level mediation models were performed for each construct at both time points. Results: There were significant intervention effects at 3 months on perceived behavioural control, barrier self-efficacy and perceived organisational norms. Effects on perceived organisational norms were not significant at 12 months. Perceived behavioural control significantly mediated intervention effects at 3 months, accounting for a small portion of the total effect (indirect effect: −8.6 min/8 h day, 95% CI: −18.5, −3.6 min; 7.5% of total effect). At 12 months, barrier self-efficacy significantly mediated the intervention effects on workplace sitting time (indirect effect: −10.3 min/8 h day, 95% CI: −27.3, −2.2; 13.9% of total effect). No significant effects were observed for knowledge at either time point. Conclusions: Strategies that aim to increase workers’ perceived control and self-efficacy over their sitting time may be helpful components of sedentary behaviour interventions in the workplace. However, social-cognitive factors only partially explain variation in workplace sitting reduction. Understanding the importance of other levels of influence (particularly interpersonal and environmental) for initiating and maintaining workplace sedentary behaviour change will be informative for intervention development and refinement.

AB  - A questionnaire-based study aimed to explore the link between Internet addiction, problematic mobile phone use and the occurrence of cognitive failures in daily life. Previous research has suggested that individuals who have lower working memory capacity (WMC) and poorer attentional control (AC) maybe poorer at limiting the distraction effect posed by access to communicative digital media such as the Internet and mobile phones (Unsworth, McMillan, Brewer, & Spillers, 2012). 210 participants completed an online questionnaire which comprised of the Online Cognition Scale (OCS; Davis, Flett, & Besser, 2002), the Problematic Mobile Phone Use Scale (MPPUS; Bianchi & Phillips, 2005) and the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ; Broadbent, Cooper, FitzGerald, & Parkes, 1982). Both the OCS and MPPUS were significantly positively correlated to scores on the CFQ. Further analysis revealed a significant difference between high and low scoring groups for both the MPPUS and the OCS and scores on the CFQ, with those in the higher groups presenting greater self reported cognitive failures. The results are interpreted as being symptomatic of individuals in the higher OCS and MPPUS groups as being less resilient to the distractions posed by digital media and technology with a suggested link to lower WMC and AC.

AB  - While the effectiveness of airbags for reducing mortality in avalanche involvements has been examined in various studies, the question of whether the added safety benefit might lead to increased risk-taking - a phenomenon referred to as risk compensation or risk homeostasis - has only been tackled by a few researchers. Building on the existing research on airbags, risk compensation, and stated terrain preferences in winter backcountry recreation, we conducted an extensive online survey including a discrete choice experiment to approach the topic of avalanche airbags and risk compensation from multiple perspectives. Our study sample consists of 163 airbag owners and 243 non-owners mainly from Switzerland, Germany, and Austria. The analyses of the survey responses provide both indirect and direct evidence that risk compensation in response to avalanche airbags is likely within at least certain segments of the recreational backcountry and out-of-bounds skiing population. Initial indirect evidence on risk compensation is provided by examining participants' responses to airbag attitude and use questions using the framework of Hedlund (2000). The stated terrain preferences in our discrete choice experiment with and without airbags indicate that non-owners of airbags might make more aggressive terrain choices when they are given an airbag, whereas the preference patterns of owners did not change when the airbag was taken away from them. Finally, our analysis of avalanche involvement rates with and without airbags offers the most direct evidence that more thrill-seeking backcountry users are taking higher risks when equipped with airbags. The paper concludes with a discussion that highlights that the potential for risk compensation is not a strong argument against the use of avalanche airbags.
Management implications:
If properly used, avalanche airbags are an effective avalanche safety device for reducing the risk of critical burials and death.
Considerable indirect and direct evidence exists that highlights that avalanche airbags likely lead to risk compensation within at least some segments of the recreational backcountry and out-ofbounds skiing population.
Risk-taking in the backcountry is a personal choice, but recreationalists should have the necessary information about the direct and potential indirect effects of safety devices to make informed decisions.
The topic of risk compensation should be included in avalanche awareness courses and discussed in avalanche airbag support documentation and user manuals to increase the awareness of the potential among users.
Additional avalanche accident research should be conducted to better understand the circumstances when the effectiveness of airbags is limited.

AB  - Purpose - The management of unprofitable customer relationships and particularly their abandonment is a topic that has received increasing interest among practitioners and researchers over recent years. Within this manuscript the authors aim to analyze the impact of unprofitable customer abandonment on the abandoning firm's current customers, specifically their exit, voice, and loyalty intentions toward the abandoning firm.
Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on an online experiment conducted among 385 US customers. Respondents were allocated randomly to one of ten conditions (five levels of tie strength x two types of abandonment strategy) and exposed to a scenario describing a customer abandonment decision implemented by a mobile phone provider. The resulting data were analyzed using a combination of analysis of variance (ANOVA) and structural equation modeling.
Findings - The study shows that current customers are significantly more likely to respond actively to unprofitable customer abandonment (exit/voice) than passively through silence and loyalty. Additionally, it shows that increasing satisfaction or switching cost among current customers are unlikely to limit the potential negative consequences of unprofitable customer abandonment. The only variable that drives the choice between exit, voice, and loyalty is the perceived attractiveness of the best alternative relationship.
Originality/value - This work analyzes for the first time how existing customers that the firm would like to retain react toward the news that the company proactively terminates unprofitable customer relationships. Therefore, insight is provided into the likely cost associated with unprofitable customer abandonment - a question that has not been the subject of any empirical study as of today.

AB  - Against the backdrop of alleged mobile phone ubiquity and the enthusiasm about the developmental value of mobile technology, this paper examines the manifestations, drivers, and frictions of mobile phone use in two low- and middle-income settings where mobile technology has diffused rapidly. Qualitative data from 231 participants and survey data from 800 adults in rural Rajasthan and Gansu provide consistent and strong support for the claim that the notion of 'ubiquity' can mislead development practice because it obscures persistent non-use, under-utilisation, and heterogeneous engagement with mobile technology despite its apparently wide accessibility in rural field sites. The paper suggests avenues for further work on the indicators of technology adoption, and it cautions that phone-based development interventions (and their benefits) may diffuse unevenly if the assumption of ubiquitous technology use is violated.

AB  - Until the late twentieth century the letter was still a central form of communication within the private and public spheres and across their somewhat fluid boundary. Not all letters survive but they do have a tangible form and even the epistles of the very ordinary can turn up in a descendant's attic, ripe for socio-historical analysis. This paper explores the shift away from letters and towards email and mobile phone messaging as forms of communication. Two contrasting sources are examined. The first is letters of offer that some young Victorian women wrote presenting their credentials to missionary societies. Although these may have been written largely as statements of religious belief, it is possible to read them as constructions of self and relationship. The second source is interviews with contemporary couples in distance relationships, where the couples discuss their use of email and texting. In particular we examine how these sources illustrate changes in relationship building, some of which may be related to the seemingly more ephemeral nature of digital media. Such an examination questions what constitutes a letter and how important letter writing is as a technique of relationship-building. This technique has clearly been subject to significant change as social relations have become mediated in new ways via the 'anywhere, anytime' (as long as it is now) possibilities of new forms of communication.

AB  - With the emergence of innovative mobile-based tools, new opportunities have been made to enhance the quality of language learning. Keeping this in mind, the current study aimed to investigate the impact of a flipped classroom on enhancing EFL learners’ pragmatic competence. To this end, 60 EFL learners from two universities in Iran were assigned into flipped and conventional groups. In the flipped group, the course materials were posted through Telegram app before the class, and the class time was mostly devoted to communicative activities. To elicit the required data, multiple sources of data collection, including a Discourse Completion Test (DCT), a study log, the teacher's field notes, a Learning Experience Questionnaire (LEQ), a written self-report survey, and a Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) questionnaire, were used. Both parametric and non-parametric statistics were used to analyze the data. The findings revealed that the participants of the flipped group were more engaged with the course contents and significantly outperformed their counterparts in the conventional group in the post-test. The results of the questionnaires suggested that most participants of the flipped group enjoyed learning English in a flipped learning environment, and willingly accepted Telegram as a suitable platform in learning language. The authors present insights into the impact of flipped classrooms on appropriate use of English refusals, the participants' perception of the flipped learning experience, their level of participation inside and outside the class, their impression of the online platform, Telegram, and offer implications for practice.

AB  - As software service platforms grow in number of users and variety of service offerings, it raises the question of how this phenomenon impacts the value obtained by users. This paper identifies system usability, service variety, and personal connectivity to be the major determinants that contribute to the value offered to users on mobile software service platforms. A structural equation model, which is based on utility theory, technology acceptance theory, and the theory of network externalities, has been constructed from seven observed constructs, reflecting the three determinants and the user value. The lower bound of user value is estimated through the user's willingness-to-pay for services and the user's willingness to spend time on using services. For the validation, a co-variance-based structural equation analysis has been conducted on online survey data of 210 users of mobile service platforms (e.g., Android, iOS). The results show that the number of services used and the number of active user connections were found to be the strongest constructs explaining user value. Perceived usefulness did not explain user value as much. In total, they can explain 49 % of the value that the user receives from the platform. The implication of this result is that users' value from a software service platform cannot be explained by the technology acceptance model itself. Instead, an approach that, as used in this research, of integrating network externality theory, utility theory, and technology acceptance theory is necessary.

AB  - Background: Young adults have high rates of tobacco use compared to other subpopulations, yet there are relatively few tobacco interventions specifically targeted to this group. Picture Me Smokefree is an online tobacco reduction and cessation intervention for young adults that uses digital photography and social networking. Objective: The main goal of the project was to determine the feasibility of engaging young adults in participating in user-driven, online forums intended to provide peer support and motivate critical reflection about tobacco use and cessation among this high-use, hard-to-reach population. A related aim was to explore the influence of gender-related factors on participation, in order to determine the need for online interventions to be tailored to the specific gender preferences reflecting young men and women’s participation styles. Methods: A total of 60 young adults ages 19-24 years who self-identified as current cigarette smokers or who had quit within the last year were recruited from across British Columbia, Canada, and participated in an online photo group on Facebook over a period of 12 consecutive weeks. A variety of data collection methods were used including tracking online activity, a brief online follow-up survey, and qualitative interviews with study participants. Data analysis involved descriptive statistics on recruitment, retention, and participation and qualitative (eg, narrative analysis, synthesis of feedback) feedback about participant engagement. Results: Findings from this study suggest good potential for Facebook as an accessible, low-cost platform for engaging young adults to reflect on the reasons for their tobacco use, the benefits of quitting or reducing, and the best strategies for tobacco reduction. Young adults’ frequent use of mobile phones and other mobile devices to access social networking permitted ease of access and facilitated real-time peer-to-peer support across a diverse group of participants. However, our experience of conducting the study suggests that working with young tobacco users can be accompanied by considerable recruitment, participation, and retention challenges. Our findings also pointed to differences in how young women and men engaged the photo-group intervention that should be considered, bearing in mind that in follow-up interviews participants indicated their preference for a mixed gender and 'gender neutral' group format. Conclusions: Tobacco interventions for youth and young adults should be embedded within the existing social networking platforms they access most frequently, rather than designing a stand-alone online prevention or intervention resource. This subpopulation would likely benefit from tobacco reduction interventions that are gender-sensitive rather than gender-specific. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

Concluding that the current practices at the majority of health care facilities in the United States are insufficient, the Council delineated both technical and organizational approaches to protecting electronic health information. The Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center recently implemented a proof-of-concept, Web-based, cross-institutional medical record, CareWeb, which incorporates the NRC security and confidentiality recommendations. We report on our WWW implementation of the NRC recommendations and an initial evaluation of the balance between ease of use and confidentiality.

In addition, the study examines whether there are differences in accessing, reading and interaction behavior between different groups in academia. Using an online survey, which was completed by 416 respondents worldwide, we found that PDF is the most common format for reading, downloading and saving. Despite the advances of technology, most participants prefer to print PDF pages and note, highlight and summarize them manually. Mobile devices such as E-readers, tablets and smart phones are not very popular as means of interaction with scientific literature. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Objective: To compare users' speed, number of entry errors and satisfaction in using two current devices for electronic data collection in clinical research: handheld and laptop computers.
Design: The authors performed a randomized cross-over trial using 160 different paper-based questionnaires and representing altogether 45,440 variables. Four data coders were instructed to record, according to a random predefined and equally balanced sequence, the content of these questionnaires either on a laptop or on a handheld computer. Instructions on the kind of device to be used were provided to data-coders in individual sealed and opaque envelopes. Study conditions were controlled and the data entry process performed in a quiet environment.
Measurements: The authors compared the duration of the data recording process, the number of errors and users' satisfaction with the two devices. The authors divided errors into two separate categories, typing and missing data errors. The original paper-based questionnaire was used as a gold-standard.
Results: The overall duration of the recording process was significantly reduced (2.0 versus 3.3 min) when data were recorded on the laptop computer (p < 0.001). Data accuracy also improved. There were 5.8 typing errors per 1,000 entries with the laptop compared to 8.4 per 1,000 with the handheld computer (p < 0.001). The difference was even more important for missing data which decreased from 22.8 to 2.9 per 1,000 entries when a laptop was used (p < 0.001.). Users found the laptop easier, faster and more satisfying to use than the handheld computer.
Conclusions: Despite the increasing use of handheld computers for electronic data collection in clinical research, these devices should be used with caution. They double the duration of the data entry process and significantly increase the risk of typing errors and missing data. This may become a particularly crucial issue in Studies where these devices are provided to patients or healthcare workers, unfamiliar with Computer Technologies, for self-reporting or research data collection processes.

AB  - Recent work suggests that text messaging impairs simulated and actual driving performance and that this impairment exceeds that of conversing on a cell phone while driving. Additionally, research has shown that text messaging is common in several countries, and despite drivers acknowledging the high risk involved in doing so, drivers continue to engage in this behaviour—regardless of legislation banning it. A nationwide online survey in New Zealand, of 1057 respondents, collected anonymous self-report data regarding the frequency of cell phone use (conversing and text messaging) while driving, beliefs concerning the safety of conversing or text messaging while driving. This article presents part of the results of that study—focusing on text messaging behaviour and risk perception regarding text messaging while driving. Over half of respondents surveyed reported sending or reading between 1 and 5 text messages while driving in a typical week. Despite this, 89% of participants agreed that text messaging while driving in general impairs driving performance. There were no gender differences between the number of text messages read and sent. Age was found to be an important indicator of participant’s willingness to engage in text messaging while driving, with younger drivers more likely to engage in this behaviour. The implications of these findings for future research and countermeasure development are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The number of mobile apps launched in the market has exponentially grown to more than 2 million, but little is known about how users choose and consume apps of numerous categories. This study develops a utility theory-based structural model for mobile app analytics. We use the theoretical concepts of utility and satiation along with the factor analytic approach, as bases in simultaneously modeling the complex relationships among choice, consumption, and utility maximization for consumers of various mobile apps. Using a unique panel dataset detailing individual user-level mobile app time consumption, we quantify the baseline utility and satiation levels of diverse mobile apps and delineate how app preferences and consumption patterns vary across demographic groups affected by persistent use and time trends. The findings suggest that users' baseline utility substantially diverges across app categories and that their demographic characteristics and habit formation explain the appreciable heterogeneity in baseline utility and satiation. These parameters also exhibit positive and negative correlations in mobile websites and app categories. Our modeling approaches and computational methods can unlock new perspectives and opportunities for handling large-scale, micro-level data, while serving as important resources for big data analytics and mobile app analytics.

AB  - Through an experimental design, this article tests the efficiency of various recruitment strategies in a probability sample for a web panel. In order to test the five hypotheses, contact phone, contact SMS, incentives, sponsorship and social proof, the authors conducted a recruitment experiment for a web panel. Five samples each consisting of 500 individuals were drawn from a random sample of 50,000 individuals on the Danish Civil Registration System. Web panels offer a number of advantages and possibilities in studies of public opinion. Recruiting members for such web panels can, however, be a difficult task, and there is a need for more knowledge about the efficiency of different recruitment strategies. The recruitment experiment for our web panel shows that telephone recruitment yields higher recruitment rates than both postal letter and SMS recruitment.

AB  - We explored the relationship between being phubbed by one's peers and selfie liking, and examined the mediating effect of attention seeking and the moderating effect of gender in this relationship. An online survey was conducted with 427 university students. The results reveal that peer phubbing was positively related to attention seeking and selfie liking. Further, attention seeking was positively related to selfie liking, and attention seeking mediated the relationship between peer phubbing and selfie liking. The indirect pathways involved gender differences, with a stronger indirect effect formen compared to that for women. Thus, gender moderated the relationship between peer phubbing and attention seeking, as well as the relationship between attention seeking and selfie liking. These findings illustrate that selfie-related behaviors may function as a buffer for being phubbed. Moreover, phubbed individuals are prone to engage in attention-seeking behavior and frequent selfie liking.

AB  - In this paper we examine the ways in which mobile phones are becoming integrated into the everyday life of older adults in the UK by drawing on research funded as part of the British New Dynamics of Ageing programme. Specifically we draw on a digital engagement survey and the life history narratives of older men and women resident in the East Midlands of England to illuminate the challenges of remaining digitally engaged in old age focusing specifically on mobile phone use, with particular reference to maintaining social connections with spatially dispersed family and friends. Growing numbers of older adults possess a mobile phone, but the degree to which mobile phone use has been integrated into everyday practices is variable. For episodic users a mobile phone is used to complement a landline, to keep in touch with family and friends when out of the house. For confident users the mobile phone is used in multiple ways, via a range of applications, it is an integral part of numerous aspects of everyday life. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to investigate how, where and when parents are mediating their children’s media activities and with which particular device. It also explores whether parents are identifying specific help in this area and questions where they might seek advice (should they need it). Furthermore, it investigates parents’ views regarding a pilot, free online TV channel dedicated to advice through discussion with experts, parents and children. Design/methodology/approach: This small-scale study uses charts and semi-structured interviews to explore the views of parents/carers to better understand lived experiences in relation to mediated digital parenting in the home. The methodology was also designed so that findings will inform further production of relevant content for a video-based resource. Findings: Although this study was limited in duration and scope, the results clearly support earlier research (Livingstone, 2018a, 2018b; Ofcom, 2017) regarding the desperation parents feel through not being able to access appropriate advice in the way they want it. Furthermore, findings provide overwhelming support for the potential benefits of relevant predominantly visually-based online content/ advice. Practical implications: The study raises questions about the empowerment of parents/carers in their own digital skills as a way of transferring confidence to their children, in navigating their way through the educational and social affordances and online safety issues through the use of accessible filmed content. Originality/value: The findings show that issues, such as online safety and related behavioural pressures, remain key for parents and that there is an increasing need for more targeted support and ways to empower parents/grandparents with skills to enhance children’s digital agency. Furthermore, it offers an insight into ways in which styles of ‘‘enabling mediation’’ in the digital age may be analysed and reveals some of the day to day challenges parents face.

AB  - In contemporary life, the mobile phone is integral to digital and material placemaking practices. In this article, drawing on ethnographic analysis conducted in Perth and Melbourne (Australia) in the first months of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, we explore how this relation has been recalibrated as an effect of ?stay-at-home? restrictions. We first provide a brief overview of our methodological and interpretative approach ? drawing from postphenomenology as a useful framework for understanding the mobile?body?place relation and digital placemaking at home. Second, we consider how mobile media are ?situated? in the domestic environment. Third, through an analysis of participant narratives, we explore the concept of net locality (Gordon and de Souza e Silva (2011) through the lens of embodiment theory and suggest that the Covid-19 context has altered our experience of ?networked corporeality?. Finally, we discuss the ambiguity of digital intimacy in the decoupling of mobile media and the body as a result of a rapid increase in both screen time and time spent at home. Throughout the article, we argue that mobile media use in the home is thoroughly enmeshed in the shifting boundaries of privacy, placemaking and domestic space. We question how the placemaking functionality of mobile media, the intimate body?technology relation specific to mobile media practices and ?being-at-home? were subsequently modified by physical distancing and isolation.

AB  - Given the high cost of traditional survey administration (postal mail, phone) and the limits of convenience samples such as university students, online samples offer a much welcomed alternative. Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) has been especially popular among academics for conducting surveys and experiments. Prior research has shown that AMT samples are not representative of the general population along some dimensions, but evidence suggests that these differences may not undermine the validity of AMT research. The authors revisit this comparison by analyzing responses to identical survey questions administered to both a U.S. national sample and AMT participants at the same time. The authors compare the two samples on sociodemographic factors, online experiences, and prosociality. The authors show that the two samples are different not just demographically but also regarding their online behaviors and standard survey measures of prosocial behaviors and attitudes. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for data collected on AMT.

AB  - Background/Context: This study draws on the voluminous research on teachers' workplace orientations and especially on Dan Lortie's documentation of conservatism, individualism, and presentism among teachers. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: This study investigated a school reform network of over 300 secondary schools entitled Raising Achievement Transforming Learning (RATL) to explore the role of the network's interventions in increasing or diminishing presentism. Setting: England. Population/Participants/Subjects: Quantitative performance data were analyzed for all 300 schools. Site visits were made to 10 RATL schools in which educational administrators and teachers were interviewed individually and in focus groups. Additional phone interviews were conducted with administrators in 14 RATL schools. Intervention/Program/Practice: RATL provided a combination of interventions and supports for schools in the network, including data analysis and capacity enhancement; partnering mentor schools with low-performing schools; regional conferences; a Web portal for schools in the project; and a menu of short-, medium-, and long-term strategies for change. Research Design: Qualitative interviews and focus groups of educators in RATL schools, along with secondary analysis of pupil performance data. Conclusions/Recommendations: In Dan Lortie's seminal research on teachers’ workplace orientations, he identified 'presentism,' or short-term thinking, with conservatism and individualism. This research indicates that in the RATL project, individualism among teachers diminished, but this did not diminish either conservatism or presentism. The research identifies three kinds of presentism—endemic, adaptive, and addictive—that have amplified educational conservatism while altering its nature to fit the current culture and political economy of fast capitalism.

AB  - In this case report, the authors describe the implementation of a system for collecting patient-reported outcomes and integrating results in an electronic health record. The objective was to identify lessons learned in overcoming barriers to collecting and integrating patient-reported outcomes in an electronic health record. The authors analyzed qualitative data in 42 documents collected from system development meetings, written feedback from users, and clinical observations with practice staff, providers, and patients. Guided by the Unified Theory on the Adoption and Use of Information Technology, 5 emergent themes were identified. Two barriers emerged: (i) uncertain clinical benefit and (ii) time, work flow, and effort constraints. Three facilitators emerged: (iii) process automation, (iv) usable system interfaces, and (v) collecting patient-reported outcomes for the right patient at the right time. For electronic health record-integrated patient-reported outcomes to succeed as useful clinical tools, system designers must ensure the clinical relevance of the information being collected while minimizing provider, staff, and patient burden.

AB  - Previous studies have defined a new type of impairment in which an able-bodied user's behaviour is impaired by both the characteristics of a device and the environment in which it is used. This behavioural change is defined as a situationally-induced impairment and is often associated with small devices used in a mobile setting or constrained environment. Relatively little is known of its extent or the magnitude of the problems faced by the user. Here, we place the work that has been undertaken into a comparative framework of impairment in the context of data input. Our survey finds that 12 problems exist which define all impaired input and we look to understand the similarities and possible solutions in the new impairment group of small device users. For instance, from the literature, we find that users who are both situationally and motor impaired: press keys more than once, do not use enough force and so a key is not activated, and accidentally type keys in reverse order. A wealth of other errors exist in the motor impaired domain but work does not exist to support their existence in the situational domain. However, if commonalities exist for some - it seems work should be enacted to uncover the commonalities of all. Establishing these possible commonalities is important because solutions from one domain can be leveraged into another thereby saving the need to reinvent interventions which already exist elsewhere.

AB  - Driven by the rapid adoption of Internet-based technologies amongst producers in the Global South, the question of how and whether global value chain arrangements are reconfigured remains open to debate. This article addresses the changing practices of export-oriented smallholders accompanying the transition from simple phone towards smartphone use. Our dynamic approach compares cross-sectional survey data from 2013 and 2017 to answer to what extent Kenyan smallholders have adopted the Internet, which digital practices in relation to agricultural value chains they use and how this affects the inter-firm coordination between smallholders and subsequent actors. Smartphones have gained broad importance for smallholders as they are used for digital practices in value chains. Contrary to the debated dark sides of Internet connectivity, we can however not confirm sweeping digital control or value appropriation by lead firms. So far, long-established, analogue practices widely persist in arrangements between smallholders and exporters. Nevertheless, smartphones are used to nurture multilateral knowledge networks of unprecedented reach and size and further allow for incipient experiments with marketing strategies on digital marketing platforms devoted to domestic markets. We argue that these practices resemble strategic niche seeking that has to be interpreted in relation to captive export arrangements. With qualitatively and quantitatively increasing options to access and share knowledge and to market commodities, the Internet can serve to navigate the multiplicity of chain alternatives (domestic production, informal export production). Such niches should be considered as creating leverage against the take it or leave it deal of captive export production.

AB  - This article explores the ways in which contemporary digital visualization technologies offer grounds for a reappraisal of the relationship between qualitative and quantitative data. Using the example of a 3D digital model of the city of Manchester, the question of descriptive adequacy in the social sciences is addressed.The model is an interesting descriptive device oriented simultaneously to providing an accurate account of what is present in the world and a persuasive image of what that world could become. The analysis asks what kind of descriptive device the 3D model is, and looks at how it exercises its persuasive effects. While attending to how diverse knowledge forms are rendered compatible in the model, the concept of `discontinuous data' is introduced to draw attention to incompatible knowledges that do not appear in the model.The article explores the potential of such models to reconfigure discontinuous data forms and to produce provocative counter-maps.

AB  - The horizontally scrolling format, where text is presented in a single line drifting right to left, is relatively commonly used to display text on digital screens. This format presents a potentially challenging reading situation as the text must be followed smoothly to the left (to track individual words) while rightward eye movements are made as usual to progress through the text. This conflict may reduce attention allocated to upcoming text. Returning to previously encountered text is also more difficult with this format. Here, a sustained reading comprehension task was used to compare performance with horizontally scrolling and multi-line static text formats. Results showed that literal comprehension can be reasonably well maintained with scrolling text, although small decrements are seen at faster scrolling rates. However, they indicated that this format makes it more difficult to answer questions requiring an inference to be made. The contribution of working memory capacity and the impact of display speed on these effects were considered. These findings have implications for the application of this format in digital media and also more widely for the conditions required for successful in-depth reading comprehension with any text format.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate: (1) the effectiveness of wireless handheld computers for online information retrieval in clinical settings; (2) the role of MEDLINE® in answering clinical questions raised at the point of care. Design: A prospective single-cohort study: accompanying medical teams on teaching rounds, five internal medicine residents used and evaluated MD on Tap, an application for handheld computers, to seek answers in real time to clinical questions arising at the point of care. Measurements: All transactions were stored by an intermediate server. Evaluators recorded clinical scenarios and questions, identified MEDLINE citations that answered the questions, and submitted daily and summative reports of their experience. A senior medical librarian corroborated the relevance of the selected citation to each scenario and question. Results: Evaluators answered 68% of 363 background and foreground clinical questions during rounding sessions using a variety of MD on Tap features in an average session length of less than four minutes. The evaluator, the number and quality of query terms, the total number of citations found for a query, and the use of auto-spellcheck significantly contributed to the probability of query success. Conclusion: Handheld computers with Internet access are useful tools for healthcare providers to access MEDLINE in real time. MEDLINE citations can answer specific clinical questions when several medical terms are used to form a query. The MD on Tap application is an effective interface to MEDLINE in clinical settings, allowing clinicians to quickly find relevant citations. © 2007 J Am Med Inform Assoc.

AB  - Smartphones have become ubiquitous in people's lives to an extent that necessitates the investigation of their negative impact. The scarcity of such investigations triggered our interest in examining the relationships among smartphone addiction, anxiety, and family relations. A total of 381 university students participated in an online survey composed of demographic information, the Smartphone Addiction Scale - Short Version, and the Beck Anxiety Inventory. Binary logistic regression analysis and structural equation modelling showed that undergraduate students who had smartphone addiction demonstrated greater odds of having high anxiety compared to those who were not addicted, and students who had high anxiety exhibited greater odds of having clinically significant problems in their family relations. Nevertheless, path analysis showed that anxiety mediated a positive relationship between smartphone addiction and problematic family relations.

AB  - This study aimed to verify whether achieving a distinctive academic performance is unlikely for students at high risk of smartphone addiction. Additionally, it verified whether this phenomenon was equally applicable to male and female students. After implementing systematic random sampling, 293 university students participated by completing an online survey questionnaire posted on the university's student information system. The survey questionnaire collected demographic information and responses to the Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version (SAS-SV) items. The results showed that male and female university students were equally susceptible to smartphone addiction. Additionally, male and female university students were equal in achieving cumulative GPAs with distinction or higher within the same levels of smartphone addiction. Furthermore, undergraduate students who were at a high risk of smartphone addiction were less likely to achieve cumulative GPAs of distinction or higher. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aviation industry continues to experience landing overruns at general aviation airports due in part to pilots touching down beyond the midpoint of the available runway. In some landing overruns, pilots were unaware that the midpoint was reached and nonetheless continued the landing instead of implementing a go-around/aborted landing procedure. Incident reports confirmed that forced landings were coupled with frequent overruns. Over the years airport operators and pilots have occasionally reported that knowing the location of the midpoint of runways would help them to minimize such accidents. There is a greater tendency for landing overruns at airports that primarily serve general aviation operations with runway lengths less than 4,200 ft in length and being utilized by student pilots and those pilots that primarily fly on the weekends only. In order to identify potential markings that could assist in mitigating this risk, the research team evaluated the design for and potential benefits of a marking placed at or near the midpoint of a general aviation runway that would inform pilots of the potential for an overrun/overshoot on a landing. The research team evaluated several preliminary prototype midpoint runway markings using stakeholder input and an online survey of pilots. The best performing marking was further evaluated in an aviation training device study and in field evaluations at six airports. The study results found that the numeric ½ located to the left of the runway centerline provided pilots with useful information on the remaining length of runway.

AB  - 'The way we are now' is an innovative photo-ethnographic project. It originates from both practice led research into creativity, technology and embodied mind funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, and research into well-being, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council. The research into creativity is underpinned by the writings of Merleau-Ponty, including his claim 'that modes of thought correspond to technical methods', and that to use Goethe's phrase 'what is inside is also outside', a position similar to that taken by social anthropologists seeing technology as skilled practice. The research into activity and well-being in daily life uses the experience sampling method (ESM). Traditionally, the method uses questionnaire diaries and electronic pagers which are pre-programmed to bleep at randomly selected times during the day to indicate response times. The research discussed here uses a mobile phone to indicate responses eight times a day for seven consecutive days, extended to include images taken at each signal with the mobile phone/camera, which has not been done before. The research extends both the subject matter of digital fine art, and the portrayal of subjective well-being and quality of life. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - The current study used Orlando, Florida as a case study, and investigated whether there are differences between the three meeting planner types (association, corporate, third party) in regard to destination selection attributes. The study further identified attributes that affect future bookings to Orlando. Data were collected from a nationwide survey of meeting planners with a usable sample of 2,388 completed phone surveys and 118 completed online questionnaires. One significant difference was found between the three meeting planner types. This research was performed in the midst of the recent recession and explored the impact the recession has had on planning meetings. Some effects of the economic downturn on the events industry are decreased attendance and more conservative budgets. Most association meeting planners did not cancel or postponed their events, although all planners agree that attendance to their meetings decreased. Third-party planners seemed to be the most sensitive to budget allocations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Social media have been used by some companies to support customer co-creation in recent years. However, few academic studies have been done to investigate the use of social media in customer co-creation. To understand the current state-of-the-art and future trends about the use of social media in customer co-creation, we conducted two studies to analyze relevant posts on blogs and social media-based online forums. This study reveals some interesting patterns, themes and future trends in this specific area. Recommendations are given to help managers engage in co-creation activities with customers.

AB  - We employ a mixed-methods approach to examine the state of mobile web publishing among U.S. local newspapers. Analysis of the mobile version of news websites (N = 100) across the 50 states yields an uneven picture, with innovation lagging in key areas. A survey with local owner-operators (N = 77) in a large U.S. state suggests that devoting attention to mobile audiences may be associated with revenue opportunities, and the ability to innovate is not necessarily associated with firm size. We explore implications for the viability of local news.

AB  - Parents can influence their children's problematic mobile phone involvement (PMPI) by engaging in parental mediation activities, such as restrictions or co-use, by being a role model, and by their general and domain-unspecific parenting style that facilitates more or less attachment security of the child. This study tested the associations between these different routes of influence-parental mediation of the mobile phone, parental PMPI, and secure child-parent attachment-with children's PMPI. Data was acquired from a quota-sample survey with 500 children, between 8 and 14 years of age, and one of their parents. Results point to the importance of open and empathic parent-child-communication, as well as a positive relationship quality, and demonstrate the detrimental effects of parents' own PMPI on children's PMPI.

AB  - Knowing users' expectations about what they expect on a website and where they expect to find it is crucial for the success of a website. For the last decade, technological advances have entailed major changes in website design but the impact of these changes on users' mental representations of websites remains unclear. In an online study (N = 841), we asked users to sketch their prototypical version of an online shop, a news website and a company page, thereby indicating the interface elements they expect on the website and their expected location. We compared our results to those of a previous study to investigate changes in users' mental representations of websites over time. This comparison suggests that interface elements such as the logo, main content and navigation area are still expected in the same location although others have shifted to the rich footer area at the bottom of the website. In addition, new elements such as links to social networks have been incorporated into users' mental representations whereas other interface elements have disappeared. By providing updated consolidated blueprint models for all three website types, we help designers to create expectation-based websites. Further implications for research and practitioners are discussed.

AB  - Nursing is often associated with providing working-class women a route to upward social mobility. This article argues that although nursing is a relatively open profession, the impact of social class endures, with the main division between nurses who are from higher professional backgrounds and the rest. We utilise the Great British Class Survey (GBCS) to explore nurses’ social origins; the relationship between background and economic, social, and cultural capital; and the impact of origin and capitals on income (and inferred career trajectory). While recognising the methodological limitations of the GBCS, we suggest there may be a ‘class ceiling’ in nursing, and that class advantages are still significant in lower professions of the public sector. Class identification endures regardless of whether nurses have been upwardly or downwardly mobile. We also suggest future directions for intragenerational mobility and gender in social mobility research and make a case for longitudinal and qualitative analysis of nurses’ trajectories. Our findings indicate that the downwardly mobile children of the middle classes retain their classed advantages as they establish their own careers.

AB  - The generation of trajectories for a biped robot is a problem which has been largely studied for several years, and many satisfying offline solutions exist for steady-state walking in absence of disturbances. The question is a little more complex when the generation of the desired trajectories of joints or links has to be achieved or adapted online, i.e. in real time, for example when it is wished to strongly synchronize these trajectories with an external motion. This is precisely the problem addressed in this paper. Indeed, we consider the case where the 'master' motion is measured by a position sensor embedded on a human leg. We propose a method to synchronize the motion of a robot or of other device with respect to the output signal of the sensor. The main goal is to estimate as accurately as possible the current phase along the gait cycle. We use for that purpose a model based on a nonlinear oscillator, which we associate an observer. Introducing the sensor output in the observer allows us to compute the oscillator phase and to generate a synchronized multilinks trajectory, at a very low computational cost. The paper also presents evaluation results in terms of robustness against parameter estimation errors and velocity changes in the input. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Text2Quit, an interactive text-messaging program aimed at smoking cessation, has been shown to increase quit rates, but engagement has not been thoroughly explored. Understanding the program features associated with engagement and behavior change is integral for effective program design. This study explored participants' interaction with the Text2Quit text-messaging program and associations between engagement and smoking cessation. The study included the 262 participants who received the Text2Quit intervention. Self-reported engagement measures, primarily usage of Text2Quit keywords and survey responses, were collected through computer records of participant use. Demographic variables and self-reported smoking abstinence were recorded in surveys at baseline and 6-month assessment. The majority of participants (73%) maintained their subscription during the 6-month intervention. On average, participants received 210.51 text messages, 23.75 emails, and logged into the web portal 1.94 times. Being female was predictive of engagement with the program (β = 15.39). Program engagement, measured by the keyword PLEDGE (p = .002) and the Smokefree Status at 7 Days survey (p < .001) were associated with 6-month abstinence; use of keywords SMOKED (p < .001), RELAPSE (p = .007), and STOP (p = .023) were inversely related to abstinence. While abstainers (N = 83, 31%) stayed enrolled longer and engaged with the program more frequently, program "dose" was not predictive of smoking cessation. Using interactive tools such as pledges and reporting on smoking status were predictive of cessation. Further study of program features is required to understand how to optimally design text messaging programs.

AB  - Background:Many factors affect an individual’s outcomes with a cochlear implant (CI); however, quality of device programming and consistency of follow-up appointments have been shown to be crucial contributors. As audiologists’ CI caseloads increase, time constraints on appointments also increase, thus fueling the need for efficient and effective programming strategies. Currently, there are no standardized guidelines describing what methods should be used during programming, nor are there standardized schedules that delineate what procedures should be performed at specific appointment intervals. Without standardized programming guidelines, clinical practices may be variable and may not align with best practice research; thus, outcomes with a CI, particularly for pediatrics, may not be reflective of the actual potential available. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to identify the clinical practice patterns used by U.S. audiologists when programming and providing follow-up care to children who use CIs. This study aimed to determine the following: common programming approaches, provision intervals for these procedures, common validation assessments, typical follow-up care schedules, and source(s) of CI training. In addition, this study sought to evaluate if training and/or follow-up care differed between small and large CI centers. Research Design: A cross-sectional survey design was used. Study Sample: Target population included practicing audiologists working with pediatric CI users throughout the United States. Participation was voluntary, thus random selection could not be used. A total of 167 participants opened and began the online survey and 113 successfully completed the survey instrument (23.99% return rate). Data Collection and Analysis: Potential participants were identified using the ‘‘find a clinic’’ function on three CI manufacturers’ websites. Potential participants were asked to complete an online survey seeking information about practices they employ in their clinical setting. Survey responses were analyzed for trends. Results: Overall, a common follow-up schedule was determined, which included an average of 6.8 appointments within the first year. Minor differences in training and programming practices between small and large CI centers emerged; however, no statistically significant results were noted. Results did reveal trends in the use of certain clinical practices. This was particularly evident in the limited use of objective measures. Conclusions: Overall, the findings support other recent studies that suggest the development of CI guidelines that may standardize programming and follow-up practices of CI audiologists. This could prove valuable for the continual improvement of CI outcomes, particularly in the pediatric population. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study investigates the effects of cultural orientation and the degree of disdain for robots on the preferred conversational styles in human-to-robot interactions. 203 participants self-reported on questionnaires through a computer-based online survey. The two requesting situations were intended to simulate the participants' interactions with humanoid social robots through an Internet video-phone medium of communication. Structural equation modeling was performed to examine the mediating role of mechanistic disdain between multicultural orientation and conversational constraints. The findings reveal that between the two dimensions of multicultural orientation, only open-mindedness inversely influences mechanistic disdain. Mechanistic disdain, in turn, negatively affects three face-related conversational constraints, thereby leading to a lesser concern for robots' feelings, for minimizing impositions on robots, and for avoiding robots' negative evaluations. The implications of our findings on humans' relations with virtual robot entities and on the future development of humanoid robots are discussed.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to provide evidence regarding the comparability of results provided by two survey methods—a random phone survey and a nonrandom online survey—using the derived importance–performance approach to examine service satisfaction data at the local level. Specifically, we measure whether nonprobability opt-in online survey results produce results that are convergent or divergent to random phone survey results. The findings show that the phone and online survey techniques yield divergent results when simple univariate statistical techniques are employed but produce similar results when the data are analyzed using the more advanced derived importance approach. Though preliminary, the findings suggest that recent advances in the analysis of satisfaction survey data might have the possibility to offset the methodological drawbacks of nonrandom survey techniques such as opt-in online questionnaires. Because of the cost and resource implications of the use of each survey technique, the results hold potentially important lessons for researchers and administrators interested in understanding the costs and benefits of using various survey methods to assess satisfaction with municipal services.

AB  - Social psychology studies how situations and interactions with others affect (often in subtle ways), a person's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. These behavioral, affective, and cognitive outcomes occur in a variety of social contexts with countless possible precursors found in the social environment. As a result of the topic diversity, social psychologists apply a broad array of metrics and use a great deal of creativity in translating hypotheses to a multitude of social contexts. Big data, a new form of data made possible by recent computational advances, has become increasing leveraged by social psychologists to help address existing questions in novel ways. This chapter largely focuses on this special category of newly available information from Web 2.0 Internet and related mobile technologies, which will subsequently be referred to as big data. It presents a categorization that organizes the most commonly used data into smaller overall groups. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In order for organizations to grow and enhance their positioning in a competitive business landscape, senior management should focus on monitoring organizational metrics, especially those related to the organization's profitability. One of the main drivers of financial profitability for an organization is its ability to build and retain its customer base because it is more expensive to attract new customers than it is to retain current customers. Customers expect to be fairly treated and have a pleasant experience when they engage in a business related interaction with an organization. Aside from service quality, customers find service recovery to be the most important factor when making purchasing decisions. Service recovery refers to the actions that an organization takes in response to a service failure. Researchers primarily use a theoretical framework called the organizational justice theory to examine the service recovery paradigm. There are three components which make up the organizational justice theory. These components include procedural justice, distributive justice, and interactional justice. A 2 x 2 x 2 randomized between-subjects factorial experimental design was used to assess the impact a service recovery process has on customer satisfaction, loyalty, and negative word of mouth intentions. Participants played the role of the customer and were provided one of eight uniquely different variations of a fictitious scenario which provided the text of the exchange between a customer and the customer service representative during a service recovery effort. Each scenario, in the form of an online chat transcript, was used to manipulate the independent variables; perspective taking, empathy and problem solving that came in the form of a refund. Each respective scenario was followed by a thirty four item questionnaire measuring the dependent variables; satisfaction, loyalty, and negative word of mouth intentions. Basic participant demographic information (e.g. age and gender) and previous experiences with cell phone providers were also collected. Results indicated that empathy did not produce any main effects, while perspective taking had a main effect on satisfaction and loyalty, and problem solving had a main effect on each of the three dependent variables; satisfaction, loyalty and negative word of mouth intentions. A two-way interaction of perspective taking and empathy and a three-way interaction of perspective taking, empathy and problem solving did not produce any significant effects on how participants responded to satisfaction, loyalty or negative word of mouth intentions. It is unlikely that organizations can solely rely on one specific medium to manage service recovery efforts for a diverse customer base. Therefore, additional research is required to further assess the effects interactional justice and distributive justice have when different communication mediums are used. Such findings can inform how organizations manage their talent, specifically those customer facing employees who manage service recovery processes.

AB  - Migrants’ personal communities are often composed of both local and transnational ties. So far little is known about how transnationality influences the provision of different dimensions of social support in migrants’ personal communities. Structural and relational characteristics of personal communities as well as attributes of egos are seen to explain how social support is provided. The study addresses the question of which dimensions of support are transferred across national borders as well as what structural, relational and ego-attributional constituents of migrants’ personal communities form social support. It presents data on personal communities from an online survey with n = 234 German migrants in Great Britain. The results show that household, local, national and transnational relationships provide a wide array of social support. Though being restricted in the tangible dimensions of social support (instrumental, social companionship), transnational ties provide more intangible (emotional) support. Conflicts are less prevalent in transnational relationships than within the household. Furthermore, the multi-level analysis of the ego-centred network data shows that both structural characteristics of personal communities (size, density) and ego attributes (e.g. age and gender of ego, time of residence in country of residence) are less relevant than relational characteristics (e.g. contact frequency, tie strength and esp. transnationality) in explaining how migrants receive social support. This result challenges a structural approach to the explanation of social support in personal communities of mobile people. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Routine monitoring of depression symptoms and suicide risk is essential for appropriate treatment planning and risk management, but not well implemented by clinicians. We developed a brief online monitoring tool to address this issue. Aims: To investigate whether the online tool can feasibly improve monitoring; whether it is acceptable and useful for young people and their clinicians; and to determine whether a shorter tool could be implemented. Method: In a naturalistic longitudinal cohort study, 101 young people with depression completed the online tool on a tablet, prior to their consultation. Their results were immediately available to their clinician. Clients and clinicians answered questionnaires about acceptability and usefulness. Results: The tool was feasible to implement. Young people and clinicians found the tool acceptable and useful for understanding symptoms and risk. A brief three-item suicidal ideation screening measure correlated well with a validated measure of suicidal ideation. Conclusion: The online tool facilitates the quick exchange of key information about suicide risk, allowing clinicians to immediately address this. This level of responsiveness is likely to improve treatment outcomes. The brief version allows full integration into clinical practice to support clinicians managing those at risk of suicide.

AB  - Cloud computing has been a phenomenon nowadays. The ability to access, store/retrieve and share information anytime, anywhere on the cloud has contributed to the birth of the cloud-based virtual learning environment (c-VLE). Though there are studies conducted on the grid-based VLEs, however due to the significant differences between the two computing technologies; the findings from prior studies may not be germane in the c-VLE context. Unlike the previous studies which studied TAM, UTAUT and their extensions from the perspective of undergraduates and university instructors, this study examined the role of Channel Expansion Theory (CET), VLE related attributes (i.e. interactivity, content design, trust-in-website), school support and knowledge sharing attitude from the perspective of school teachers. Educational level and teaching experience were introduced as the control variables. Data were gathered in two waves of nation-wide surveys with random sampling. The findings revealed significant effects of CET, all VLE related attributes (except content design), school support and attitude towards knowledge sharing on behavioural intention (BI). BI was found to have direct effect on instructional effectiveness (IE). The model explained 68.9%, 62.5% and 28.9% variances in CET, BI and IE. The study provides theoretical and practical implications to the scholars and practitioners. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper examines the experiences of undergraduate university students in response to the employment of video podcasts to support learning and teaching about exotic ecosystems. Six, 15–20-minute podcasts were made accessible to students through a virtual learning environment, either online or to download to mobile technology. The students were free to watch the podcasts whenever and wherever they chose to. The perceived and actual effectiveness of the technology was assessed by written questionnaire, focus groups and summative assessment results. Students agreed that the podcasts were effective in supporting learning and teaching on the course, largely by offering a flexible and visual learning experience. The podcasts were also perceived as a useful resource for revision and assessment, providing visual images that stimulated factual recall and highlighted knowledge gaps. There were no significant differences, however, in examination essay grades comparing cohorts prior to and post adoption of podcasts. The key to improving the student learning experience appears to lie not in adopting new pedagogy, but in reflexively developing the existing pedagogic strategies employed by both teachers and learners. Of primary importance is uniting the individual learning experience of podcasts with group exploration and critical discussion in a collaborative learning framework.

AB  - Research using Internet surveys is an emerging field, yet research on the legitimacy of using Internet studies, particularly those targeting sensitive topics, remains under-investigated. The current study builds on the existing literature by exploring the demographic differences between Internet panel and RDD telephone survey samples, as well as differences in responses with regard to experiences of intimate partner violence perpetration and victimization, alcohol and substance use/abuse, PTSD symptomatology, and social support. Analyses indicated that after controlling for demographic differences, there were few differences between the samples in their disclosure of sensitive information, and that the online sample was more socially isolated than the phone sample. Results are discussed in terms of their implications for using Internet samples in research on sensitive topics. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In many countries across the world, mobile media has become an embedded part of everyday life. And yet, despite the influence of mobile media in and around art, the notion of "mobile art" or "mobile media art" remains relatively undertheorized and discussed. So what constitutes mobile art? Is it defined by a mobile interface in the process or delivery of the artwork? Or is it defined by a relationship to mobile content or context? Located in and around the field of mobile communication, mobile art has often been sublimated with locative, hybrid, mixed reality, or media arts. This paper argues for an understanding of mobile art as a broader field of creative practice than just locative media practice or media arts. Rather than survey all the examples of mobile art on offer today, this paper will structure mobile art into key three thematic rubrics: intimate copresence, emplaced visuality, ambient play.

AB  - Despite the proliferation of mobile personalization worldwide, the research to date is not definitive regarding the effectiveness of personalization on influencing individuals' intentions to use mobile services. The current research examines how an important feature of mobile services-location personalization-affects individuals' intentions to use these services. Specifically, the current research considers two features of location personalization, namely location accuracy and location precision, and examines how individuals' perceptions of these features affect their integrity trust and integrity distrust in the merchant who provides these services, which in turn affect their intentions to use the services. We developed eight hypotheses. To test them, we conducted a field study with a self-developed mobile system that provided personalized lunch venue recommendations. We recruited 236 participants to take part in the field study. After two weeks, they completed a questionnaire to report their perceptions and intentions to use the service. Our results show that the participants' perceptions of location accuracy and location precision positively affected both integrity trust and integrity distrust ( either directly or through moderation by privacy concerns). Integrity trust increases one's intentions to use personalized mobile services, whereas integrity distrust decreases it. This research provides empirical evidence to illustrate the coexistence of integrity trust and integrity distrust-on the one hand, an individual trusts the integrity of a service provider because the service provider is likely to continue keeping its promise of providing genuine personalized mobile services after making a substantial investment in location detection technologies; on the other hand, the individual distrusts the integrity of a service provider because subsequent to this investment, the service provider has a strong incentive to cheat in order to justify the investment.

AB  - Numerous studies have investigated task performance times for selection from hierarchical menus, with structures containing many choices at each of a few levels (broad, shallow structures) generally outperforming structures containing fewer choices at each of many levels (narrow, deep structures). To see if these results applied to blind users who rely on screen reader software for computer access, we replicated an earlier published study, using 19 blind screen-reader users. Consistent with earlier studies, broader, shallow hierarchies outperformed narrow, deep hierarchies. Task performance times and hypertext lostness measures were correlated. Although further work will be needed to understand specific determinants of task performance rates, these results support the use of broad, shallow menus for blind as well as sighted users. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: There are reports of prescription stimulants being purchased online for use as cognitive enhancers or "smart drugs." Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate availability of modafinil and methylphenidate from internet suppliers from the perspective of a typical United Kingdom (UK) based customer. Methods: Using European Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) internet snapshot methodology, we undertook an English language internet snapshot survey in July-August 2018 to gather information on the availability and price of modafinil and methylphenidate from online retailers. Results: A total of 55 modafinil and 14 methylphenidate websites were identified from which the drug could be purchased without a prescription. Minimum purchase quantities ranged from 10 to 90 tablets for modafinil and 1-1,005 tablets for methylphenidate with no apparent upper limit to the number that could be purchased. The price per tablet varied from 0.38-5.31 pound for modafinil and 0.16-5.70 pound for methylphenidate. Free shipping was offered if more than a certain amount was spent on 46 (83.6%) modafinil and 7 (50.0%) methylphenidate websites and discounts were offered on 43 (78.2%) modafinil and 4 (28.6%) methylphenidate websites. Conclusions: Modafinil and methylphenidate are widely available to purchase via internet from the UK without a prescription. The pricing on websites encourages users to buy greater quantities to qualify for discounts and free shipping. The quantities available suggest these purchases may be used in greater amounts than would be legitimately prescribed, increasing the risk of misuse or diversion to other individuals.

AB  - While it is clear that using a mobile device can interrupt real-world activities such as walking or driving, the effects of interruptions on mobile device use have been under-studied. We are particularly interested in how the ambient distraction of walking while using a mobile device, combined with the occurrence of simulated interruptions of different levels of cognitive complexity, affect web search activities. We have established an experimental design to study how the degree of cognitive complexity of simulated interruptions influences both objective and subjective search task performance. In a controlled laboratory study (n = 27), quantitative and qualitative data were collected on mobile search performance, perceptions of the interruptions, and how participants reacted to the interruptions, using a custom mobile eye-tracking app, a questionnaire, and observations. As expected, more cognitively complex interruptions resulted in increased overall task completion times and higher perceived impacts. Interestingly, the effect on the resumption lag or the actual search performance was not significant, showing the resiliency of people to resume their tasks after an interruption. Implications from this study enhance our understanding of how interruptions objectively and subjectively affect search task performance, motivating the need for providing explicit mobile search support to enable recovery from interruptions.

AB  - This study examined relations between a cross-cultural geographically mobile childhood and adulthood cultural homelessness, attachment to cross-cultural identities, and self esteem. Cross-cultural identities are loosely defined identities (e.g., third culture kids, military brats, missionary kids) that describe some individuals' childhood cross-cultural experience. The 475 participants spent at least two years before age 18 in a country different from their parents’ home culture, then returned to the latter. They completed an online survey which included general demographic information regarding cross-cultural experiences in childhood, as well as the Cultural Homelessness Criteria, the Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale, and items that evaluated the strength of affirmation, belonging, and commitment to a self-labeled cross-cultural identity. Cultural homelessness was related to lower self esteem scores; higher affirmation, belonging and commitment to any cross-cultural identity was related to higher self esteem and lower cultural homelessness. Furthermore, such affirmation, belonging, and commitment buffered the cultural homelessness–self esteem association, whereas just having a cross-cultural identity did not.

AB  - The way citizens use technology has changed dramatically in just the last decade; nearly one-third of American adults own tablets, and almost a half own smartphones. But it is not just ownership that is on the rise; citizens are increasingly using such technology to communicate about and participate in politics. The present study utilized a multimethod approach to tap into how technology affects citizens' political behaviors online in the context of the 2012 U.S. Presidential primary season. Compiling survey data with tablet-tracking behavior in a field experiment, results showed that users spent more days with online aggregators (such as Google and Yahoo), recreational sites (like games), and social interaction sites than news and politics. But when they did spend time with news and politics, they spent an average of 10 minutes on each news page, and national/regional news was the most visited subtopic. User-specific descriptive analyses provide portraits of each user's demographic makeup and online political behavior. Finally, we linked user ideology to user behavior through accurate, real-time behavioral observations. Results suggest that participants are more likely to view news from their own ideological perspective than the other, demonstrating evidence for selective exposure. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - This article explores how mobile phones function as an affective technology for young adults, by adapting the self-expansion model to understand attachment to mobile phones. In an online survey, 272 smart phone users reported on their recalled responses to loss/separation from their mobile phone (not by choice), as well as their use of the mobile phone for self-expansion. Results show that self-expansion via mobile phone was associated with greater inclusion of the mobile phone in the self-concept and greater subjective well-being. Most respondents reported negative feelings, such as loneliness/disconnection, anxiety, and boredom, when without their mobile phone, but others felt relieved to be out of touch with others. The use of the mobile phone for self-expansion was associated with more negative emotion and less positive emotion (relief) in response to loss/separation from the phone. Interpretations of the findings are discussed.

AB  - This study examined the use of mobile phones to regulate negative emotions, considering both the role of different aspects of phone use and individual differences in emotion regulation strategies. A total of 287 young adult smartphone users completed an online survey that addressed use of mobile phones for negative emotion regulation. They responded to a phone loss scenario by rating how much they would miss various uses/functions of the phone (which could be involved in emotion regulation). Habitual use of reappraisal to regulate emotion was associated with missing both interpersonal contact and social support, but not access to entertainment/information. In contrast, habitual use of emotion suppression was associated only with missing entertainment/information content. Regulating negative emotions via mobile phone was associated with missing all three uses/functions of the phone, but perception that the phone was effective in remediating negative emotion was associated only with missing social support. Well-being was related to greater use and perceived effectiveness of the mobile phone for emotion regulation. Overall, this study demonstrates that mobile phones can yield psychological benefits, depending on how they are used. Findings suggest that using the phone for social support is most likely to lead to effective remediation of negative emotion. Interpretations and implications of the findings are discussed.

AB  - Experience sampling or ecological momentary assessment offers unique insights into how people think, feel, and behave in their natural environments. Because the method is able to capture situational variation as it happens in ?real time,? experience sampling has become an increasingly popular method in social and personality, psychology, and beyond. With the ubiquity of smartphone ownership and the recent technical advances, conducting experience sampling studies on participants? own devices has become increasingly easy to do. Here, we present one reliable, user-friendly, highly customizable, and cost-effective solution. The web-based application, SurveySignal, integrates the idea of using short message service (SMS) messages as signals and reminders, according to fixed or random schedules and of linking these signals to mobile surveys designed with common online survey software. We describe the method and customizable parameters and then present evaluation results from nine social?psychological studies conducted with SurveySignal (overall N = 1,852). Mean response rates averaged 77% and the median response delay to signals was 8 min. An experimental manipulation of the reminder signal in one study showed that installing a reminder SMS led to a 10% increase in response rates. Next to advantages and limitations of the SMS approach, we discuss how ecologically valid research methods such as smartphone experience sampling can enrich psychological research.

AB  - The study aims to explore effects of navigational augmented reality (AR) apps on the users' perception of their surroundings, and to analyze in which ways these effects are enabled as well as limited by the performance of AR apps on currently available devices. To answer these questions, an exploratory quasi-experiment has been conducted, consisting of three groups of participants, each group differing in their method for obtaining location information as well as the frequency with which this information is consumed. Semistructured pre- and postexperiment interviews with participants, questionnaires that were filled out by the participants after every app usage, and expert interviews with navigational AR app developers are employed in combination with analyzing the effect of augmented reality on the user's perception of space. Surprisingly, it was found that AR users actually became less aware of their surroundings than non-AR navigational app users. This is mainly due to the comparatively worse performance of AR apps on currently available smartphones: The overall quality regularly suffers from a cluttered and confusing presentation, leading to considerable amounts of time spent "deciphering" the layout and functionality of the presented results. Erratic result behavior, caused by frequent movement delays and unexpected lag of the virtual objects further decreases the quality of the overall experience. Finally, some initially unexpected issues related to the social acceptability of augmented reality app usage in public places were encountered during the experiment, which are explained by the physically very involved method of interacting with AR apps, namely having to point and hold the device into the direction information is being sought over. Nevertheless, augmented reality was found to have a number of distinct advantages over other navigational apps, namely the ability to improve the users' understanding of proximity, directions, and spatial relations.

AB  - The study examined the use of computer-mediated communication (CMC) among individuals involved in a conflict sparked by the appointment of an administrator as president-designate of Gallaudet University in 2006. CMC was defined as forms of communication used for transmitting (sharing) information through networks with digital devices. There were 662 survey respondents. Respondents reported overwhelmingly (98%) that they used CMC to communicate. Students and alumni reported CMC use in larger proportions than any other group. The favorite devices among all respondents were Sidekicks, stationary computers, and laptops. Half of all respondents also reported using some form of video device. Nearly all reported using e-mail; respondents also identified Web surfing, text messaging, and blogging as popular CMC activities. The authors plan another article reporting on computer and electronic technology use as a mechanism connecting collective identity to social movements.

AB  - Technological advancements and changes in online survey participation pave the way for new data collection methods. Particularly, the increasing smartphone rate in online surveys facilitates a re-consideration of prevailing communication channels to, for instance, naturalize the communication process between researchers and respondents and to collect more in-depth and high-quality data. However, so far, there is a lack of information on whether respondents are willing to undergo a change in communication channels. In this study, I therefore investigate respondents' willingness to participate in online surveys with a smartphone to have the survey questions read out loud (audio channel) and to give oral answers via voice input (voice channel). For this purpose, I employed two willingness questions - one on audio and one on voice channels - in the probability-based German Internet Panel (N = 4,426). The results reveal that a substantial minority of respondents is willing to participate in online surveys with a smartphone to have the survey questions read out loud and to give oral answers via voice input. They also show that the device used for survey participation and personality traits, such as conscientiousness and extraversion, play a role when it comes to respondents' willingness.

AB  - Participation in web surveys via smartphones increased continuously in recent years. The reasons for this increase are a growing proportion of smartphone owners and an increase in mobile Internet access. However, research has shown that smartphone respondents are frequently distracted and/or multitasking, which might affect completion and response behavior in a negative way. We propose 'SurveyMotion (SMotion)', a JavaScript-based tool for mobile devices that can gather information about respondents' motions during web survey completion by using sensor data. Specifically, we collect data about the total acceleration (TA) of smartphones. We conducted a lab experiment and varied the form of survey completion (e.g. standing or walking). Furthermore, we employed questions with different response formats (e.g. radio buttons and sliders) and measured response times. The results reveal that SMotion detects higher TAs of smartphones for respondents with comparatively higher motion levels. In addition, respondents' motion level affects response times and the quality of responses given. The SMotion tool promotes the exploration of how respondents complete mobile web surveys and could be employed to understand how future mobile web surveys are completed.

AB  - The increased use of smartphones in web survey responding did not only raise new research questions but also fostered new ways to research survey completion behavior. Smartphones have many built-in sensors, such as accelerometers that measure acceleration (i.e., the rate of change of velocity of an object over time). Sensor data establish new research opportunities by providing information about physical completion conditions that, for instance, can affect response quality. In this study, we explore three research questions: (1) To what extent do respondents accept to comply with motion instructions? (2) What variables affect the acceleration of smartphones? (3) Do different motion levels affect response quality? We conducted a smartphone web survey experiment using the Netquest opt-in panel in Spain and asked respondents to stand at a fix point or walk around while answering five single questions. The results reveal high compliance with motion instructions, with compliance being higher in the standing than in the walking condition. We also discovered that several variables, such as the presence of third parties, increase the acceleration of smartphones. However, the quality of responses to the five single questions did not differ significantly between the motion conditions, a finding that is in line with previous research. Our findings provide new insights into how compliance changes with motion tasks and suggest that the collection of acceleration data is a feasible and fruitful way to explore survey completion behavior. The findings also indicate that refined research on the connection between motion levels and response quality is necessary.

AB  - The use of agree/disagree (A/D) questions is a common technique to measure attitudes. For instance, this question format is employed frequently in the Eurobarometer and International Social Survey Programme (ISSP). Theoretical considerations, however, suggest that A/D questions require a complex processing. Therefore, many survey researchers have recommended the use of item-specific (IS) questions, since they seem to be Less burdensome. Parallel to this methodological discussion is the discussion around the use of mobile devices for responding to surveys. However, until now, evidence has been lacking as to whether the use of mobile devices for survey response affects the performance of established question formats. In this study, implemented in the Netquest panel in Spain (N = 1,476), we investigated the cognitive effort and response quality associated with A/D and IS questions across PCs and smartphones. For this purpose, we applied a split-ballot design defined by device type and question format. Our analyses revealed longer response times for IS questions than A/D questions, irrespective of the device type and scale length. Also, the IS questions produced better response quality than their A/D counterparts. All in all, the findings indicate a more conscientious response to IS questions compared to A/D questions.

AB  - Political knowledge can affect measures obtained in public opinion research and political science. When asked political knowledge questions, some respondents look up the answers online, inflating political knowledge scores. This response behavior is detectable in web surveys using paradata. This study investigates whether and to what extent respondents switch away from the survey to search for answers online using JavaScript OnBlur functions. Respondents were randomly assigned to device types (PC or smartphone) and response formats (open or closed) and answered a self-report question. The results reveal that about 30 percent of the respondents look up answers, depending on the device type and response format. They also reveal that switching away and correct answers are significantly associated with the response format. These findings provide new insights on looking up answers online and show that paradata are a promising new method to detect response behavior that may lead to incorrect inferences about respondents' political knowledge. The findings also show that paradata and self-reports complement each other and that both measures should be combined in future web surveys measuring political knowledge. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - PurposeThe purpose of the study is to assess the usability and acceptability of FallCheck, a Web app that allows users to complete home-hazard assessments within their own home, with a group of people at risk of falling and their carers.Design/methodology/approachThis mixed method study used an online survey followed by semi-structured telephone interviews to collect both qualitative and quantitative data. A Think-Aloud study was used to test usability of the Web app through structured tasks.FindingsFindings showed that FallCheck was easy to use with few usability issues. The Web app was deemed appropriate to use by people at risk of falling (young or old) or by carers if appropriate. The depth of knowledge provision and breadth of content was acceptable, and many participants reported subsequently making changes to their home environment to reduce their risk of falling. Overall, the majority of participants reported feelings of improved confidence and safety with an increased awareness of fall risks and a reduction in fear of falling at home.Practical implicationsFallCheck has good acceptability and usability with people at risk of falling and their carers and has the potential to improve access to home-hazard assessment and affect behavioural change regarding fall risk hazards and behaviour.Originality/valueThis study describes successful use of an app that may be helpful in identifying home-hazards and making changes to reduce risk of falls, particularly in the absence of occupational therapy intervention and has the potential for integration into falls care pathways.

AB  - With the emergence of flexible display technologies, it will be necessary for interface designers to move beyond flat interfaces and to contextualize interaction in an object's physical shape. Grounded in early explorations of organic user interfaces (OUIs), this paper examines the evolving relationship between industrial and interaction designs and examines how not only what we design is changing, but how we design too. First, we discuss how (and why) to better support the design of OUIs: how supporting sketching, a fundamental activity of many design fields, is increasingly critical and why a 'hypercontextualized' approach to their design can reduce the drawbacks met when everyday objects become interactive. Finally, underlying both these points is the maturation of technology to that of a computational material; when interactive hardware is seamlessly melded into an object's shape, the 'computer' disappears and is better seen as a basic design material that, incidentally, happens to have interactive behavior. © 2013 The Author.

AB  - The dual pathway model proposes that trait body dissatisfaction leads to bulimic symptoms via two distinct pathways: dieting and trait negative affect As many of these modelled variables have state-based equivalents, the present study evaluated the generalisability of this model to predict associations between state body dissatisfaction and instances of disordered eating. 124 women aged 18 to 40 years completed an online survey (accessed via a mobile phone device with web access) over a 7-day period. The mobile phone device prompted participants at random intervals seven times daily to self-report their state body dissatisfaction, current mood experiences, dieting attempts, and disordered eating practices. Multi-level mediation modelling revealed that both negative mood states and dieting significantly mediated the state body dissatisfaction-disordered eating relationships, although the strength of these associations depended on the aspect of disordered eating measured and individual differences in trait body dissatisfaction, internalization of appearance standards, tendency towards dieting, and BMI. Collectively, these results not only support adapting the dual pathway model to the state-level, but also suggest that several of the model implied pathways may be more relevant for individuals with more pathological eating- and body-related concerns and behaviours.

AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to examine the extent to which line officers in police agencies can identify digital evidence at crime scenes, also known as the binary artifacts stored on computers, mobile devices, tablets and the internet, through an analysis of survey responses of line staff in a Midwestern state police agency.Design/methodology/approachAn electronic survey was completed by 258 respondents using a scenario-based vignette asking them to identify where such evidence may be located during a fictitious call for service.FindingsMost all respondents identified appropriate devices and locations where digital evidence may be stored on suspects and victims in a scenario call for service. There were significant differences in responses on the basis of recent field experience with digital evidence.Research limitations/implicationsThe findings demonstrate the importance of experiential learning and training for line staff in police agencies to prepare them for basic digital evidence handling in the field. This sample is, however, based on a single state police agency and may not be reflective of other similarly sized agencies. Future research is needed to replicate this study and expand the generalizability of these findings.Originality/valueFirst responders should be able to identify and secure all appropriate forms of evidence at crime scenes, regardless of crime type, while awaiting specialized investigators. This study is one of the first to consider when and how police are able to recognize digital evidence at crime scenes.

AB  - The convergence of telecommunications, media, and computing represented by the iPhone has been a dream come true for consumers. For policy makers, however, it has created a nightmare. Policy has been outpaced by technological and industrial advances, as regulators are struggling to accommodate a digital and convergent media landscape. Convergence is a concept that has been active in regulatory discourse since the 1960s. Forty-five years later, the regulatory and policy questions have yet to be resolved. The arrival of the Internet and subsequent accelerated convergence of distribution technologies has created a much larger 'regulatory hangover'—the inability of policy to keep pace with technological developments. This disconnect has become particularly pronounced in the language and concerns of media policy, where technology has transformed communications industries and, in turn, wreaked havoc on the foundational rationales for many regulatory paradigms. This chaos presents pressing economic, technological, and cultural dilemmas about regulation in an era of convergence. Among them: How should regulators treat a device that contains as many platforms, paradigms, and services as the iPhone? How will the battles over the Internet's regulatory classification affect the future of the iPhone and similar devices? How do contemporary regulatory politics determine the ways in which services on the iPhone will be classified and regulated in the future? This chapter will address these dynamics by examining the historical trajectory of regulating broadband networks and the role that the iPhone has played in reconceptualizing the importance of platforms and devices to the pipelines that service them.

AB  - Cross-sectional studies have documented a positive association between academic procrastination and problematic mobile phone use (PMPU). However, the specific predictive direction has remained controversial and the potential mechanisms underlying the association have not been rigorously evaluated. According to Davis's cognitive-behavioral model, Brand et al.'s I-PACE model, and procrastination-related theories, academic procrastination and PMPU might have a reciprocal relationship and distraction cognitions might play a mediating role in this process. A total of 633 secondary school students completed three self-report questionnaires at three 6-month intervals over the course of 1.5 years. The cross-lagged panel model results showed that earlier academic procrastination positively predicted subsequent PMPU over time, but the reverse prediction was not stable. Furthermore, distraction cognitions played a mediating role in linking earlier academic procrastination and subsequent PMPU. These findings indicate that academic procrastination precedes PMPU with distraction cognitions as a potential mediator, which contributes to clarifying the controversial relationship and explicating the underlying mechanism. Overall, interventions for academic procrastination may be effective in reducing maladaptive cognitions associated with mobile phones and preventing adolescents from developing PMPU.

AB  - The two main tasks of a smart TV GUI are menu navigation and free pointing. Traditional remotes with directional keys are suitable for menu navigation but may not be so for free pointing. More recent remotes with a two-dimensional (2D) pointing device are suitable for free pointing but may not be so for menu navigation. To support both types of tasks well, we devised a new input device called TouchRoller. We expect that it can support both types of tasks well because it has a separable control structure and a continuous input property. A comparative user study showed that the performance of TouchRoller is comparable to that of directional keys for menu navigation and 2D pointing devices for free pointing. In addition, it was most favored by the participants, and NASA TLX test results showed that TouchRoller demands the lowest task load.

AB  - This study explores the effects of Internet self-efficacy and search task specificity on the self-efficacy outcome and task perseverance of finding online health-related sites that contain attributes of website accountability, as established by the American Medical Association (AMA). In a mixed 2 (self-efficacy) x 2 (search task specificity) repeated-measures experimental design, participants conducted two search tasks (general and specific) that varied in the amount of task difficulty. When search task specificity was taken into account, there was an Internet self-efficacy and task specificity interaction according to which high Internet self-efficacy participants locate sites higher in website accountability in the general search task (the more difficult search task) than their low self-efficacy counterparts. There was no significant difference in website accountability for the specific search task (the less difficult task). High Internet self-efficacy participants also demonstrated more task perseverance than their low Internet self-efficacy counterparts. © 2006 Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication.

AB  - Shyness has been reported to be closely associated with problematic mobile phone use, yet the underlying mechanism which may mediate or moderate this relationship remains obscure. Based on the cognitive-behavioral model of pathological internet use, combined with the theory of compensatory internet use and self-determination theory, the current study aimed to examine the association between shyness and problematic mobile phone use and the mediating role of social anxiety, as well as the moderating role of relatedness need satisfaction perceived on the mobile phone. A sample of 1050 Chinese adolescents recruited from middle schools completed the questionnaires. Mediation analysis revealed that social anxiety could partially mediate the relationship between shyness and problematic mobile phone use. Furthermore, moderated mediation analysis indicated that shyness could exacerbate problematic mobile phone use through social anxiety for adolescents with a higher level of relatedness need satisfaction from the mobile phone compared to a lower level of need satisfaction. Overall, these findings advance the understanding of how and when shyness leads to problematic mobile phone use. Implications for research on mobile phone use are discussed.

AB  - The proliferation of smartphones and mobile communication has enabled users to capture images or videos and share them immediately on social networking and messaging platforms. Unfortunately, these platforms are also used to manipulate the masses by performing social engineering attacks by sharing fabricated images (or videos). These attacks cause public shame, ethnic violence and claim lives. With the rise of advanced image processing tools, the deep fakes are automated, and their implications are boundless. In this article, we discuss different types of modification of images/videos and survey the corresponding methods and tools. We also highlight the ongoing efforts to detect fake images and videos using advanced machine learning tools and fact-checking. Along with these tools, we also need different complementary approaches discouraging the production and propagation of manipulative forged images and videos on the Internet. This paper further emphasizes that we desperately need socio-technological solutions that empower end-users with the right tools to make an informed moral decision while producing, uploading, and sharing media. Finally, supporting this, we discuss a holistic blockchain-based solution.

AB  - The quality of a group decision depends on its members sharing and adopting their various perspectives. Multi-criteria models provide an appropriate vehicle for managing this information sharing because they break down the decision into small, single-issue questions that can be treated independently. We present a new lexicographic decision method with three equivalence classes for use by a group. Our algorithm is the first to combine the hidden profile and multi-criteria paradigms and thereby improving the consensus by identifying critical disagreements and inviting the decision makers to share their mental models of them. A computer simulation demonstrates the algorithm's effectiveness and efficiency. Unless the problem parameters are very unfavorable, the method achieves the desired choice set or a close approximation to it significantly faster than the commonly used compensatory methods. Our algorithm can either provide step-by-step instructions to a human facilitator, or it can be implemented as a software agent acting as a fully automated digital facilitator, allowing decision makers to participate "on the go" using their internet-connected mobile devices.

AB  - Several experiments have documented how older adults have greater difficulty using input devices than young adults. None of these experiments, however, have provided information on the challenges faced by older adults when using pens to interact with handheld computers. To address this need, we conducted a study comparing the performance of twenty 18-22 year olds, twenty 50-64 year olds, and twenty 65-84 year olds conducting selection and steering tasks. We found that for the most part, older adults were able to complete tasks accurately and efficiently. An exception occurred with the low accuracy rates achieved by 65-84 year old participants when tapping on targets of the same size as the standard radio buttons on the PocketPC. An alternative selection technique we refer to as "touch" enabled 65-84 year olds to select targets significantly more accurately. If tapping to select, making standard-sized targets 50% larger provided 65-84 year olds with similar advantages to switching to "touch" interactions. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - During the course of this paper we mobilise an ideal typical framework that identifies three waves of reduction within contemporary qualitative inquiry as they relate to key aspects of the sociological tradition. The paper begins with a consideration of one of sociology's key questions; namely how is social organisation possible? The paper aims to demonstrate how this question moves from view as increased specialisation and differentiation in qualitative methodology within sociology and related disciplines results in a fragmentation and decontextualisation of social practices from social orders. Indeed, the extent to which qualitative methods have been detached from sociological principles is considered in relation to the emergence of a reductionist tendency. The paper argues that the first wave is typified by conceptual couplings such as ?discourse and the subject?, ?narrative and experience?, ?space and place? and the second by ?activity type couplings? such as ?walking and talking? and ?making and telling? and then, finally, the third wave exemplified through auto-ethnography and digital lifelogging. We argue each of these three waves represent a series of steps in qualitative reduction that, whilst representing innovation, need to reconnect with questions of action, order and social organisation as a complex whole as opposed to disparate parts.

AB  - Disability is an important characteristic to consider in survey research. However, people with disabilities are a hard-to-reach population. Internet survey methods offer tremendous potential to expand researchers’ ability to reach and learn about people with disabilities. The goal of this study is to examine potential bias when using nonprobability Internet samples to investigate demographics and socioeconomic outcomes of people with disabilities. We compare the findings based on a national employment and disability survey instrument fielded to four samples: (1) a random-digit dial (RDD) sample, (2) a prescreened sample from a nonprobability Internet access panel, for which screening was based on the presence of 139 previously reported health conditions, (3) an unscreened sample from another nonprobability Internet access panel (without previously prescreened health conditions), and (4) a mixed nonprobability self-recruited (river and snowball) sample. Each sample was weighted on four demographic variables (gender, age, race/ethnicity, and region) using benchmarks from the American Community Survey (ACS). Three dichotomous outcome variables of interest (level of education, household income, and current employment status) were contrasted with weighted population estimates from the ACS. Results showed that the sample resulting from the RDD and all three nonprobability Internet samples differed significantly from ACS population estimates on all three outcome variables. Reweighting to include type of functional disability did not significantly reduce dissimilarities with ACS for any of the four samples. Nonprobability Internet survey methods offer relatively low-cost, easy-to-use avenues for disability-related research. Yet, researchers must proceed with caution to reduce or avoid known sources of bias in both the methodology and the interpretation of results.

AB  - Cyberpsychology is a recently emergent field that examines the impact of technology upon human cognition and behavior. Given its infancy, authors have rapidly created new measures to gauge their constructs of interest. Unfortunately, few of these authors have had the opportunity to test their scales' psychometric properties and validity. This is concerning, as many theoretical assumptions may be founded upon scales with inadequate attributes. If this were found to be true, then previous findings in cyberpsychology studies would need to be retested, and future research would need to shift its focus to creating psychometrically sound and valid measures. To provide inferences on this concern, the current study examines the article reporting, scale creation, and scale reliabilities of every article published in Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking from its inception to July 2014. The final data set encompassed the coding of 1,478 individual articles, including 921 scales, and spanning 17 years. The results demonstrate that the simple survey methodology has become more popular over time. Authors are gradually applying empirically tested scales. However, self-created measures are still the most popular, leading to concerns about the measures' validity. Also, the use of multi-item measures has increased over time, but many articles still fail to report adequate information to assess the reliability of the applied scales. Lastly, the average scale reliability is 0.81, which barely meets standard cutoffs. Overall, these results are not overly concerning, but suggestions are given on methods to improve the reporting of measures, the creation of scales, and the state of cyberpsychology.

AB  - With the rapid development of mobile communications technologies, social apps (e.g., Line, WeChat) have emerged as important communication tools. Although social apps provide people with additional convenience, overuse of such applications may have negative life effects, such as technostress and distraction. Past research has indicated that personality attributes contribute to compulsive usage. This study explores the relationships between personality attributes and compulsive usage of social apps, and examines the impact of technostress on academic performance. A total of 136 valid questionnaires were collected from university students through an online survey. Fourteen proposed hypotheses were examined using SmartPLS software. The results indicate that extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism have significant effects on compulsive usage of mobile social applications. Compulsive usage had a significant positive impact on technostress but did not negatively affect academic self-perception and course grades. In addition, conscientiousness significantly influenced academic self-perception. Unexpectedly, gender and number of friends had little influence on technostress or compulsive usage. The implications of these findings are discussed and directions for future research are offered. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This research proposes a post-acceptance model of mobile movie-themed games (MMGs) from the perspective of experiential marketing with five experiential elements of MMGs: thematic attractiveness, perceived enjoyment, flow, act, and relate. The online survey method with structural equation modeling was used to empirically examine the proposed model. A total of 388 valid questionnaires from actual MMG users were collected. The potential gender differences were also investigated. The results present three theoretical contributions: (1) loyalty to movie games can be determined by flow, act, and relate; (2) movie-watching intention can be predicted by thematic attractiveness, perceived enjoyment, act, and relate; and (3) gender differences have been found in some theoretical relationships. Further managerial implications are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study seeks to assess the implications of the social use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) for online political participation. Past research investigating the link between ICTs and political participation has emphasized the informational use of ICTs, overlooking their communication-enabling potentials for facilitating political talk in interpersonal spaces and subsequently, political participation in public domains. To understand further how ICTs as a means of communication may relate to political participation, we use data from the 2008 Taiwan Social Change Survey (N=1076) to examine the relationship between the Internet and online political participation by looking at online media use for social interaction and engagement in civic talk online. Our findings suggest that interpersonal factors such as online civic talk and media multiplexity are positively associated with online political participation. Individuals who discuss politics with their friends via the Internet and those who use more types of online media for social interaction are more likely to contact legislators and elected officials directly via the Web and articulate their political thoughts in online public spaces such as forums, blogs, and websites of news media. We further offer an assessment of the findings' implications for political participation, political communication, and digital inequality.

AB  - This research cross-employed the social cognition theory (SCT) and the analytical network process (ANP) model in qualitative analyses and the multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) methodology in quantitative measurements to comprehensively re-identify the most critical information communication technology (ICT) determinants in minimizing the digital divide (DD). After measuring the complete importance of related priority weight w (eigenvector) from the survey results given to various experts, the complete synthetically comparative index numbers (SCIN) from the evaluation model used conveyed two distinct consequences. First, the highest SCIN scores for the ANP, F-ANP, and G-ANP models are 0.5516, 0.3771, and 0.4791, respectively, and are located in the "ICT can positively minimize the level of DD" (ICTCPMDD) column in the summarized results table. Secondly, the highest evaluated weighted score of assessed criteria of 0.5801 is located in the Diversified Mobile Applications (DMAPP) column. From these results, there are two contributive findings that can be deduced. First, ICT indeed proved the determinative influences and interplays in the level of DD which means that the undeveloped, developing, and emerging regions are apparently able to minimize the level of DD by means of the ICT development. Second, the Diversified Mobile Applications (DMAPP) is the most critical determinant of ICT in minimizing the level of digital divide.

AB  - This research investigates the impact of service failure severity on consumers' negative emotion (anger) and coping behaviors (revenge and avoidance) in the context of mobile application service failure. It also identifies the moderating role of technology anxiety on the relationship between service failure severity and blame attribution. The sample for this study consisted of users who had experienced a mobile application service failure in Taiwan. This study distributed online surveys to potential respondents via MySurvey, an online survey distribution platform. Seven hundred and thirty-one mobile application users participated in this study. This study adopted Structural Equation Modeling to test the research hypotheses. The results showed that service failure severity positively affected blame attribution and, thus, amplified the anger of negative emotion. Revenge and avoidance occurred. Technology anxiety had a moderating effect on the relationship between service failure severity and blame attribution.

AB  - While many reports predict huge growth potential for the mobile application (app) market, little is known about user intention to purchase paid apps. This study amends the expectation confirmation model and incorporates app rating, free alternatives to paid apps and habit as belief-related constructs to predict user behavior. The proposed model was empirically evaluated using a survey of 507 respondents about their perceptions of app usage. The results indicated that confirmation was positively related to perceived value and satisfaction. Value-for-money, app rating and free alternatives to paid apps were found to have a direct impact on intention to purchase paid apps. Specifically, there was a significant difference between potential users and actual users. The results may provide further insights into app marketing strategies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - As an important part of the public service and educational infrastructures for national culture and heritage culture, a virtual museum presents the user experience of a real museum, with visitors, educators, and tourists interacting with the prepared digital culture contents by a mouse, touch panel, and other augmented reality devices. The goal of virtual museum is to help students and visitors to move around the virtual museum space freely and generate experience and satisfaction from the fruition of cultural heritage anytime, anywhere, and from any device. This study presents a hybrid three-dimensional virtual museum based on panoramic images and three-dimensional models. A technical framework of hybrid three-dimensional virtual museum is proposed on the basis of a typical three-tier architecture, which includes the data layer, technique supporting layer, and application layer. A hybrid three-dimensional data organization approach with geo-referenced sequence panoramic images and three-dimensional models is designed to build the data layer of hybrid three-dimensional virtual museum. A three-dimensional scene of geo-referenced sequence panoramic images and three-dimensional models is created in real time using Unity three-dimensional and web service under the mobile Internet environment for hybrid three-dimensional virtual museum. The different applications of hybrid three-dimensional virtual museum based on the data layer and technique infrastructure are designed to achieve handheld virtual museum guidance and navigation, three-dimensional browsing, and heritage culture information query for visitors with smartphones to access anytime and anywhere. As an example, a hybrid three-dimensional virtual museum application for Jinsha Archaeological Site Museum is developed with the proposed approach. The geo-referenced sequence panoramic images of museum galleries, together with three-dimensional models of cultural relics, can integrate seamlessly to a three-dimensional reality-based museum space where users can move around the space actively and freely with all kinds of personal computer and smartphone clients.

AB  - Purpose: This paper adopts a response hierarchy model to examine drivers’ intrinsic and extrinsic motivations for using mobile digital television (MDTV) while on the move. Design/methodology/approach: The study used a regional quota sampling method to examine the viewing habits of drivers who have a mobile digital television installed in their vehicles and was carried out in two steps. The first stage had interviews with eight car stereo distributors, and the second stage used a questionnaire to ascertain the viewing habits and content selection of drivers watching TV in their vehicles. Findings: SEM analysis of a survey of 480 MDTV-using drivers in Taiwan revealed an enjoyment-based model of MDTV use since enjoyment has the most significant effect on drivers’ affect, intention to use, and use behavior. Perceived ease of use and subjective norms had a lesser effect. The nonsignificant effect of concentration and perceived risk imply that while drivers enjoy watching MDTV, they do not believe they switch their primary attention from driving to programs. Since drivers do not think they concentrate on watching MDTV, program content has little chance to induce curiosity and increase viewing time, the real communicative effect of watching TV while driving must be sharply discounted. Research limitations/implications: The paper focuses exclusively on use of front-seat MDTV equipment by drivers, and does not attempt to examine MDTV use by other passengers in the same vehicle. Originality/value: This is the first study that has been undertaken of mobile digital television viewers, and the paper will be useful as a reference for those who are developing the mobile digital television market as they work to understand the needs and viewing habits of their audience.

AB  - Objective The high level of stress associated with caring for others with medical conditions has been recognized for some time. Reducing caregiver stress can improve caregiver quality of life as well as improve the care they provide to loved ones. This systematic review assesses the effectiveness of internet-based interventions to decrease caregiver stress. Materials and methods A comprehensive literature search of Ovid MEDLINE (1946-2013), Embase (1988-2013), PsycINFO (1987-2013), and CINAHL was conducted using terms related to caregiver and internet-based interventions. Internet-based interventions involving informal caregivers in an open-label or randomized controlled trial setting were included. A pair of raters independently reviewed all published abstracts. Data regarding participants, interventions, and outcomes were extracted and, for randomized trials, methodology quality was also reviewed. Results Eight open-label trials met the review criteria: three showed positive benefit in reducing caregiver stress, four were partially positive (some outcomes positive, others negative), and one was a negative study. Sixteen randomized trials met the review criteria: six showed positive benefit, five were partially positive, and five were negative. There were no clear patterns as to the variables (such as study duration and complexity of intervention) associated with better outcomes, although earlier studies typically had more negative outcomes. Discussion Internet-based interventions were mostly effective in reducing aspects of caregiver stress and improving their well-being. Further studies to assess outcomes for caregivers and their recipients' health, different technology delivery methods, and the cost of such interventions are needed.

AB  - Because mobile virtual reality (VR) is both mobile and immersive, three-dimensional (3D) visualizations of disaster scenes based in mobile VR enable users to perceive and recognize disaster environments faster and better than is possible with other methods. To achieve immersion and prevent users from feeling dizzy, such visualizations require a high scene-rendering frame rate. However, the existing related visualization work cannot provide a sufficient solution for this purpose. This study focuses on the construction and optimization of a 3D disaster scene in order to satisfy the high frame-rate requirements for the rendering of 3D disaster scenes in mobile VR. First, the design of a plugin-free browser/server (B/S) architecture for 3D disaster scene construction and visualization based in mobile VR is presented. Second, certain key technologies for scene optimization are discussed, including diverse modes of scene data representation, representation optimization of mobile scenes, and adaptive scheduling of mobile scenes. By means of these technologies, smartphones with various performance levels can achieve higher scene-rendering frame rates and improved visual quality. Finally, using a flood disaster as an example, a plugin-free prototype system was developed, and experiments were conducted. The experimental results demonstrate that a 3D disaster scene constructed via the methods addressed in this study has a sufficiently high scene-rendering frame rate to satisfy the requirements for rendering a 3D disaster scene in mobile VR.

AB  - The under-reporting of public safety incidents is a long-standing issue. In this paper, we propose a computational cognitive modeling approach to understand and design a mobile crowdsourcing system for improving campus safety reporting. In particular, we adopt drift-diffusion models (DDMs) from cognitive psychology to investigate the effect of various factors on users’ reporting tendency for public safety. Our lab experiment and online study show consistent results on how location context impacts people's reporting decisions. This finding informs the design of a novel location-based nudge mechanism, which is tested in another lab experiment with 84 participants and proved to be effective in changing users’ reporting decisions. Our follow-up interview study further suggests that the influence of people's mobility patterns (e.g., expected walking distance) could explain why the nudge design is effective. Our work not only informs the design of mobile crowdsourcing for public safety reporting but also demonstrates the value of applying a computational cognitive modeling approach to address HCI research questions more broadly.

AB  - A number of papers have surveyed mobile crowdsourcing systems and, to a lesser extent, situated crowdsourcing systems. These surveys have either contributed a comprehensive taxonomy of the diverse application domains where the systems have tapped into or have characterized different components of the system platforms. In this paper, we present a survey of mobile and situated crowdsourcing systems by addressing fundamental questions about user contributions that system designers pose when building new systems or evaluating existing ones. We select and analyze 40 mobile and situated crowdsourcing systems for which prototypes were deployed and studied in the real world. Inspired by the MIT's genetic model of collective intelligence, we propose our genetic model and new genes for mobile and situated crowdsourcing systems by examining user contributions to the selected systems. We present the observed patterns of different genes and discuss how the model can be used to create new applications and design ideas. By reviewing the existing design principles of online communities, we also provide examples to illustrate how unique genes inspire new design suggestions for encouraging user contributions in the context of mobile and situated crowdsourcing.

AB  - This study developed a Mobile Plant Learning System (MPLS) that provides instructors with the ways and means to facilitate student learning in an elementary-school-level botany course. The MPLS represented in this study was implemented to address problems that arise with the use of a didactic approach to teaching and learning botany, as is typically used in elementary schools in Taiwan. To extend opportunities for learning beyond the classroom, this study used personal digital assistants (PDAs) equipped with the MPLS, which provided both teachers and students access to plant information while in the field. A quasi-experimental research design was used to investigate the effectiveness of using the MPLS to support student learning. The responses to questionnaires and interviews indicate that students valued the outdoor learning activities made possible by use of the PDA and its functions. Pre- and post-test results demonstrated that students also benefitted academically from the use of the MPLS and the PDA. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In the conventional classroom, many obstacles hinder interaction between an instructor and students, such as limited class hours, fixed seating, and inadequate time for meetings after class. This work develops a novel multimedia mobile classroom feedback system (MMCFS) that instantly displays students’ responses, such as class-related questions or answers to questions on a quiz, on the instructor’s computer. This system reinforces interaction between instructors and students and improves learning efficiency. Its features are as follows: 1) automatic attendance checking; 2) in-class real-time evaluation; 3) improved willingness of students to raise questions; 4) immediate grade enquiring; 5) cross-platform functionality; 6) a virtual mobile classroom; 7) data integrity; 8) low construction cost; 9) group learning; and 10) learning process recording. This system uses a client-server and three-tiered architecture models as its framework. When a class is in progress, the instructor only requires a notebook computer with a web browser, while students need a mobile phone or equivalent mobile devices with built-in Java Platform, Micro Edition (J2ME) and wireless support. A web server and the rear-end database can be located outside the classroom when network connections are available. Attendance checking, conducting quizzes, instant question inquiring, and grade inquiring are the four primary functions of the system. A questionnaire is applied to evaluate system’s interactivity, mobility, and functionality. The 105 subjects comprised two classes of undergraduate students. The questionnaire addresses interactivity, mobility, and functionality. Its purpose was to compare the proposed system and the interactive response system (IRS). Experimental results show that the proposed system has superior interactivity, mobility, and functionality. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Purpose - Although the use of e-book readers has become increasingly widespread, there are few studies to evaluate e-book user behavior and satisfaction with commercial e-book stores, and even fewer approaches from the perspective of task-technology fit (TTF). In order to fill this gap, the purpose of this paper is to adopt the TTF theory to explore the factors that affect the behavior satisfaction of users of commercial e-book stores.
Design/methodology/approach - A survey was conducted to collect data from 183 e-book users. Data were collected from an online survey. The results were analyzed via the structural equation model.
Findings - The results show that functional service, mobility, convenience, and searching task are the important factors that influence users' TTF behavior. Moreover, TTF may improve user satisfaction, flow, and scanpath. Finally, satisfaction was affected by TTF, scanpath, and flow factors. An analysis of the research explained 46 percent of the variance for the users' TTF, and 59 percent of the variance for satisfaction of using the e-book store.
Originality/value - The research model modifies utility and performance from TTF theory in order to focus on individual flow, scanpath, and user satisfaction measurement because general e-book store users are not typically concerned about work performance issues for their leisure activities. These results provide a new perspective to e-book researchers and can help e-book store managers and designers in making policies and designing platforms.

AB  - We develop a new concept of rural technology diffusion influenced by labor mobility and business relations. The technology gain effect of labor mobility increases technology diffusion, whereas the technology drain effect decreases it. The concept is applied to survey data from the Mekong region, a new geographic area in this context. In the econometric analysis, which takes spatial correlation and geographic variables into account, technology is measured in the form of the number of mobile phones per village. The results support the technology gain and drain effects and show that labor mobility and business relations can help overcome geographic obstacles to rural development. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Existing formal models of political behavior have followed the lead of the natural sciences and generally focused on methods that use continuous-variable mathematics. In 2002, Stephen Wolfram produced an extended critique of that approach in the natural sciences, and suggested that a great deal of natural behavior can be accounted for using rules that produce discrete patterns. This paper reports some initial findings designed to apply this pattern-based method to political event data. We believe that discrete sequence rule (DSR) models can provide a new social science methodology that is capable of preserving the agential basis of social interaction, tracking multiple agents as they enact rules through behavior directed at one another, and capturing the evolution of such interaction over time. The core of this project is a new, publicly accessible Web-based tool designed for the visualization and analysis of event data patterns (http://www.nkss.org). Using event data on the Israel?Palestine conflict generated by the TABARI automated coding program of the Kansas Event Data System (KEDS) for the period 1979?2004, we perform an initial exploration of this methodology. Specifically, we identify patterned behavior for which specific rule use can be imputed, and then examine several agent-based rules, plus four ?meta-rules,? to parse Israeli?Palestinian interaction over time. Face validity of the analysis is apparent, and we also find the qualitative historical record can be augmented through observation of rule enactment in the event stream. Several descriptive empirical applications are demonstrated, including moving totals and increasingly complex sequences of rule enactment that go beyond the simple variations on tit-for-tat responses. While this paper represents an exploratory analysis of the method, the results are promising enough to warrant further investigation beyond its use in thick description as demonstrated here, to ultimately include hypothesis generation and falsification.

AB  - Gaining accurate information on illicit drug use and policing in real-world settings is a challenge. This study examines the utility of a smartphone app (?Going Out In Sydney?) to prospectively follow up illicit drug use and policing encounters at music festivals and licensed entertainment precincts in Sydney, Australia. In all, 38 regular festival and licensed entertainment venue attendees used the app to log nights out over a 3-month period, including (1) where they went (eg, festival, nightclub), (2) the prevalence of illicit drug use, and (3) the incidence and nature of police encounters. A survey and interview were then conducted about the utility of the app. The app enabled rich data collection (n?=?353 entries) about illicit drug use and policing at both target settings. Follow-up surveys indicated that most participants were extremely satisfied with the ease of use of the app and privacy afforded, and compared with other data collection modes, such as paper-based logs and online surveys, rated the app the most desirable method of data collection. This suggests smartphone apps may be a viable option for future studies on illicit drug use and policing of drugs.

AB  - Objective: To determine the extent to which a combination of existing machine-readable health terminologies cover the concepts and terms needed for a comprehensive controlled vocabulary for health information systems by carrying out a distributed national experiment using the Internet and the UMLS Knowledge Sources, lexical programs, and server. Methods: Using a specially designed Web-based interface to the UMLS Knowledge Source Server, participants searched the more than 30 vocabularies in the 1996 UMLS Metathesaurus and three planned additions to determine if concepts for which they desired controlled terminology were present or absent. For each term submitted, the interface presented a candidate exact match or a set of potential approximate matches from which the participant selected the most closely related concept. The interface captured a profile of the terms submitted by the participant and for each term searched, information about the concept (if any) selected by the participant. The term information was loaded into a database at NLM for review and analysis and was also available to be downloaded by the participant. A team of subject experts reviewed records to identify matches missed by participants and to correct any obvious errors in relationships. The editors of SNOMED International and the Read Codes were given a random sample of reviewed terms for which exact meaning matches were not found to identify exact matches that were missed or any valid combinations of concepts that were synonymous to input terms. The 1997 UMLS Metathesaurus was used in the semantic type and vocabulary source analysis because it included most of the three planned additions. Results: Sixty-three participants submitted a total of 41,127 terms, which represented 32,679 normalized strings. More than 80% of the terms submitted were wanted for parts of the patient record related to the patient's condition. Following review, 58% of all submitted terms had exact meaning matches in the controlled vocabularies in the test, 41% had related concepts, and 1% were not found. Of the 28% of the terms which were narrower in meaning than a concept in the controlled vocabularies, 86% shared lexical items with the broader concept, but had additional modification. The percentage of exact meaning matches varied by specialty from 45% to 71%. Twenty-nine different vocabularies contained meanings for some of the 23,837 terms (a maximum of 12,707 discrete concepts) with exact meaning matches. Based on preliminary data and analysis, individual vocabularies contained <1% to 63% of the terms and <1% to 54% of the concepts. Only SNOMED International and the Read Codes had more than 60% of the terms and more than 50% of the concepts. Conclusions: The combination of existing controlled vocabularies included in the test represents the meanings of the majority of the terminology needed to record patient conditions, providing substantially more exact matches than any individual vocabulary in the set. From a technical and organizational perspective, the test was successful and should serve as a useful model, both for distributed input to the enhancement of controlled vocabularies and for other kinds of collaborative informatics research.

AB  - Information technology and new media allow for collecting and sharing personal information at unprecedented levels. This study explores issues of privacy and surveillance with new interactive technologies. Based on a year-long field study, this project examines how people think about privacy and surveillance when using mobile social networks. Using the case of Dodgeball, the study found that most informants were not concerned about privacy when using the mobile social network because they felt they were in control of their personal information. There was, however, evidence of 3 kinds of surveillance present in everyday usage of Dodgeball: voluntary panopticon, lateral surveillance, and self-surveillance. This study sheds light on the everyday conceptions, meanings, and activities associated with surveillance, privacy, and interactive technologies. © 2011 International Communication Association.

AB  - Mobile geotagging services offer people new ways to interact with and through urban space. In this paper, we focus on a mobile geotagging service called Socialight and the social practices associated with it. In-depth interviews and participant observation were conducted in order to explore how Socialight's virtual "sticky notes" were used in everyday life. Findings indicated how users communicate about place to help build social familiarity with urban places and communicate through place to allow users to create place-based narratives and engage in identity management. Such findings deepen our understanding of the social production of space and have implications for future location-based mobile services. © 2011 International Communication Association.

AB  - Technological convergence has led to the ability to access the internet from a variety of mobile devices. Drawing on the Mobile Phone Appropriation Model (Wirth, von Pape & Karnowski, 2008), we sought to understand how people conceptualize and use the mobile internet by conducting semistructured interviews with 21 mobile internet users, half American and half German in order to explore cross-cultural differences. Findings suggest little cross-cultural difference in use and understanding of the mobile Internet. Users do not perceive the act of "going online" as a significant step, even if it is on a mobile device. They do, however, distinguish between different ways of consuming information online (extractive and immersive), relating them to different situations and devices. © 2013 International Communication Association.

AB  - Teachers in the US have been increasingly adopting mobile devices for teaching, but little research has examined how pre-service teachers perceive mobile device integration in classrooms. To address this issue, the study developed a research model that explained factors affecting pre-service teachers’ intention to use mobile devices and the relationship among the factors. A total of 386 pre-service teachers participated in an online survey, and the model was tested using structural equation modeling. The results showed that 72.5% of variances in pre-service teachers' intention to use mobile devices were explained by perceived usefulness and self-efficacy for technology integration jointly, where perceived usefulness was the strongest predictor. The findings also demonstrated that constructivist beliefs and perceived ease of use indirectly influenced pre-service teachers’ intention to use mobile devices for teaching.

AB  - Paper has been the format of choice for disseminating geographic information for millennia; however the arrival of the internet and mobile technologies has created new modes of map consumption. This paper investigates the future role of paper mapping in a society where access to online digital mapping is freely available. The research consists of an online survey to investigate how people use and view online/digital and paper maps, together with a task-based user study to investigate the suitability of each map format for a variety of given tasks. Similar to previous research, we categorize participants into two groups (experts and non-experts/novices) based on their level of geographic skill. Results demonstrate that geographic knowledge and the context of use clearly relate to preference of map format. As geographic skill increases, there is a greater preference for paper maps; non-experts prefer online/digital maps. Also, paper is the preferred medium for planning and executing navigation on foot across all groups. Overall, results suggest that paper maps are here to stay for the foreseeable future and remain the preferred choice for some in the digital age.

A deep and comprehensive understanding of the IFs and their impact on QoE for a given service is an essential precondition for successful QoE management with the overall goal of prominently optimizing end-user QoE, while making efficient use of network resources and maintaining a satisfied user base. The proposed conceptual model was used to conduct a qualitative meta-analytical review of selected papers. The results of the qualitative review include various IFs, QoE dimensions, and key findings in the form of research recommendations for QoE in the context of UC.

AB  - A hypermedia system was introduced into an undergraduate biology curriculum in order to investigate the patterns of students' interaction with, and attitudes to such a system, both to develop the interface of the system itself, and to provide objective means of describing its usage in a real learning situation. This was seen as a prerequisite to any evaluation of actual learning outcomes. The paper describes the development process which involved not only the evolution of the system itself, but the construction and implementation of assessment tools. The use of these tools enabled the authors to draw a number of conclusions about the patterns of interaction that students demonstrated when given various learning tasks to carry out. Interactions were seen to be driven primarily by the task, rather than by any individual preferences on the part of the users. It is suggested that this may have important implications for the knowledge that users gain from hypermedia systems. © 1993 Butterworth-Heinemann Ltd.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to better understand the online black market economy, specifically relating to stolen data, using crime script analysis. Content analysis of 13 English- and Russian-speaking stolen data forums found that the different products and services offered enabled the commodification of stolen data. The marketplace offers a range of complementary products, from the supply of hardware and software to steal data, the sale of the stolen data itself, to the provision of services to turn data into money, such as drops, cashiers and money laundering. The crime script analysis provides some insight into how the actors in these forums interact, and the actions they perform, from setting up software to finalizing transactions and exiting the marketplace.

AB  - This article analyses two 'digital Bibles', products that allow the user to engage with the Bible through the screen and speakers of his/her mobile phone, tablet or computer. Both products, 'YouVersion' and 'GloBible', have been created by Evangelical Christian companies. I argue that both are designed to train the user in traditional Evangelical Christian understandings of the work of reading. Digital media offer new opportunities to guide and influence the user, and this article applies the concepts of 'persuasive technologies' and 'procedural rhetoric' to analyse the design intentions of the two digital Bibles. This approach helps us to appreciate the significance of the material form of a sacred text as a vehicle for religious socialisation and raises important questions about the potential for digital media to re-shape traditional relationships of power in Evangelical Christian communities.

AB  - At first glance, mobile technology appears to have the potential to allow countries in Africa to technologically 'leapfrog' across the digital divide and provide much needed Internet access to a wide range of people currently unable to participate in the Information Society. This study investigates whether this potential is being actualized through the survey of a non-purposive sample population living in Johannesburg, South Africa. Studies have shown that aside from being able to engage with the new technology, people must also perceive it as reliable and user friendly. As such, this article examines user's attitudes and current behaviour with regards to this apparently highly accessible and relatively affordable medium. It also seeks to determine whether people believe that mobile technology could eclipse (or leapfrog) the use of computer technology for online activities - and if they believe that to be true, how have their usage patterns shifted, if at all?

AB  - Die Verfügbarkeit digitaler Medien ist in den letzten zehn Jahren sprunghaft angestiegen. Aufgrund eines Mangels an umfassenden Messinstrumenten geht dieses schnelle Wachstum des Zugangs zu digitalen Medien mit einem Mangel an Forschung einher, die den familiären Medienkontext und soziokognitive Ergebnisse untersucht. Es gibt auch wenig kulturübergreifende Forschung in Familien mit kleinen Kindern. Moderne Medien sind mobil, interaktiv und oft von kurzer Dauer, was es schwierig macht, sich an sie zu erinnern, wenn die Betreuungspersonen auf Umfragen zur Mediennutzung antworten. Das Comprehensive Assessment of Family Media Exposure (CAFE) Konsortium hat ein neuartiges Instrument entwickelt, um die Mediennutzung im Haushalt mittels eines webbasierten Fragebogens, eines Zeitnutzungstagebuchs und einer App zur passiven Erfassung, die auf den mobilen Geräten der Familie installiert ist, zu messen. Das Ziel der Entwicklung einer umfassenden Bewertung der Medienexposition von Familien war es, die Kontextfaktoren der Mediennutzung zu berücksichtigen und die Einschränkungen bestehender Selbstauskünfte zu verbessern, während gleichzeitig ein konsistentes, skalierbares und kosteneffektives Instrument geschaffen wurde. Das CAFE-Tool erfasst den Inhalt und den Kontext der frühen Medienexposition und adressiert die Grenzen bisheriger Medienmessansätze. Vorläufige Daten, die mit dieser Messung gesammelt wurden, wurden in eine gemeinsame Visualisierungsplattform integriert. In diesem perspektivischen Artikel verfolgen wir einen "tools-of-the-trade"-Ansatz (Oakes, 2010), um vier Herausforderungen zu beschreiben, die mit der Messung der Mediennutzung in Familien mit kleinen Kindern verbunden sind: die Messung von Einstellungen und Praktiken, die Erfassung von Inhalten und Kontext, die Messung kurzer Zeitspannen der Nutzung von Mobilgeräten und die Integration von Daten, um die Komplexität der Mediennutzung im Haushalt zu erfassen. Wir illustrieren, wie jede dieser Herausforderungen mit vorläufigen Daten, die mit dem CAFE-Tool gesammelt und auf unserem Dashboard visualisiert wurden, angegangen werden kann. Wir schließen mit einem Ausblick auf zukünftige Entwicklungen, einschließlich Plänen zur Prüfung der Zuverlässigkeit, Validität und Verallgemeinerbarkeit dieser Messungen. (translated by DeepL)

AB  - Telecommunication offers a cost-saving alternative to face-to-face vocational rehabilitation (VR) service delivery, yet little is known about the current use. This article describes findings from an exploratory survey of 1,187 counselors, representing 13 VR agencies across the United States. The online survey explored agency, counselor, and client facilitators and barriers to telecommunication use during the VR process. Staff with training in telecommunication strategies reported significantly higher rates of email telecommunication (p < .01). Counselors with a higher rural caseload mix engaged in significantly less email telecommunication during the VR process, and rural clients as compared with urban clients were characterized as having less personal access to a computer with Internet. Although counselors use and rely on simple telecommunication methods such as phone and email to serve their clients, strategies to address barriers are needed to expand telecommunication use during the VR process.

AB  - Cyber-bullying is one of the most remarkable problems of the digital age. In this paper we want to describe current trends of cyber-bullying among Japanese schoolchildren based on the survey our research team exercised on 2008 - 2009 in Gunma & Saitama prefecture. The outstanding property of Japanese cyber-bullying is that it is exercised not through PCs but through mobile phones. In Japan it is quite common among teenagers that they use the internet through their mobile phones, & at the same time, they are exposed to various kinds of net business ads & seduced to spend their time and money for SNSs or on-line games. Accessed not from PCs in their living room but from their mobile phones in their own rooms or on the streets, digital troubles including cyber-bullying, defaming or incitement to some other illegal activities are very difficult to find out for the teachers or the parents in Japan. We want to describe what Japanese teachers or parents suffer from & what Japanese schools or citizens do in order to protect the schoolchildren from these cyber troubles.

AB  - Mobile devices capable of accessing the Internet have become ubiquitous, creating both challenges for educators, as well as opportunities for students. Faculty members have various policies concerning mobile technology, ranging from laissez-faire policies in which students do as they wish, to complete bans on the use of mobile technology in the classroom. Still other instructors design learning environments integrating the usage of smart phones, tablets, or laptops. Yet, few studies have examined students' attitudes toward mobile technology usage and policies. This research describes university students' perceptions concerning mobile devices in the classroom. Based on a survey conducted at the California Polytechnic State University, the following topics are reported and discussed: 1) How do students use technology in class, including habits and web sites visited? 2) Do students experience self-reported distraction from mobile devices, laptops, and tablets? 3) What issues concerning technology and test security are students aware of? 4) What are students' perceptions of the benefits of technology? and, (5) What classroom policy suggestions do students offer? Recommendations concerning mobile technology policies in the classroom and issues for educator consideration are provided. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - This paper presents a method to improve the navigation and manipulation of radiological images through a sterile hand gesture recognition interface based on attentional contextual cues. Computer vision algorithms were developed to extract intention and attention cues from the surgeon's behavior and combine them with sensory data from a commodity depth camera. The developed interface was tested in a usability experiment to assess the effectiveness of the new interface. An image navigation and manipulation task was performed, and the gesture recognition accuracy, false positives and task completion times were computed to evaluate system performance. Experimental results show that gesture interaction and surgeon behavior analysis can be used to accurately navigate, manipulate and access MRI images, and therefore this modality could replace the use of keyboard and mice-based interfaces.

AB  - Wearable technology has many industrial applications. Optimal use adherence and outcomes largely depend on employee acceptance of the technology. This study determined factors that predict employee acceptance of wearables. An online survey of 1273 employed adults asked about demographics, job and organizational characteristics, experience with and beliefs about wearables, and willingness to use wearables. Use cases focused on workplace safety elicited the highest acceptance. An employees performance expectancy and their organizational safety climate were common predictors of acceptance across use cases. Positive past experiences coincided with involving employees in choosing the device and adequately informing them about data use. Organizations intending to implement wearable technology should (a) focus its use on improving workplace safety, (b) advance a positive safety climate, (c) ensure sufficient evidence to support employees' beliefs that the wearable will meet its objective, and (d) involve and inform employees in the process of selecting and implementing wearable technology.

AB  - This study examined interventions with parents/carers in child and adolescent counselling and psychotherapy (CAP). The aim was to investigate clinicians' rationale behind their decision to work with parents and what types of interventions they use. Furthermore, the nature of clinicians' core training with regard to interventions with parents was investigated. The study used both quantitative data and qualitative textual data from an online survey of 110 CAP clinicians. There was significant agreement, regardless of previous training or level of experience, that clinical work with parents in CAP is beneficial, but little consensus for a rationale or model for best practice. There was a relationship between training, theoretical orientation and whether CAPs felt competent to work with parents. Unexpectedly, a significant number (83%) of integrative practitioners said that there had been ‘little’ to ‘none at all’ focus on working with parents on their core training course. Other unforeseen findings were in the domain of working outside generally accepted boundaries for CAP, with a notable number of clinicians making home visits—24.1% with parents alone and 38.9% with parent and child together—along with 47.2% using phone calls and/or email for coaching and support with parents. Many clinicians were candid about their sense of a lack of competence in working with parents, even though at least half were senior, experienced clinicians. A number of these practitioners made specific reference to the wish for further specialist training, with many asking for signposting to where further training could be obtained.

AB  - This study aimed at developing and testing a model that can explain how overload perceived in relation to organizational use of mobile instant messaging services (MIMs) leads to burnout and turnover intention in employees through the mediating effect of roleoriented stressors such as role ambiguity and role conflict. To empirically test the model, an online survey was conducted with 434 office workers in South Korea who used KakaoTalk for organizational purposes. Overload in KakaoTalk use was measured in three dimensions: information, communication, and system feature overload. Path analysis results showed that information overload and system feature overload significantly increased role ambiguity and role conflict, which ultimately led to significant increases in burnout (in the form of emotional exhaustion and reduced personal achievement) and turnover intention.

AB  - Online and offline storage of digital currency present conflicting risks for a Bitcoin exchange. While bitcoins stored on online devices are continually vulnerable to malware and other network-based attacks, offline reserves are endangered on access, as transferring bitcoins requires the exposure of otherwise encrypted and secured private keys. In particular, fluctuations in customer demand for deposited bitcoin require exchanges to periodically refill online storage systems with bitcoins held offline. This raises the natural question of what upper limit on online reserves minimizes losses due to theft over time. In this article, we investigate this optimization problem, developing a model that predicts the optimal ceiling on online reserves, given average rates of deposits, withdrawals, and theft. We evaluate our theory with an event-driven simulation of the setup, and find that our equation yields a numerical value for the threshold that differs by less than 2% from experimental results. We conclude by considering open questions regarding more complex storage architectures.

AB  - Information systems researchers have suggested that the world would move to Uber Commerce (U-Commerce) with a high degree of personalization. However, research in measuring U-Commerce constructs (ubiquity, universality, uniqueness, and unison) is sparse, and out of the 4 U-constructs, only perceived ubiquity has a measurement scale. In the present study, we construct reliable and valid measures for the three other (excluding Perceived Ubiquity) U-constructs. To this end, the study uses a stepwise approach starting from theoretical and qualitative exploration (using focus groups) and follows up with survey research (sampling 250 students and 326, 311, and 511 nonstudents in four consecutive surveys, respectively). Using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, the study develops reliable and valid multidimensional scales for the three U-constructs. Subsequently, the three U-construct scales are integrated with perceived ubiquity to form a comprehensive higher order scale named U-Feat, and it is validated in a nomological network of antecedents and consequences. U-Feat was found to have a significant effect on U-Commerce adoption.

AB  - Delivering reliable and high-capacity Internet connectivity to high-speed train users is a challenge. Modern railway cars act as Faraday cages, and a typical train comprises several hundreds of users moving at high velocity. Furthermore, with the global availability of 4G LTE, user expectations have dramatically increased: it is expected to be online anytime and anywhere. Demand for high-capacity mobile is being driven by video and music streaming services, for lower latency and higher availability by gaming, and for more reliability and even uplink capacity by mission-critical applications. Finally, the life cycle of the railway industry is much longer than for telecommunications, which makes supporting 5G challenging. In this article, we survey the challenges associated with delivering high-capacity connectivity to train users, describe potential options, and highlight how a leading western European operator is tackling these challenges and preparing for 5G and beyond.

Four categories are created on the basis of two variables, namely, the penetration and rate of growth of mobile phones. The paper answers questions such as: Which countries do well and badly on both variables? Are the countries in these categories drawn from specific regions or similar income levels or is the distribution more random? How can similar countries from the same region appear in two diametrically opposite categories? What does this imply for policy? (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The question of what it means to use the concepts of modernity and the modern sounds like an arcane theoretical concern. Were not those issues sorted out at the end of the twentieth century in the Great Debate between the moderns and postmoderns? Did not the postmoderns win that struggle, only to disintegrate a decade later in their infinite recursions into relativism? Are not we now living in a time when we are all a bit modern and a bit postmodern, variously immersed in digital and personal networks of swirling meaning? However, for all of the marginal theoretical interest in the question of the modern today, the concept continues to carry extraordinary unacknowledged weight in mainstream descriptions and arguments. Long after the Great Debate, the modern continues to be counter-posed against other ways of life that are defined in the negative as pre-modern. In other words, those persons living as members of 'pre-modern' communities still do not have their dominant formations named except in the negative or in relation to the higher-order concept of 'the modern'. They are held in place by the prefix 'pre'. This is not to suggest that the writers of such narratives always intend that pre-moderns are lesser peoples. Certainly, contemporary discussions of the Islamic State have gone further than most to link the concept of 'the pre-modern' to the adjective 'evil', but the overwhelming tendency is to just take the term 'modernity' for granted as a description of our times - with the inevitable few wormholes of stagnation or regression eating into the map of modernity. Defining other ways of life in the negative can take the form of both arrogant assumptions of superiority and well-meaning descriptions of 'the Other'. There are even attempts to retrieve the integrity of their pre-modern way of life.Thus, by inference, at least in the gentler version of this narrative, pre-moderns become those who are on an anticipated civilizational climb. They are treated as those who are yet to achieve modern actualization beyond their 'past' identities, anticipating their 'future' potentialities. Thus the prefix 'pre' puts them on a timeline that tends to assume that being before means being less developed, while being later means being more developed. They continue to live in ways that are before modernity, just as 'we', usually designated as Europeans, were the first to take the necessary journey into the modern. When it comes to describing civilizational differences, this journey is said to require a renaissance or major reformation to become more than a technological gloss. They may have mobile phones and run airlines, and they may build tall towers in the desert, but because they did not go through a religious reformation, the continuing archaisms in their culture will always mean that they are prone to recursion, atavism, exotica and ... terrorism. It is amazing how many scholars and politicians in the West have missed the fact that Islam has gone through a series of reformations, not dissimilar to those of Christianity. Just as in the allegory of the Persian love cake, it is their rose petals and saffroncream icing that have seduced us, while it is their archaic or premodern power that we fear. Overall, we have not had time to know them more than at a distance.This tendency to treat the 'pre-moderns' as located at a distance in time is linked to the way in which the equally problematic concept of 'development' is used. The dominant distinction between 'developed' and 'developing' has for the last half century permeated the work of journalists, academics and practitioners. It carries the same sense of a Great Divide between them and us. For all of the attempts to find a different lexicon - Global North and Global South, Minority World and Majority World - the conditional terms 'developed' and 'developing' continue to form the dualism of choice. More than just being the comfortable fall-back position for most television commentators, trade negotiators and aid workers, it sets up a modernist assumption that, given time, there is no alternative. Development is the only achievable condition. In coming from before or in being left behind, the only other possibility apart from developing or being developed is being underdeveloped. In short, they now also include peoples who cannot develop due to actions perpetrated by us. This constituency is similarly defined in the negative - they are 'under' us. By a tightening circle of logic, they are understood as coming from the past and are given no alternative but to develop, stagnate, or succumb to a condition that is made by us. It is no wonder (think the mainstream developmentalists, at least) that they build spectacular and unsustainable towers in the desert. They are trying to transcend the stifling sands of the past.Why is there a common tendency to assume that peoples of the deserts of Arabia to the jungles of Africa and Oceania, from the Mashriq to the Maghreb, have never been modern? Rather than trying to answer this question directly, the present essay uses this question as a point of departure to go back to basics. The essay is not about the Middle East and North Africa, but that region figures largely in the thinking that sits behind the discussion. The essay begins by exploring the general problem of defining modernity and the modern. We then focus, secondly, on a particular approach to elucidate further problems with understanding such categories. I have chosen the approach taken by Bruno Latour's We Have Never Been Modern because many people have turned to this text as a way out of the modernist problem. Here the still-opaque question 'How can one be a Persian?' becomes important. Its relevance will be explained shortly, but to give a hint, the question was first written by an eighteenth-century French social philosopher and put into the mouth of a fictional Persian character. In the third major section, the essay turns to set up an alternative approach to understanding the modern. It emphasizes a reflexively derived, relationally understood and ontologically elaborated approach. Using the metaphor of constitutive levels, it continues to draw upon old concepts such as the customary, traditional, modern and postmodern, but it puts them in a very different context.

AB  - Current estimates of the digital divide in mobile phones between rich and poor countries are based on the ethnocentric assumption that in both regions the use of these products takes place through individual ownership. As defined by most international organizations, the digital divide in mobile phones is the ratio of subscribers in developed countries to subscribers in developing countries. This definition however assumes that the only way in which benefits accrue to individuals is by individual ownership of mobile phones. The author will argue that current measures of this divide are quite heavily overstated, in some cases to the point where the divide disappears altogether. For this purpose the author will rely mainly on household survey data that pertains to the middle of the past decade. The first part of the paper deals with the context of the digital divide and a description of the major socio-economic effects of mobile phones. The second part is concerned with the concepts and measures of sharing while the final part is concerned with empirical evidence.

AB  - From a low initial base it is not difficult for developing countries to close the relative digital divide with the developed countries. A more challenging and novel question is whether, because of leapfrogging and other latecomer advantages, developing countries have grown faster than developed from the same initial starting point. Or, is it the case rather that the disadvantages of being a latecomer exceed the advantages? Are there any pronounced outliers among the developing countries and what are their distinguishing characteristics? Using a number of methods and data sources I seek to answer these questions in a tentative but provocative manner. [Copyright 2008 Elsevier Inc.]

AB  - Text messaging has emerged as a potentially useful tool to help smokers quit. This paper evaluates smokers' preferences for the Quittext program, which examines the feasibility and acceptability of delivering tailored smoking cessation advice via mobile phone text messaging. Thirty smokers completed a web‐based smoking behavior questionnaire and received 6 weeks of tailored text messages. Feedback was obtained via questionnaires and semistructured interviews. Smokers reported a preference for positive support, tailoring message content, and the ability to interact with the system. Delivering quitting advice by text message was considered feasible and acceptable. This research contributes to the literature; however, further intervention evaluation is warranted, with larger controlled studies needed to fully assess program feasibility and its effect on quit rates.

AB  - Multilingual classrooms in developing countries are often challenged by a lack of digital resources and technology which supports their multilingual learning process. Code-switching is a phenomenon common to multilingual schools where learners are taught in a language which is not their first language. In these environments, code-switchers frequently alternate between their first and second languages, seeking alternative words to clarify their understanding of the topic being studied. This paper presents a study based in South Africa, where mathematics learners interacted with a mobile learning system named M-Thuto, supporting learners who code-switch while learning and providing them with digital resources. The system consisted of summarised notes, class exercises and a class quiz. Through semi-structured interviews and questionnaires, data were gathered and analysed from 90 learners to gain perspectives on their interaction processes. The study aimed to establish how mobile learning can be used to support multilingual learners in under-resourced schools. The results of the study reflect the need for mobile learning resources that support their learning considering their linguistic challenges. The results also reflect the important role that mobile phones can play as alternative digital learning resources. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

The findings show that particular installers that carry out repair jobs are highly m-communication relevant. They have low internet usage, their devices are newer than average and the usage of network-independent features are higher than average. Furthermore, company-paid phones seem to stimulate phone usage during work. However, there do not seem to be any work-relevant nonvoice services available. Nevertheless, the interest and demand for work-related services will increase as the general adoption increases. A large part of the target audience is already exhibiting high interest in manufacturer-produced, work-related mobile services.Journal of Brand Management (2008) 16, 51–62. doi:10.1057/bm.2008.19; published online 6 June 2008 [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Failure in organizations is very common. Little is known about whether leaders should provide information about past organizational failure to followers and how this might affect their future performance. We conducted a field experiment in which we recruited temporary workers to carry out a phone campaign to attract new volunteers and randomly assigned them to either receive or not to receive information about a failed mail campaign pursu-ing the same goal. We find that informed workers performed better, regardless of whether they had previously worked on the failed mail campaign or not. Evidence from a second field experiment with students asked to sup-port voluntarily a campaign for reducing food waste corroborates the finding. We explore the role of leadership tactics behind our findings in a third online survey experiment. We conclude that information about past failure is unlikely to have a negative impact on work performance, and might even lead to performance improvement. Implications for future research on the relevance of leadership tactics when giving such information are discussed.

AB  - Background. The mode of combining mobile terminals and mobile digital music has gradually entered a bottleneck period while promoting the development of the mobile terminal industry. Proposing personalized solutions for specific groups of people including subhealthy people has become the current direction for the further long-term development of this mode. Understanding the influencing factors that affect subhealthy people's selection of mobile digital music is an urgent problem that needs to be solved in the development of personalized solutions. Objective. This article analyzes the influencing factors of the purchase intent to buy mobile digital music for subhealthy people and provides suggestions for mobile terminal vendors on how to design personalized solutions for this group of people. Methods. In order to achieve the above goals, this article constructs an influencing factor model based on the theory of perceived value, collects data by means of questionnaires, and uses the method of structural equations to verify the proposed model. Results. The results show that perceived quality, perceived price, social value, and emotional value all have a significant effect on users' purchase intention. Meanwhile, the conditional value and epistemic value have a negative moderating effect on the relationship between the social value and subhealthy people's digital music purchase intention but strengthen the positive relationship between the emotional value and subhealthy people's digital music purchase intention. Conclusions. The analysis shows that mobile terminal vendors should have their own unique attitudes and feelings when designing personalized mobile digital music solutions for subhealthy people, clarify their position, find strategies to improve the experience of subhealthy people, and win the reputation of subhealthy people. Let subhealthy people have a sense of belongingness.

AB  - Smartphone addiction has been related to psychological, behavioral, and social problems, with attachment styles being found to be one of the more prevalent factors. This study explored the relationships between attachment styles and smartphone addiction, and then investigated the mediating roles of dysfunctional attitudes and self-esteem. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted with a voluntary college student sample in China (N = 297) to test the proposed hypotheses. It was found that anxious attachment styles positively predicted smartphone addiction. More importantly, dysfunctional attitudes and self-esteem were found to be mediators between anxious attachment styles and smartphone addiction, as well as close attachment styles and smartphone addiction. Deeper causes and implications are discussed.

AB  - Da die mobile Technologie es den Nutzern ermöglicht, überall und zu jeder Zeit online zu sein, berichten immer mehr Nutzer, dass sie sich ständig wachsam fühlen und mit den Online-Streams von Online-Informationen und -Kommunikation beschäftigt sind - ein Phänomen, das seit kurzem als Online-Vigilanz bezeichnet wird. Trotz der zunehmenden Verbreitung sind die Folgen dieser ständigen Ausrichtung auf Online-Informations- und Kommunikationsströme für das Wohlbefinden der Nutzer weitgehend unklar. In der vorliegenden Studie haben wir untersucht, ob ständige Wachsamkeit mit kognitiven Folgen in Form von erhöhtem Gedankenwandern und verminderter Achtsamkeit zusammenhängt und die daraus resultierenden Auswirkungen auf das Wohlbefinden untersucht. Um unsere Annahmen zu testen, haben wir ein Wegmodell auf Basis von Umfragedaten (N = 371) geschätzt. Das Modell unterstützte die Mehrheit unserer vorregistrierten Hypothesen: Online-Vigilanz war in der Tat mit Gedankenwandern und Achtsamkeit verbunden, aber nur Achtsamkeit vermittelte die Beziehung zu vermindertem Wohlbefinden. So waren diejenigen, die sich mental mit Online-Kommunikation beschäftigen, insgesamt weniger zufrieden mit ihrem Leben und berichteten von weniger affektivem Wohlbefinden, wenn sie auch eine reduzierte Achtsamkeit erlebten.

AB  - Although Sweden is one of the most digitalized countries and the Swedish population's use of the internet is among the most studied in the world, little is known about how Swedes with disabilities use internet. The purpose of this study is to describe use of and perceived difficulties in use of the internet among people with disabilities and to explore digital divides in-between and within disability groups, and in comparison with the general population. This is a cross-sectional survey targeting the same issues as other nationwide surveys but adapted for people with cognitive disabilities. Participants were recruited from May to October 2017 by adaptive snowball sampling. The survey comprised questions on access to and use of devices, and use of and perceived difficulties in use of internet. A total of 771 people responded to the survey, representing 35 diagnoses/impairments. Larger proportions of people with autism, ADHD and bipolar disorder reported using internet than other disability groups. Women with autism used the internet more than any other disability group, and women with aphasia used the internet the least. People with disabilities related to language and understanding reported more difficulties using internet than other disability groups. Larger proportions of participants than the general Swedish population reported not feeling digitally included. In many but not all disability groups, larger proportions of men than women reported not feeling digitally included. Our findings show that there are differences in digital inclusion between sub-groups of diagnoses/impairments. Thus, disability digital divides are preferably investigated by sub-grouping disabilities, rather than studied as one homogeneous group.

AB  - This paper examines the technologies that enable the representation of Hebrew on websites. Hebrew is written from right to left and in non-Latin characters, issues shared by a number of languages which seem to be converging on a shared solution-Unicode. Regarding the case of Hebrew, I show how competing solutions have given way to one dominant technology. I link processes in the Israeli context with broader questions about the 'multilingual Internet,' asking whether the commonly accepted solution for representing non-Latin texts on computer screens is an instance of cultural imperialism and convergence around a western artifact. It is argued that while minority languages are given an online voice by Unicode, the context is still one of western power. © 2013 International Communication Association.

AB  - While flow has been researched extensively in computer-mediated environments, it has been scarcely researched in the mobile interface context. Specifically, we have virtually no knowledge about what concrete traits of mobile interfaces (as opposed to user perceptions) encourage the flow state. Flow has been associated with many positive outcomes in human-computer interactions, making it vital for practitioners and scholars to understand the traits of mobile interfaces that encourage flow. Therefore, we synthesize the results of a literature search and a modified Delphi study to develop an inventory of traits and perceptions that can promote the flow experience. We provide initial evidence for the predictive validity of our inventory through a survey study which demonstrates that composite ratings of the inventory traits are positively associated with the flow state, which in turn, leads to compulsive usage and technostress. In doing so, this paper also extends flow research by exploring the potential negative outcomes of flow in the mobile interface context.

AB  - Media significantly shape how and what we learn. To date there is limited understanding of digital media and information use by engineering students. We comprehensively review existing literature and present findings from a research study investigating digital media and information use of ‘millennial’ engineers who purportedly possess distinctive experience, habits, and perceptions about technology. We administered a multiple-item survey to a cohort of first year engineering students who entered a large public university in the United States in August 2009. Self-reported information on the frequency of media device usage, participation in social networking, academic activities and information seeking tendencies, was received from 204 participants. Similar to other youth, millennial engineers use technology extensively and are frequent users of both commonly used digital devices as well as applications. Students’ device ownership was marked by a relatively low use of desktop computers and significant use of mobile devices. Students reported using the Internet extensively for both entertainment and school related work. Facebook™ use was common but Twitter™ use was limited. Multitasking was common and its self-reported effectiveness varied across participants. Gender differences were found across several items. Implications for teaching and learning are discussed.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In 2018, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required that electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) manufacturers, packagers, importers, distributors, and retailers display an addictive or alternate warning statement on e-cigarette visual advertisements. Few studies have investigated the FDA-mandated and other warnings on social media. This study examined the prevalence and content of warning statements in e-cigarette-related YouTube videos. METHODS: In 2019, The Virginia Commonwealth University Center for the Study of Tobacco Products conducted bi-monthly (February-June) YouTube searches by relevance and view count to identify e-cigarette-related videos. Overall, 178 videos met the inclusion criteria. Staff coded each video for the presence of a visual/verbal warning statement, warning statement type (eg, FDA-mandated, addiction/tobacco, safety/toxic exposure, health effects), sponsorship, and tobacco product characteristics. A data extraction tool collected the video URL, title, upload date, and number of views, likes/dislikes, and comments. RESULTS: Only 5.1% of videos contained FDA-mandated and 21.9% contained non-mandated warnings. All videos with FDA-mandated and 46.2% of non-mandated warnings were represented visually. Only 13.1% of industry-sponsored videos uploaded after the mandate effective date had an FDA-mandated warning statement and videos with FDA-mandated and non-mandated (v. no) warnings had significantly fewer views, likes, dislikes, and comments. Among all non-mandated warnings, 31.3% featured an addiction/tobacco, 18.8% a safety/toxic exposure, and 37.5% a health effects warning. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of FDA-mandated warning statements in e-cigarette related YouTube videos was low. FDA enforcement of the warning statement mandate on YouTube could increase the public's understanding of the addictive nature of nicotine in e-cigarettes. IMPLICATIONS: The FDA has the authority to regulate the advertisement and promotion of e-cigarettes on the Internet. These data can inform future FDA requirements related to the language content and visual representation of addiction/tobacco, safety/exposure, and health effects warning statements that appear in YouTube videos and other visual social media popular among young people. Such data would help consumers make informed decisions about purchasing e-cigarette products, using e-cigarettes, and avoiding unintentional harm related to e-cigarettes. In addition, these data may help social media platforms make decisions on whether they will prohibit advertisements that promote or facilitate the sale of tobacco products.

AB  - This eye-tracking study compared the usability of Yelp's Augmented Reality application Monocle with its familiar map-based app. Thirty participants (15 in each group) had to find a location in an outdoor mall using one version of the mobile Yelp app while wearing a pair of eye-tracking glasses that recorded the general area of the natural environment or smartphone their eyes focused on. Results showed that AR users could successfully arrive at the destination using the location-based technology that augments a visual display of the physical landscape with digital information. However, Augmented Reality users took longer to find the location than did map users. They also spent more time looking at the mobile smartphone and looked back and forth between the screen and the environment more often than map users. In open-ended questions about preference following the task, 14 of 15 in the AR group said they would likely use the Monocle app in the future to find a location because they could "see exactly" where something was or hated following directions. Since users successfully used this technology and reported enjoying its use, further development of AR for everyday use to complete tasks is encouraged. However, future studies should focus not only on the development of technology but its usability and employ visual communication theories such as Perception Theory (Barry, 2005) and Information Processing Theory (i.e., Krause, 1982) to help understand users' behavior.

AB  - The study aimed to examine the longitudinal causal relationships of depressive moods, problematic mobile phone use, and negative school outcomes based on the cognitive-behavioral model among Korean adolescents. The changes within each construct over time were also explored. A total of 1,610 valid responses from three-year longitudinal data from the Korean Children and Youth Panel Survey were analysed and multivariate latent growth modeling was used. Depressive moods, problematic mobile phone use, and negative school outcomes at earlier ages each increased in severity across the three years. Initial levels of depressive moods increased initial levels of problematic mobile phone use and negative school outcomes, including changed rates of negative school outcomes. Additionally, changed rates of depressive moods positively predicted changed rates of problematic mobile phone use and negative school outcomes. Lastly, initial levels and changed rates of problematic mobile phone use predicted initial levels and changed rates of negative school outcomes respectively. Implications of the findings in the context of adolescents' psychological problems and problematic mobile phone use are discussed.

AB  - Because campus officials are relying on personal communication technologies to communicate with students, a question arises about access and usage. Although communication technologies are popular among college students, some evidence suggests that differences exist in ownership and use. We examined patterns of student ownership and use of cell phones and use of instant messaging, focusing on three predictors of digital inequality: gender, ethnicity, and income. Logistic and hierarchical linear regression analyses were used to analyze results from 4,491 students. The odds that female and white students owned cell phones were more than twice as high as for men and African-American students. Students in the $100,000–$149,000 per year income bracket were more than three times as likely to own a cell phone than those from the median bracket. However, being female, African-American, and/ or from the highest income brackets was positively predictive of the number of text messages sent and the amount of time spent talking on a cell phone per week. We found no differences between students on the use of instant messaging. Implications of these results, as well as areas for further research, are provided.

AB  - The proliferation and ease of access to information and communication technologies (ICTs) such as Facebook, text messaging, and instant messaging has resulted in ICT users being presented with more real-time streaming data than ever before. Unfortunately, this has also resulted in individuals increasingly engaging in multitasking as an information management strategy. The purpose of this study was to examine how college students multitask with ID's and to determine the impacts of this multitasking on their college grade point average (GPA). Using web survey data from a Large sample of college students at one university (N = 1839), we found that students reported spending a large amount of time using ICTs on a daily basis. Students reported frequently searching for content not related to courses, using Facebook, emailing, talking on their cell phones, and texting while doing schoolwork. Hierarchical (blocked) linear regression analyses revealed that using Facebook and texting while doing schoolwork were negatively associated with overall college GPA. Engaging in Facebook use or texting while trying to complete schoolwork may tax students' capacity for cognitive processing and preclude deeper learning. Our research indicates that the type and purpose of ICT use matters in terms of the educational impacts of multitasking. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Applying self-determination theory, this study investigates how users' tracking behaviors relate to self-determination in the use of smart wearables, which enhances their intrinsic motivation (i.e., enjoyment) to use the device across age groups. An online survey with 494 smartwatch users aged 18 to 76 shows that the frequency of fitness data tracking is positively related to competence, autonomy, and relatedness needs fulfillment; only need for autonomy is positively associated with enjoyment. Age moderates the mediating effect of autonomy on the relationship between tracking fitness data and enjoyment. The findings are discussed from theoretical and practical perspectives.

AB  - The traditional innovation function, focusing on extrinsic motivations such as economic benefits and returns, has neglected the side of intrinsic values and public motivations for innovation function. Recent innovation examples in an era of mobile network and web-based information environment pursue open connected innovations such as open source movement and crowding source. Such open, collective and social innovations result from strong public motivation and trust network. Although previous studies argue the potential effects of intrinsic values on innovative attitude, research has not yet provided a comprehensive empirical evidence on how innovative attitude is associated with intrinsic and public motivations. Little empirical research remains for the impact of public motivations and intrinsic values on innovative attitudes. This study, relying on nationally represented survey (n = 3,188) in South Korea, explores an empirical link between public motivations and innovative attitudes to explore and allow new ideas. We found that public interest, empathy, altruism and job involvement facilitate innovative attitude to pursue and accept new ideas and suggestions. This implies that both intrinsic values (job enjoyment and satisfaction) and public motivations (public interests, empathy and altruism) are crucial factors to promote innovative attitudes. We also found strong non-linear relationships between satisfaction, trust and innovative attitude. We discuss implications for future innovation function of intrinsic and public motivations in terms of the process of social construction.

AB  - This research empirically tested cultural differences in the relationship between the components of unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) and trust. Using an online survey to collect data from mobile phone service users in Korea and the USA, we found two meaningful outcomes that may improve the understanding of technology acceptance behaviour. First, trust in smartphones significantly increased usage intentions, whereas trust formation was affected by users' expectancy of both performance and effort. Second, the relationship between the proposed UTAUT model constructs differed between the two countries. These findings indicate that trust in technological artefacts plays an important role in explaining technology adoption, and that culture may moderate the extent to which the antecedents of the technology acceptance model affect trust and usage intentions. Implications for practitioners are discussed, and suggestions for future research are provided.

A survey of smartphone users revealed that gender, age, personal innovativeness, and consumption skills were significant predictors of the frequent use for applications. Simply having more smartphone applications does not contribute to increases social or human capital; it is usage of these apps that makes a difference.

AB  - The mobile communications industry is an important sector with European total revenues growing approximately 10 per cent per year and reaching 174 billion in 2007 (GSMA, 2008). Markets all over Europe are mature, and the operators engage in intense competition for customers. Heavy investments are made in marketing in order to gain new customers, whereas few efforts are made to retain the customers and build profitable long-term relationships (Ferguson and Brohaugh, 2008). The aim of this article is to outline the Portuguese mobile communications market from the relationship-marketing point of view, and to review the antecedents of customer-brand relationships. A web-based survey on a sample of 606 older Generation Y mobile communication users was conducted. Optimus, TMN and Vodafone are all implementing marketing strategies based on emotions. They are building customer databases to manage relationships with their corporate brand/company, but our results reveal that not all of them reach the same level of attitude towards their brand, reputation, tribalism or satisfaction with the brand. TMN, despite being the market leader, demonstrates a poor level of results in terms of customer-brand relationship building. On the basis of the findings of this research, implications for marketing practice and directions for further research are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - As digitalization increases, retail firms must invest in online and mobile commerce to attract customers to their website or mobile store. Since the type of device used to access marketing channels influences conversions, this research examines the different impacts of different devices such as desktop computers, tablets, and smartphones on the success of various marketing channels. We find customer experience (CX) to be important in improving attribution outcomes (e.g., conversion rates) by combining clickstream and survey data to understand consumers' decision processes. Therefore, this paper also conceptualizes and measures perceptions of CX of clickstream-data participants. We identify the central implications of using each device.

AB  - This paper aims to contribute to the growing literature on the potential benefits of the Internet on rural livelihoods. We estimate the relationship between Internet access and agricultural production in rural Viet Nam using a panel dataset from 2008-2012. This is a time span during which Internet access increased substantially and government-run and private online outlets providing information about agriculture started to operate. Our findings suggest that Internet access is associated with a 6.8% higher volume of total agricultural output. We find that this result is manifested through more efficient use of fertilizer. Our findings are stronger for younger households. The less developed northern provinces have benefited the most from the arrival of the Internet. The results are weaker in the case of rice, which is related to strong government involvement in rice production and prices.

AB  - Due to the high burden of depression, new models and methods of mental healthcare need to be developed. Prior research has shown the potential benefits of using technology tools such as mobile apps as self-help or combined with psychological treatment. Therefore, professionals should acquaint themselves with evidence-based apps to be able to use them with clients and guide the clients in their use. The purpose of this study was to explore how an acceptance and commitment therapy-based mobile app was perceived as a self-management tool among nurses, and how it could be applied in the prevention and treatment of depression and other mental health issues. Sixteen Finnish nurses undergoing depression nurse specialist education used the app for 5 weeks and participated in semistructured focus group interviews. Interviews were analyzed by qualitative content analysis. In general, the nurses found the app suitable as a self-management tool and identified three models of using it in clinical practice. Having used the app personally, the nurses were eager to take it into use with various client groups, especially in occupational health but also in the treatment of mental health problems. However, they also raised concerns about the effort needed in familiarizing oneself with the content and pointed out specific client groups for whom the benefits of the app should be carefully weighed against the potential risks. Despite the small sample size, the findings suggest that involving technology tools as part of the nurses’ education could ease their adoption in clinical practice. The degree of professional support in the app use should be aligned to the severity of the mental health problems.

AB  - The authors provide a survey of how images are used in radiation therapy to improve the precision of radiation therapy plans, and delivery of radiation treatment. In contrast to diagnostic radiology, where the focus is on interpretation of the images to decide if disease is present, radiation therapy quantifies the extent of the region to be treated, and relates it to the proposed treatment using a quantitative modeling system called a radiation treatment planning (RTP) system. This necessitates several requirements of image display and manipulation in radiation therapy that are not usually important in diagnosis. The images must have uniform spatial fidelity: i.e., the pixel size must be known and consistent throughout individual images, and between spatially related sets. The exact spatial relation of images in a set must be known. Radiation oncologists draw on images to define target volumes; dosimetrists use RTP systems to superimpose quantitative models of radiation beams and radiation dose distributions on the images and on the sets of organ and target contours derived from them. While this mainly uses transverse cross-sectional images, projected images are also important, both those produced by the radiation treatment simulator and the treatment machines, and so-called "digital reconstructed radiographs," computed from spatially related sets of cross-sectional images. These requirements are not typically met by software produced for radiologists but are addressed by RTP systems. This review briefly summarizes ongoing work on software development in this area at the University of Washington Department of Radiation Oncology.

AB  - Background: The 5As for smoking cessation is an evidence-based intervention to aid providers in counseling patients to quit smoking. While most providers 'ask' patients about their tobacco use patterns and 'advise' them to quit, fewer patients report being 'assessed' for their interest in quitting, and even fewer report subsequent 'assistance' in a quit attempt and having follow-up 'arranged'. Purpose: This article describes the design of an implementation study testing a computer tablet intervention to improve provider adherence to the 5As for smoking cessation. Findings will contribute to the existing literature on technology acceptance for addressing addictive behaviors, and how digital tools may facilitate the broader implementation of evidence-based behavioral counseling practices without adversely affecting clinical flow or patient care. Methods: This project develops and tests a computer-facilitated 5As (CF-5As) model that administers the 5As intervention to patients with a computer tablet, then prompts providers to reinforce next steps. During the development phase, 5As' content will be programmed onto computer tablets, alpha and beta-testing of the service delivery model will be done, and pre-intervention interview and questionnaire data will be collected from patients, providers, and clinic staff about 5As fidelity and technology adoption. During the program evaluation phase, a randomized controlled trial comparing a group who receives the CF-5As intervention to one that does not will be conducted to assess 5As fidelity. Using the technology acceptance model, a mixed methods study of contextual and human factors influencing both 5As and technology adoption will also be conducted. Conclusions: Technology is increasingly being used in clinical settings. A technological tool that connects patients, providers, and clinic staff to facilitate the promotion of behavioral interventions such as smoking cessation may provide an innovative platform through which to efficiently and effectively implement evidence-based practices.

AB  - Although the literature has paid a lot of attention to the importance of mobile digital media in shaping people's perception of personal and social time, little empirical research has focused on these issues. We aim at bridging this gap by testing empirically a hypothesis that shared perceptions of social life in the smartphone era vary generationally. The analysis, based on representative survey data collected in Estonia in 2014 (n = 573), revealed three underlying dimensions of the perceptions of smartphone use: (1) Expanding flexibility and diverse opportunities, (2) Vanishing boundaries and foci, and (3) Changing social identity and communication conventions. Generational differences manifested in the case of the first and the second dimension, lending support to the initial hypothesis. In the case of the third dimension, other structural factors, time use and subjective perceptions of personal time, rather than generational differences, explained the variation in the perceptions of smartphone use.

AB  - The popularity of multiplayer online battle arena games is closely linked to customer engagement. The purpose is to investigate the influences that individual motivators and environmental antecedents have upon customer engagement and continuous playing games intention, and compare the impacts between playing Multiplayer online battle arena games on personal computers and on mobile phones. A Triadic reciprocal determinism framework was developed to explain the relationship among individual motivator (flow experience), environmental antecedents (technical features and social interaction), individual behavior (continuous playing games intention), and customer engagement within multiplayer online battle arena gaming settings. Altogether 531 questionnaires from multiplayer online battle arena players were collected. Structural equation modeling with Smart-partial least squares was used to evaluate the research model. The findings suggest that the influence of flow experience on customer engagement in personal computers gaming is more significant than that in mobile gaming, while the effects of perceived ease of use and offline social interaction on customer engagement in mobile gaming are comparatively higher. This study indicates the importance of flow experience, perceived control, perceived ease of use, and social interaction in the Multiplayer online battle arena gaming development and the prosperity for better customers engaged, and to enhance customer experience.

AB  - The current study examined how task performance enhancement, easiness, important others' opinions, entertainment motivation, information seeking motivation, and social connection motivation would predict use intention of mobile applications. Based on a motivational communication theory and the technology acceptance model, a web-based survey was administered among mobile application users. The results of hypothesised model testing show that easiness is the key factor influencing continuance intention of mobile application use. In addition, this study reveals that mobile application users consider human connection and social utility to be more important than entertainment in creating task performance, easiness, social influence, and use intention. This study combined motivations with technology adoption factors for mobile application use in an integrated model. This theoretical attempt strengthened the explanatory power of the technology adoption model for mobile application use. Mobile application vendors and developers must consider the user friendliness of their applications and how many purposes they satisfy. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Advances in information and communication technology (ICT) have provided a platform for the introduction and diffusion of a range of financial technologies that have transformed the financial sector. This study analyses the diffusion of financial technology (fintech) and its interaction with financial inclusion and living standards (GDP per capita). We consider the determinants and effects of technology diffusion in financial services and identify two possible transmission mechanisms from the financial sector to GDP per capita - a fintech diffusion channel and a financial inclusion channel. We specify the interactions between these two channels and their relationship with income per capita. Our empirical analysis focuses on the diffusion of two enabling fintech innovations: ATMs and associated digital networks; and mobile phones and payments systems. The relationships between fintech diffusion, financial inclusion and GDP per capita are estimated using a panel data set for up to 137 countries over the period 1991-2015 using both cross section and panel techniques, including an error correction model that distinguishes short- and long-run effects. A key finding is that fintech diffusion and financial inclusion have long-run effects on GDP per capita over and above their short-run impact and the effects of investment in fixed and human capital.

AB  - This paper’s premise is that technology has the potential to support the elicitation, expression and communication of positive thoughts. However, its success depends on understanding and incorporating appropriate strategies for interactive system design and development. Following in the positive psychology tradition, this paper presents two co-design studies investigating how positive thoughts can be mediated and shared. These studies involved approximately 50 participants, using paper-based questioning techniques and social–online tools that captured 151 contributions on what thoughts people like to share. The collected data demonstrated the potential for designing systems based on a prefixbased elicitation of positive emotions. Analysis of participants’ contributions suggests that various messages of a predominantly positive nature can be harnessed, emphasizing the importance of immediacy and situatedness in expression. Moreover, the analysis resulted in a set of design considerations for the design and development of positive expressive technologies. These considerations were used to develop a mobile application called PosiPost Me (Mobile Internet Edition) that allows users to create and share positive thoughts at any time and place. In this way, this research sets an exemplar of a design process for positive communicative systems while building on research in positive psychology, human–computer interaction and cognitive ergonomics. Relevance to industry: The studies conducted showed the feasibility of proposed approach and opens new avenues for technologies aimed at positive communication and wellbeing in the mobile environment. It also offers a set of design considerations to support designers in creating such positive expressive technologies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Investigated the effects of learning questions on self-regulated learning in Web-based learning environments (Web-LEs) in a series of three studies. In Study 1, 81 students received interactive learning questions different points of the study phase or did not receive any learning questions. Results showed a significant learning effect for all learning-questions groups compared to the control group. The second study presents findings from two experiments which dealt with the different ways of implementing sets of learning questions in Web-LEs. The first experiment investigated the effect of different learning questions distributions on learning activities and achievement. Participants (n = 61) worked on learning questions distributed within the learning environment in a fine-grained way, in a medium-grained way, or presented blocked. Blocked presentation of learning questions resulted in less achievement compared to medium-grained and fine-grained distribution of the same learning questions. Learning process data indicated that participants of the medium-grained group reported more monitoring of their learning process. The second experiment (n = 61) investigated effects of different learning questions on regulation. Two kinds of learning questions with differences in the feedback component and the number of distractors were compared to a no-learning questions group. A detailed analysis of the learning process revealed that elaborative feedback leads to better achievement if students use their opportunity to restudy content. Additionally, the number of learning questions solved in the guidance-learning question group correlated with achievement. The third study addressed how learning questions provided at the beginning of a study phase influence SRL and under what conditions they improve achievement. 122 participants worked either on inference learning questions, factual learning questions, irrelevant learning questions or no learning questions at all before studying in a Web-LE. Results showed that irrelevant learning questions led to less time spent on the relevant material compared to the other three groups. A deeper analysis of the process data revealed that search strategy and reported effort and concentration in studying the relevant material were crucial for the successful use of learning questions. On the basis of these three experimental studies practical implications were deduced, and the tool "Auditorium Mobile Classroom Service" (AMCS) was developed. AMCS delivers learning questions to students in university lectures via their mobile devices. AMCS considers the findings from the three experimental studies and allows delivering additional prompts that aim at supporting the effects of learning questions. Findings from two field studies demonstrate how learning questions can be implemented in SRL settings and reveal first positive evaluation of acceptance and technical functionalities of the tool.

AB  - Technology acceptance theories predict user intentions to use services tailored for organisational needs. However, in this paper, we postulate that the aforementioned theories do not apply when investigating intentions towards the use of mobile data services (MDS), as the latter encompasses supplementary characteristics, such as fun and enjoyment, which are not taken into account under available models of user acceptance. The incorporation of the affective dimension is proposed by reintroducing the Triandis theory of human behaviour to the MDS domain. A web-based survey (N = 219) was conducted to investigate our research hypotheses and validate our model of MDS usage intention. Results showed that the MDS usage intention can be predicted by cognitive and affective factors under the lens of social influences. Additionally, the main antecedents of MDS actual use are perceived usefulness, perceived value and intention to use MDS. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study tests two models of perceptual disconfirmation. Perceptual disconfirmation occurs when individuals have a negative expectation regarding their future conversation partners’ demeanor, but after conversing with and influencing their partners’ behavior, individuals’ assessment of their partners’ demeanor becomes more positive. This effect is, so far, novel to computer-mediated communication: When individuals with similar expectancies get acquainted using phone or face-to-face channels their negative preinteraction expectancies persist and assessments remain unchanged. This experiment explored the extent to which questions and disclosures, and partners’ disclosive responses, mediated perceptual disconfirmation. Individuals were led to believe that a dyadic conversation partner was either in a bad mood (negative and malleable expectation) or had a bad personality (negative and nonmalleable expectation). After a 30-min online conversation to get acquainted, perceptual disconfirmation emerged, although the verbal strategies did not mediate the effect. This study raises new questions about the process by which individuals who have negative expectancies of their future conversation partners defy these negative expectations and shift their attitudes to become more positive online.

AB  - Self‐involving responses are direct expressions of genetic counselors’ here‐and‐now feelings about/reactions to patients. Strategic, sparing use of self‐involving responses may enhance practitioner genuineness, likeability, and trustworthiness, decrease patient anxiety, and increase patient trust and engagement. Conversely, they may threaten patients who are uncomfortable with emotional expression or confuse them about the counselor's intentions. Despite theorized benefits and risks, no study has explored genetic counselor self‐involving responses. This study explored whether clinical genetic counselors use self‐involving responses with their patients, reasons for doing so, and their perceptions of when and why the responses work well versus poorly. Two‐hundred sixty‐eight genetic counselors, invited via a National Society of Genetic Counselors e‐blast, completed an online screening survey. Eighty‐nine percent reported using self‐involving responses with patients, and 17 were purposively selected to participate in semi‐structured phone interviews. Thematic analysis yielded themes regarding potential benefits, risks, counselor factors and context, and patient factors related to using self‐involving responses. Benefits include conveying counselor conditions for facilitating counseling process (e.g., genuineness, building rapport, focusing the session, and encouraging the patient to open‐up), and counseling outcomes by validating decision‐making. Risks of use include hindering counseling processes and outcomes by misperceiving patient feelings, boundary crossing, and being unduly directive. Factors, both from the counselor and the context of the session, include comfort with the technique, mastery of clinical skills, minimal knowledge of patient emotions, type of counseling session, and counselor practice specialty. Patient factors include prior rapport with the counselor, and patient emotionality and cultural background. Findings underscore the need for training about this technique. Future research could examine patients’ perceptions of self‐involving statements and differences in self‐involvement across practice specialties and counseling modalities.

AB  - Objective The objective of openFDA is to facilitate access and use of big important Food and Drug Administration public datasets by developers, researchers, and the public through harmonization of data across disparate FDA datasets provided via application programming interfaces (APIs). Materials and Methods Using cutting-edge technologies deployed on FDA's new public cloud computing infrastructure, openFDA provides open data for easier, faster (over 300 requests per second per process), and better access to FDA datasets; open source code and documentation shared on GitHub for open community contributions of examples, apps and ideas; and infrastructure that can be adopted for other public health big data challenges. Results Since its launch on June 2, 2014, openFDA has developed four APIs for drug and device adverse events, recall information for all FDA-regulated products, and drug labeling. There have been more than 20 million API calls (more than half from outside the United States), 6000 registered users, 20,000 connected Internet Protocol addresses, and dozens of new software (mobile or web) apps developed. A case study demonstrates a use of openFDA data to understand an apparent association of a drug with an adverse event. Conclusion With easier and faster access to these datasets, consumers worldwide can learn more about FDA-regulated products.

AB  - The aim of the study is to document how academics who mother have reorganized work and childcare since the beginning of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in the United States, how those shifts have affected their academic productivity, and solutions proposed by academics living these experiences. We collected data via an online survey and, subsequently, by conducting qualitative interviews with a subsample of participants. From June to August 2020, 131 female-identified academics who mother were recruited via a Facebook group, Academic Mamas, and participated in our online survey. Twenty participants were then interviewed via phone or Zoom to explore more deeply the experiences of academics who mother. Results of our research suggest that since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the pressure on academics who mother is immense. Analysis of the qualitative data revealed three major themes: (1) inability to meet institutional expectations; (2) juggling work and family life; and (3) proposed solutions. Our results suggest that significant efforts must be made by academic institutions to acknowledge and value the childcare responsibilities of academics who mother and to create solutions that fully address the challenges they face in meeting the academic expectations and requirements that largely remain unmodified despite the pandemic.

AB  - The economic rationale for how much market power is tolerable has so far been based mainly on static considerations; ideally, however, it should discriminate between persistent and transitory market power. I propose a dynamic dominant-firm type of model where the firm's use of market power, when it is discovered by an antitrust agency, will be penalized. Equilibrium entails a threshold market share above which the market tends toward monopoly and below which the market tends to competition. One may propose the region below this threshold to be the safety zone. The size of this region depends on how fast market power depreciates. In industries in which this depreciation is fast and where, as a result, monopoly power is more transitory, the safety zone should be wider, and there should be less policy intervention. © The Author (2009).

AB  - This research was previously published in the Handbook of Research on Media Literacy in the Digital Age edited by Melda N. Yildiz and Jared Keengwe, pages 436-455, copyright year 2016 by Information Science Reference (an imprint of IGI Global). A questionnaire survey was conducted with university students from a women’s university in Japan on the use of mobile phones during a lecture. Topics specifically investigated included (1) whether students put their mobile phone on their desk during the lecture, (2) the reasons why students put their phone on their desk during the lecture, (3) responses to incoming calls during the lecture, and (4) the psychological impact on students of setting rules regarding the use of mobile phones during the lecture. Students were divided into two groups according to their responses to item (1): those who said they put their phone on their desk and those who said they did not do so. These groups were compared in terms of items (3) and (4). As a result, it was found that over 60% of students put their mobile phone on their desk during the lecture and that these students were more likely to use their mobile phone during the lecture. The survey suggested that students today are aware of mobile phone etiquette with respect to lectures, and are especially aware that communication etiquette conflicts with lecture etiquette.

AB  - Speed of exchange is important in communication using mobile phones. This study analyzes responses to a questionnaire survey of Japanese university students about replies to mobile text messages. Respondents were asked to indicate situations where a quick reply was desired and situations where a slow reply was acceptable. Free responses were classified broadly into seven groups such as "attributes of the other party," "one's own emotional state," "one's own situation," and "situation of the other party." Additionally, gender differences were seen in these free responses, with men more often referring to the attributes of the other party and their own situation and women more often referring to the content of the text messages. The results of the questions asking respondents to rank emotions by desired speed of response showed that there are individual differences in the relation between the type of emotion conveyed and the desired speed of reply (e.g., a quick reply was desired when joy or apology was conveyed). These individual differences were then aggregated into three types by cluster analysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aims: The COVID-19 pandemic forced closure of most U.S. university campuses in March 2020, obliging millions of students to finish their semesters via remote learning. This study examines whether and how students’ prior and current experiences of digital inequality—defined as constrained access to the internet and internet-connecting devices—were associated with their remote learning experiences. Method: An anonymous, online survey of 2,913 undergraduate college students from 30 U.S. universities completing their spring term remotely was conducted between April and May 2020. Hypothesis testing utilized a structural equation model with cluster-bootstrapped standard errors and p-values, to account for students being clustered by university. Results: Findings revealed that students’ challenges with internet connectivity and digital devices during remote learning were associated with lower remote learning proficiency (RLP). Difficulty communicating with professors and teaching assistants was also associated with lower RLP. Prior experience with online coursework was associated with higher RLP, and digital inequality challenges during the year prior to the pandemic with lower RLP. Moreover, students who reported greater financial hardship since the start of the pandemic experienced significantly more connectivity, device, and faculty communication challenges during remote learning, and had significantly lower RLP. Conclusions: Many students will continue to learn remotely in some form until the pandemic recedes. We identify key factors associated with students’ remote learning proficiency: (1) consistent, high-speed internet connectivity and functioning devices to connect to it, and (2) the ability to relate to and communicate easily with professors and teaching assistants. This study identifies potential barriers to effective remote learning, as well as possible opportunities to improve students’ experiences. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study employed a mixed methods approach (a survey [n = 2,774] and focus groups [n = 16]) to understand the perceptions of younger drivers (18-25) on current smartphone laws in the Australian state of Victoria. First, by analysing quantitative data gathered from an online survey regarding smartphone laws, perceptions of punishment when breaking the law, and attitudes to both the law and fines, this study found younger drivers were less likely to understand the law around phone use while driving, even after direct or indirect experience with police. Additionally, the severity and impact of fines were perceived as more impactful and severe among younger drivers, women, and those on lower incomes, and the most common types of illegal use younger drivers engaged with were navigation, music applications, and hands-free calling, mostly facilitated through Bluetooth with their device placed out of sight. Consequently, focus groups were conducted with a subset of these younger drivers to explore these findings in more depth. It was revealed that smartphone laws were perceived to be ambiguous, at times unreasonable, and difficult to access conclusive information regarding the law or receive information throughout the Graduated Licencing Program. Additionally, of full licenced drivers breaking smartphone laws (n = 807), 61.7 percent never used a cradle. Among probationary drivers breaking the law (n = 209), 76.1 percent never used a cradle. This suggests rampant surreptitious illegal use. As such, younger drivers learning to drive are also learning methods to avoid punishment while breaking smartphone laws. This included not using a cradle and opting instead for Bluetooth connectivity or engaging in hand-held use, a choice that continued into Full Licensed driving. The severity of punishment was not common knowledge and was perceived to be incommensurate to the risks associated with certain types of use. In their opinion all of these factors reduced the legitimacy of the law. Addressing these factors with evidence-based countermeasures may increase compliance and road safety.

AB  - The ubiquity of mobile devices and the apps that power them has spurred concerns that they are contributing to the decline in news media use. Mobile devices, however, have been credited with spurring political participation. In its examination of app-reliant individuals, this study found that reliance on apps positively predicts political participation, and respondents who rely heavily on mobile apps for political information are more politically active than light app users on six of the seven measures of nononline participation and three of the six measures of online political activity. Heavy-reliant users also rely more heavily on all six online-only media tested than light app users and rely more heavily on broadcast television news, CNN, and news magazines. Data were collected from October 31, 2016, through November 2, 2016, from 644 respondents of a national online panel.

AB  - This report describes the early design stages of ReacTickles Global, a new phase of the Reactive Colours project that is being developed collaboratively with designers from the Welsh Institute of Research in Art and Design (WIRAD), end users and an advisory panel from a range of related disciplines. The broad aim of ReacTickles Global is to explore how the inherent connectivity of mobile and web technologies can be exploited to encourage playfulness, creativity and social communication. The proposed target population is people with learning disabilities who might be disadvantaged at having to use traditional text-based formats in order to master mobile communication and to enjoy social networks. The project will draw upon the experiences and outcomes of Reactive Colours, which developed on the basis of a flexible and agile design methodology that included the ideas and experiences of the target population throughout the design process. At an appropriate stage evaluation will consider whether playful social interaction with ReacTickles Global has the potential to enable learning that is both socially constructed and collaborative.

AB  - The emergence of synthetic biology holds the potential of a major breakthrough in the life sciences by transforming biology into a predictive science. The dual-use characteristics of similar breakthroughs during the twentieth century have led to the application of benignly intended research in e.g. virology, bacteriology and aerobiology in offensive biological weapons programmes. Against this background the article raises the question whether the precautionary governance of synthetic biology can aid in preventing this techno-science witnessing the same fate? In order to address this question, this paper proceeds in four steps: it firstly introduces the emerging techno-science of synthetic biology and presents some of its potential beneficial applications. It secondly analyses contributions to the bioethical discourse on synthetic biology as well as precautionary reasoning and its application to life science research in general and synthetic biology more specifically. The paper then identifies manifestations of a moderate precautionary principle in the emerging synthetic biology dual-use governance discourse. Using a dual-use governance matrix as heuristic device to analyse some of the proposed measures, it concludes that the identified measures can best be described as "patchwork precaution" and that a more systematic approach to construct a web of dual-use precaution for synthetic biology is needed in order to guard more effectively against the field's future misuse for harmful applications.

AB  - Video captured by increasingly ubiquitous civilian cameras and communicated to a mass audience over the Internet is capable of bypassing police jurisdictional influence over traditional mass media and may be affecting police-civilian interactions in American public space as the initial cusp of a paradigm shift. Historically, the ability to visually record activities in public space was reserved to those with the resources and the motivation to devote to the task. Police and traditional mass media wielded power through cameras, power often not available to the public. Today, police often find their cameras outnumbered by those under autonomous citizen control. An inexpensive cell phone can instantly publish user-generated video to Internet servers available to a world audience and beyond local police jurisdiction. Police leverage on local media outlets appears insufficient to suppress imagery. Police-civilian public space interactions are often among the lowest level, highest stakes interactions in the United States. Police powers are restricted by systems which often depend on police cooperation. One organizational behavior pattern is that police will sometimes lie to protect themselves and other police, including perjury, making false reports, and destroying or denying the existence of video evidence of police misconduct. Technological developments underlying these problems are likely to continue along current paths. The stated issues have significant implications for the continued exercise of First Amendment rights in photographing public space, for Fourth Amendment protections against search and seizure and arrest without probable cause, and for police accountability. The research question is, What is the outcome of user-generated online video on police-civilian interactions in American public space? This descriptive multiple-case study based on document analysis of publicly available documents examined 14 police-civilian interactions in American public space between 2005-2010 for the influence (if any) of user-generated online video on their outcomes. Based on cross-case analysis of 38 variables of interest, generalizing to theory indicates that user-generated online video can improve accountability in police-civilian interactions. Several robust theories are proposed, and numerous opportunities for future research are delineated. Copies of dissertations may be obtained by addressing your request to ProQuest, 789 E.

AB  - This article documents the fact that ventures funded by two successful angel groups experience superior outcomes to rejected ventures: They have improved survival, exits, employment, patenting, Web traffic, and financing. We use strong discontinuities in angel- funding behavior over small changes in their collective interest levels to implement a regression discontinuity approach. We confirm the positive effects for venture operations, with qualitative support for a higher likelihood of successful exits. On the other hand, there is no difference in access to additional financing around the discontinuity. This might suggest that financing is not a central input of angel groups. © The Author 2011.

AB  - There is growing interest in the potential value of using phone applications that can monitor driver behaviour (Smartphone Driver Support Systems, ‘SDSSs’) in mitigating risky driving by young people. However, their value in this regard will only be realised if young people are willing to use this technology. This paper reports the findings of a study in which a novel structural model of willingness to use SDSSs was tested. Grounded in the driver monitoring and Technology Acceptance (TA) research literature, the model incorporates the perceived risks and gains associated with potential SDSS usage and additional social cognitive factors, including perceived usability and social influences. A total of 333 smartphone users, aged 18–24, with full Irish driving licenses completed an online questionnaire examining willingness or Behavioural Intention (BI) to uptake a SDSS. Following exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, structural equation modelling indicated that perceived gains and social influence factors had significant direct effects on BI. Perceived risks and social influence also had significant indirect effects on BI, as mediated by perceived gains. Overall, this model accounted for 72.5% of the variance in willingness to uptake SDSSs. Multi-group structural models highlighted invariance of effects across gender, high and low risk drivers, and those likely or unlikely to adopt novel phone app technologies. These findings have implications for our understanding of the willingness of young drivers to adopt and use SDSSs, and highlight potential factors that could be targeted in behavioural change interventions seeking to improve usage rates.

AB  - This paper presents various aspects of mobilities regimes. It shows that - from the body to the globe - modern life, economies and cultural activities are shaped and governed by powerful and influential sets of principles, norms and rules concerning physical, virtual and social mobility. Since the formulation of the 'new mobilities paradigm' approach questions of power and governance become increasingly relevant in theory and empirical research. The author presents four analytical dimensions helping to understand the power structures in mobilities: the normalization of mobility is discussed as an overarching process which involves the rationalization, subjectification, and time-space compression of modern mobilities. The paper argues for a research agenda that critically investigates the micro-, meso and macro-scalar dimensions of mobilities regimes in order to provide the ground for new policies of sustainable mobility.

AB  - Researchers attempting to survey refugees over time face methodological issues because of the transient nature of the target population. In this article, we examine whether applying smartphone technology could alleviate these issues. We interviewed 529 refugees and afterward invited them to four follow-up mobile web surveys and to install a research app for passive mobile data collection. Our main findings are as follows: First, participation in mobile web surveys declines rapidly and is rather selective with significant coverage and nonresponse biases. Second, we do not find any factor predicting types of smartphone ownership, and only low reading proficiency is significantly correlated with app nonparticipation. However, obtaining sufficiently large samples is challenging?only 5 percent of the eligible refugees installed our app. Third, offering a 30 Euro incentive leads to a statistically insignificant increase in participation in passive mobile data collection.

AB  - Due to a rising mobile device penetration, Web surveys are increasingly accessed and completed on smartphones or tablets instead of desktop computers or laptops. Mobile Web surveys are also gaining popularity as an alternative self-administered data collection mode among survey researchers. We conducted a methodological experiment among iPhone owners and compared the participation and response behavior of three groups of respondents: iPhone owners who started and completed our survey on a desktop or laptop PC, iPhone owners who self-selected to complete the survey on an iPhone, and iPhone owners who started on a PC but were requested to switch to iPhone. We found that respondents who completed the survey on a PC were more likely to be male, to have a lower educational level, and to have more experience with Web surveys than mobile Web respondents, regardless of whether they used the iPhone voluntarily or were asked to switch from a PC to an iPhone. Overall, iPhone respondents had more missing data and took longer to complete the survey than respondents who answered the questions on a PC, but they also showed less straightlining behavior. There are only minimal device differences on survey answers obtained from PCs and iPhones.

AB  - Researchers are combining self-reports from mobile surveys with passive data collection using sensors and apps on smartphones increasingly more often. While smartphones are commonly used in some groups of individuals, smartphone penetration is significantly lower in other groups. In addition, different operating systems (OSs) limit how mobile data can be collected passively. These limitations cause concern about coverage error in studies targeting the general population. Based on data from the Panel Study Labour Market and Social Security (PASS), an annual probability-based mixed-mode survey on the labor market and poverty in Germany, we find that smartphone ownership and ownership of smartphones with specific OSs are correlated with a number of sociodemographic and substantive variables. The use of weighting techniques based on sociodemographic information available for both owners and nonowners reduces these differences but does not eliminate them.

AB  - The rising penetration of smartphones now gives researchers the chance to collect data from smartphone users through passive mobile data collection via apps. Examples of passively collected data include geolocation, physical movements, online behavior and browser history, and app usage. However, to passively collect data from smartphones, participants need to agree to download a research app to their smartphone. This leads to concerns about nonconsent and nonparticipation. In the current study, we assess the circumstances under which smartphone users are willing to participate in passive mobile data collection. We surveyed 1,947 members of a German nonprobability online panel who own a smartphone using vignettes that described hypothetical studies where data are automatically collected by a research app on a participant's smartphone. The vignettes varied the levels of several dimensions of the hypothetical study, and respondents were asked to rate their willingness to participate in such a study. Willingness to participate in passive mobile data collection is strongly influenced by the incentive promised for study participation but also by other study characteristics (sponsor, duration of data collection period, option to switch off the app) as well as respondent characteristics (privacy and security concerns, smartphone experience).

AB  - IntroductionClosed-system transfer devices (CSTDs) were introduced into clinical practice to protect healthcare practitioners (HCPs) from exposure to hazardous drugs. However, ambiguous guidelines have led to confusion as to when CSTD use is required, as institutes are instructed to maintain their own hazardous drug lists and determine the appropriate level of personal protective equipment for their staff. This study seeks to understand the current use of CSTDs by Canadian oncology HCPs, the influence of various stakeholders on their use and the challenges faced by HCPs surrounding the use of these medical devices.MethodsThe researchers compiled a set of questions to inform on the current use of CSTDs in clinical practice and administered an online survey to oncology HCPs across Canada.ResultsThe results indicate that though CSTD use is common in Canadian oncology practice settings, there is variation in the extent of the use of these devices across provinces and with which products these devices are used. The survey results also show that the top challenges with the use of CSTDs include cost, lack of information on the compatibility of a CSTD with a drug product, and CSTD impact on drug quality. Many respondents are aligned that regulatory bodies are more likely to influence the use of CSTDs with specific drug products than drug manufacturers.ConclusionGuidelines for the application of CSTDs in clinical practice vary and are often ambiguous. Regulatory bodies are uniquely positioned to provide healthcare institutions with more clarity on when CSTD use is appropriate.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study was to investigate relationships among the experiential value of hotel apps, the cognitive and affective evaluation of hotel apps users, hotel apps users' satisfaction and their endorsement for the hotel apps. Specifically, this study examined the relationships that enhance hotel guests' experiences through hotel apps. Design/methodology/approach The measurement items were developed through extensive literature review. This study used a web-based survey to test an integrated model of the experiential value. With a total of 320 usable samples, partial least squares structural equation modeling was carried out to identify key "driver" constructs and validate the proposed model. Findings A significant relationship was found in the playfulness of hotel apps and hotel guests' cognitive and affective evaluations of the hotel apps, which positively influence hotel guests' satisfaction and their endorsement for the hotel apps. Hotel apps should create fun and entertainment features in the hotel apps so that the users of hotel apps can be enjoyable during their usage. In addition, providing hotel apps users with time saving and easy use of the hotel apps can affect their satisfaction and endorsement for the hotel apps. Originality/value This study confirmed the positive links among hotel apps users' experiential value, their cognitive and affective evaluation of the hotel apps, their satisfaction of using the hotel apps and their endorsement for the hotel apps. This study also revealed that hotel apps can be hotels' effective communication tool that enhances existing and potential customers' overall experiences.

AB  - Deviant behavior of adolescents in the online world has emerged as a serious social issue in South Korea. Given the urgent need to address new forms of risks related to technological advancement such as the Internet, this study examined the mechanisms of online deviant behavior among adolescents guided by general strain theory. Two waves of the nationally representative Korean Children and Youth Panel Study (N = 2184; Mage = 13.6 years) were used. The study examines whether the association between parental maltreatment (7th grade) and online deviant behavior (8th grade) is mediated by depression (8th grade), and further whether the mediating effect of depression (8th grade) on online deviant behavior (8th grade) is moderated by mobile phone dependency (8th grade). Depression mediated the relationship between parental maltreatment and online deviant behavior in the following year. A significant indirect and negative effect of parental maltreatment on online deviant behavior through depression was observed when levels of mobile phone dependency were low and moderate but not when mobile phone dependency was high. The findings demonstrated that adolescent’s depression and mobile phone dependency represent a key mechanism in determining the association between parental maltreatment and online deviant behavior. However, these findings may not be applicable for youth with the highest levels of mobile phone dependency.HighlightsAdopted general strain theory to examine the mechanism of online deviant behavior.Depression mediated the parental maltreatment and online deviant behavior relationship.Mobile phone dependency partially moderated the indirect effect of depression on online deviant behavior.

AB  - Based on four-wave panel data, this study explored the relationships between different uses of motivational mobile applications and online news engagement. Three motivational mobile application uses - informational, recreational, and relational - were identified and rank-ordered according to respondents' everyday mobile application preferences. Results showed that only relational mobile application use had positive relationships with online news engagement. Results further indicate that over the four-year period examined (2013-2016) only the use of relational mobile application led to continuous growth of online news engagement. This study advances the literature on mobile communication not only by introducing results of a longitudinal study that challenge and support conflicting previous findings but that also provide support for the possibility of the mobile facilitation hypothesis.

AB  - In this study, we assessed the status of electronic recruitment for U.S. state government employees and analyzed the issues and challenges state governments faced while they implemented e-recruitment systems. All of the 23 state personnel agencies that responded to a phone survey either offered downloadable application forms or allowed candidates to submit applications online. Ten states had adopted options for assessing applicants and selecting job candidates online, but only three states reported that they had adopted online testing. The number of applications received online increased from 2002 to 2003, and the most common implementation challenges that states faced when introducing e-recruitment were budget constraints, technical difficulties, and HR staff adapting to using a new system. While 15 states reported that they evaluated their electronic recruitment system, only three said they measured the cost per hire. Based on the survey responses, we conclude this article by presenting lessons and implications for effectively implementing e-recruitment for state government employees.

Data were collected through a student survey (n=1090) and focus groups with students (n=21) and semi-structured interviews with faculty members (n=4) were conducted. The findings suggested that the use of Tablet PCs with collaborative software promoted various types of faculty-student (e.g. real-time feedback, active engagement) and student-student interactions (e.g., online collaboration for co-located teams, virtual meetings). Additionally, students who use Tablet PCs in more courses showed higher level of engagement in classroom interactions. Recommendations for incorporating Tablet PCs into classrooms based on the findings are discussed.

AB  - Mobile instant messenger (mIM) service providers are extending their online services to the offline platform. Asia's largest mIM service providers, LINE and Kakao, are brining life to its signature characters such that they appear not only on the text screen but also on offline character flagship stores. This study investigates mIM users' motives in visiting the store and identifies the role of mIM characters in facilitating users' loyalty toward the mIM service provider. To comprehensively understand users' motivations in visiting the offline flagship store, the study conducted a focus group interview and used the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to identify seven key motivations. The empirical findings are drawn from 332 Korean respondents that use the mIM service and have experience in visiting the character flagship store. The study finds that users who actively use mIM services and emoticons are likely to visit the store due to the identified factors. A virtuous cycle of loyalty from online to the offline platform, and vice versa was also found. Findings of this study confirm that mIM character flagship stores are a strategic way for mIM service providers to communicate with users and create their unique brand identity. • The purpose of this research is to investigate the loyalty intentions of mIM users that are attached to the character emoticons. • To draw the research questions, we reviewed previous studies including the construal level theory, parasocial interaction theory, the theory of uses and gratification, and loyalty theory. • We found that users who actively use mIM services and emoticons are likely to visit the store due to the identified factors. • This research findings confirm that parasocial interaction and users' close psychological distance with emoticons encourage users to remain attached and loyal to the emoticon and the mIM service provider.

AB  - Adopting a re-materialization approach, we designed and implemented an everyday interactive artifact that enables an individual to monitor and establish the reconfirmation time of email data. This device represents a new means of handling and interacting with email. To investigate the value of the materialization of email data through a daily interactive object, Maili, we conducted a 1-month field study with five participants in their work environments. The results showed that applying physicality to email handling helped to increase accessibility to and interest in the data, as well as in the reconfirmation function of email. Results also indicated the value of combining non-digital (the tray) with digital functions. By presenting the process of using the dematerialized data, our findings offer new insights into how we can materialize digital information in everyday tangible artifacts.

AB  - Given the increasingly specific ways marketers can target ads, consumers and regulators are demanding ad transparency: disclosure of how consumers’ personal information was used to generate ads. We investigate how and why ad transparency impacts ad effectiveness. Drawing on literature about offline norms of information sharing, we posit that ad transparency backfires when it exposes marketing practices that violate norms about “information flows”—consumers’ beliefs about how their information should move between parties. Study 1 inductively shows that consumers deem information flows acceptable (or not) based on whether their personal information was: 1) obtained within versus outside of the website on which the ad appears, and 2) stated by the consumer versus inferred by the firm (the latter of each pair being less acceptable). Studies 2 and 3 show that revealing unacceptable information flows reduces ad effectiveness, which is driven by increasing consumers’ relative concern for their privacy over desire for the personalization that such targeting affords. Study 4 shows the moderating role of platform trust: when consumers trust a platform, revealing acceptable information flows increases ad effectiveness. Studies 5a and 5b, conducted in the field with a loyalty program website (i.e., a trusted platform), demonstrate this benefit of transparency.

AB  - Retailing industry has evolved drastically, especially in the past two decades due to the mobile technology. A recent empirical research study proved that the public use of mobile devices can be explained by the extension of the self, Hahn and Kim (2013) suggesting that fashion and appearance related constructs are imperative to understand young adult consumers’ mobile use intentions. With an aim to better understand the consumer’s mobile usage behavior, the researchers adopted psychographic characteristics such as fashion involvement, self-monitoring tendency, and proclivity of experimenting with appearance to gauge the individual consumers’ mobile dependency. Using an online and paper survey, we collected 273 usable responses from college-aged consumers. T-tests revealed that individuals, who had a higher degree of one’s sensitivity of self-monitoring, exhibited a significantly higher mean scores in fashion involvement, experimenting with appearance, and mobile dependency. A similar pattern was found among the ones with higher degree of ability of self-monitoring tendency as well. Discussion and pragmatic implications to the retail industry are provided.

Associated with sociology, traditional media and communication studies tend to understand media phenomena based on quantitative techniques such as a large-scale survey and statistical analysis, whose attempts often fail to grasp the highly personalized features of digital media. We need to accept the limitations of existing methods in investigating a new media phenomenon, and try to find alternative techniques to catch the dimension in which a particular technology acquires meaningful social relations with individuals. In this context, mobile media studies, as one of the most compelling signifiers of digital technology, seem to be able to play an experimental role in the verification of a new methodology. These attempts, in fact, are based on the recent speculation that the usage of mobile phones should not be investigated and described merely depending on a social communicational model. This chapter will introduce a theoretical struggle surrounding the contribution to media studies offered by reflexive ethnographic methods. Particularly, it will propose performance ethnography as a new possible way to describe digital media as a cultural craft, introducing an action research project on mobile media conducted by the author since 2009.

AB  - This study examined the factors affecting university students' resistance and intention to use of mobile learning by developing an integrated research model that combines innovation diffusion theory (IDT) and model of innovation resistance (MIR). We added the concepts of inertia and innovativeness to shed light on the personal aspects of students' adoption of mobile learning. Data were collected from a self–administered online survey of South Korean university students (N = 493). Structural equation results revealed that relative advantage, complexity, and inertia had significant effects on students' mobile learning resistance, with inertia being the most significant. Relative advantage, innovativeness, and mobile learning resistance had significant effects on students’ intention to use mobile learning, with relative advantage being the most significant. Furthermore, mobile learning resistance was found to mediate the effects of relative advantage and complexity on intention to use mobile learning. The results provide valuable implications for researchers and educational practitioners to develop and implement appropriate strategies for mobile learning.

AB  - This study attempts to examine the role of social support perception and emotional well-being on online information seeking among cancer patients within the context of CHESS, a well-established Interactive Cancer Communication System (ICCS). Factor and regression analyses conducted among 231 breast cancer patients revealed that social support perception and emotional well-being interacted with each other to influence online health information seeking. Patients with low social support perception and high emotional well-being were most likely to seek health information, whereas patients with high social support perception and high emotional well-being sought out the same information least. Practical implications of the study findings are further discussed. © 2013 International Communication Association.

AB  - In the era of perpetual digital connectedness, information and communication technology has significantly altered the way people communicate and interact with each other. Nonetheless, the computer-mediated communication should only complement offline communication rather than substituting it, as the resultant online ties are not as strong as face-to-face ties. In an effort to understand the motives in making offline social interactions real and ultimately to predict willingness to engage in serendipitous interactions with people encountered in a public place, we propose a place-aware social matching model driven by interpersonal factors (i.e., similarity, complementarity, and intimacy) and socio-spatial factors (i.e., place sociability, information acquisition expectancy, and perceived personal space in a place). Through a web-based social matching survey experiment (N = 1139 matches from 99 participants in Korea) based on a bogus stranger paradigm, we examine the interrelationship between those factors and the interaction willingness using a series of multiple regression analyses and build a prediction model by devising predictive features based on several machine learning models. From this, we find that both factors have statistically significant influence on interaction willingness, yet interpersonal factors have a higher relative importance than the socio-spatial factors. The interesting point is that the predictive power of these factors varies according to the place characteristics and the level of interaction willingness. We also empirically test the predictability of the model built from the controlled lab experiment through real-world experiments. The results reveal that the proposed model predicts interaction willingness in a real world with under 21% error rate within the Korean cultural context. Findings have implications for the design of mobile social networking systems that endeavor to facilitate serendipitous interactions.

In particular, little is known about how mobile users process and assess location information shared by their friends on Facebook. Undergirded by persuasion knowledge and elaboration likelihood models, a self-instructed online survey with 255 undergraduate students found that friendship tie strength was positively correlated with students' attitudes towards and perceived credibility of the location information shared by their Facebook friends. However, this relationship was true of those who reported a high level of mobile phone competence rather than those with low mobile phone competence.

AB  - Despite a nationwide lawful effort to regulate texting-while-driving behavior, little change has been reported. This study assessed the effect of current legal enforcement on attitudinal and behavioral responses toward texting while driving in conjunction with potential influences of two types of perceived norms legal and moral. An online survey was conducted with 313 college students recruited from three states where the history of a banning law of texting while driving varied (more than 3 years, less than 1 year, and none). The students self-reported perceived legal norm, perceived moral norm, perceived risk of texting while driving, frequency of texting while driving, attitude toward texting while driving, and intention of texting while driving. General linear model analyses revealed that the mere presence of legal enforcement showed a negative relationship with frequency of behavior only for the state with the banning law in effect more than 3 years. While the perceived legal norm showed inconsistent relationships with outcome variables, the perceived moral norm appeared most promising to discourage texting while driving among young drivers. A banning law for texting-while-driving behavior not only backfired on the actual behavior in a short-term effect, but also required a long-term exposure of the law to change the actual behavior among college students. On the other hand, cultivation of a moral norm to regulate the behavior of texting while driving is particularly encouraged in that the stable nature of this psychological variable can play a role to suppress possible reactance evoked by an external force. Policy makers are encouraged to harness their approach to regulate young drivers' texting while driving with the strategy that appeals to the drivers' moral beliefs rather than simply forcing them to comply with the law.

AB  - Given the popularity of checking in at a location via mobile phone, little research has examined the germane motivations tied to location check-in as a form of in-group electronic word-of-mouth and its relation to the concern of privacy. A survey with 255 college students found that the students' privacy concerns - both online and Facebook specific - did not show any relationship with the motivations of location check-in as a means of information sharing. However, the relationship varied among the non-users of location check-in on Facebook. Involvement with mobile phone showed mixed relationships with check in motivations commitment to Facebook, self-development and reputation, and promotional viral communication. Findings not only confirm that young Facebook users are relatively free from the concern of privacy during their location-based information sharing, but also suggest different motivational mechanisms to operate for Facebook users' viral communication depending on the habitualness of their mobile phone use. Implications are discussed for interpersonal marketing strategies on social networking sites. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Using an online national survey data collected during the 2012 South Korean Presidential campaign, this study examined whether and how partisan podcast consumption has an effect in activating the individuals' emotions towards candidates. This study also investigated whether citizens' such emotions consequently influenced political participation. The results showed that the more liberal a person was, the more they listened to a liberal podcast program, Naneun Ggomsuda. Such selective exposure to a liberal podcast program was positively associated with negative emotion and negatively related to positive emotion towards a conservative party presidential candidate. In contrast, the use of the liberal podcast was positively associated with positive emotion and negatively associated with negative emotion towards a liberal party presidential candidate. Both negative and positive emotions towards political candidates were significantly related with individuals' political participation. Most importantly, the results showed that the emotions mediated the relationship between partisan podcast use and political participation. Implications of the findings are discussed.

AB  - With the advances in mobile technologies, the ubiquitous tour information service has been emerging as a new solution for providing tour information. This study examined the effects of ubiquitous tour information service on perceived enjoyment and usage intention by tourists. The study begins with a preliminary survey of mobile device users' motives and perceptions of usage, followed by a review of the related literature. The measurements were derived from this process. The demonstrative analysis results classify the quality of ubiquitous tour information service into four categories: system quality, information quality, interface design, and convenience. Before analyzing the data, an exploratory factor analysis for reliability and validity assessment was conducted. Whereas the factors of interface design and convenience did not have a significant impact, the remaining two factors, system quality and information quality, impacted users' perceived enjoyment to a much greater extent. The four categories of ubiquitous tour information service were shown to affect usage intention. Of the four factors, system quality was found to have the highest impact on usage intention, followed by convenience, interface design, and information quality, in that order. The association between perceived enjoyment and usage intention was also supported. Based on the results, academic and managerial implications are discussed.

AB  - Given the large investments in mobile data services (MDS), it has become important to understand customers' decision-making processes as they pertain to the adoption and use of MDS. In the telecommunication domain, understanding the distinction between potential adopters and existing users is an important issue, as the use of information and communication technologies is associated with what has become known as the digital divide. This study attempts to develop a theoretical framework that identifies utilitarian and hedonic values as the key predictors of MDS acceptance and continuance. It also investigates the difference in the determinants between potential adopters and existing users. The proposed research model is empirically tested by using survey data collected from 120 potential adopters and 354 existing users. The results of structural equation modeling (SEM) show that the proposed research model provides a significant explanation of the variance of adoption intention and continued usage intention toward MDS. This study also clarifies the moderating role of direct experience with MDS in behavioral intention toward it. The results of this study would provide some guidelines to overcoming the digital divide in the context of MDS. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.

Four hundred and sixty-nine samples, which were collected from participants in a web-based survey in Korea, were analyzed using multiple regression analysis techniques. The results of the study show that corporate image, brand awareness, service price, and service quality are strong antecedents for establishing customer loyalty in mobile communications service markets. In addition, the empirical findings show that corporate image plays the most important role in establishing and maintaining customer loyalty in the markets. Based on the findings of the study, we discuss possible strategies for marketing success in high-tech service markets.

AB  - This research represents a theoretical extension of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), which IS researchers have used to explain technologies' perceived usefulness and individuals intention to use it. The authors developed a model, referred to as the Mobile Wireless Technology Acceptance Model (MWTAM), to test the relationship between theoretical constructs spanning technological influence processes (Perceived Ubiquity, and Perceived Reachability) and cognitive influence processes (Job Relevance, Perceived Usefulness, and Perceived Ease of Use) and their impact on Behavioral Intention. MWTAM is assessed using data collected from an online survey and analyzed using AMOS 5.0. Results provide evidence to support MWTAM as both the technological and cognitive influence processes accounted for 58.7% of the variance explained in an individual's Behavioral Intention toward using mobile wireless technology. Additionally, the path coefficients between constructs ranged from 0.241 to 0.572 providing further evidence to support the theoretical extension of TAM.

AB  - While eHealth technologies such as web-based interventions, mobile apps, and virtual reality have the potential to be of added value for forensic mental healthcare, there is a gap between this potential and the current situation in practice. The goal of this study was to identify recommendations to bridge this gap. In total, 21 semi-structured interviews and 89 questionnaires were conducted in a Dutch forensic mental healthcare sample consisting of professionals, patients, and eHealth experts. Based on the broad range of identified recommendations, it can be concluded that attention should be paid to the characteristics of professionals, patients, technology, and the organization throughout the development, implementation and evaluation of eHealth.

AB  - Aim: To investigate general practitioners’ (GPs’) desire and perceived added value of point-of-care (POC) troponin, its effect on referral decisions, and test requirements. Background: Excluding acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in primary care remains a diagnostic challenges for GPs. Consequently, referral rates of chest pain patients are high, while the incidence of a cardiovascular problem is only 8–15%. Previous studies have shown that GPs are interested in a POC troponin test. This test could enhance rapid exclusion of ACS, thereby preventing unnecessary patient distress, without compromising safety and while reducing costs. However, using this test is not recommended in current guidelines due to uncertainty in the test’s potential added value, and the lower sensitivity early after symptom onset as compared with troponin tests in a regular laboratory. Methods: An online survey containing 34 questions was distributed among 837 Dutch GPs in June 2015. Findings: A total of 126 GPs (15.1%) completed at least 75% of the questions. 67.1% of GPs believe that POC troponin tests have moderate to very high added value. Although the availability of a POC test is expected to increase the frequency at which troponin tests are used, it likely decreases (immediate) referral rates. Of the responding GPs, 78.3% only accept 10 min as the maximum test duration, 78.1% think reimbursement of the POC device is required for implementation, and 68.9% consider it necessary that it can be performed with a finger prick blood sample. In conclusion, according toGPs, the POC troponin test can be of added value to exclude ACS early on. Actual test implementation will depend on test characteristics, including test duration, type of blood sample required, and reimbursement of the analyzer.

AB  - Aim: To evaluate nurses' satisfaction with, and perceptions of, a practice innovation introducing a Mobile Admission Nurse service. Background: Staff nurses identified that the admission process, while crucial to initiating safe and appropriate acute care, can be disruptive and interfere with care in progress. A pilot project implementing the role of a Mobile Admission Nurse was introduced to address this need. Method: A self-developed web-based survey was administered to a convenience sample of 104 RNs who had used the services during the pilot project. Results: Staff nurses (n = 78) reported a chaotic, demanding work environment within which the admission process disrupts the flow of care. The Mobile Admission Nurse helped them in 'weathering the storm', which was the overarching theme that emerged during data analysis. Conclusions: Having an admission nurse complete the admission process steadied workflow processes for nurses. Improved patient safety and increased staff and family satisfaction were also reported. The strongly positive feedback led to expansion of the service. Implications for nursing management: Proactively redesigning work processes, using a structured theoretical model such as the (Plan–Do–Study–Act) PDSA approach, may improve outcomes in a chaotic practice environment.

AB  - The ubiquitous nature of technology today fosters the perception that its use as a means of information sharing and gathering occurs equally across resources. There is however a digital divide which commonly refers to the socio-economic, ethnic, educational, and cultural inequality of access and use of digital technologies in society today. Less clear in the literature is as Digital natives and Immigrants age and enter the workforce, how their age will affect their use of technology as a social and information gathering resource (Herring, 2008). Will advances in mobile technologies and age extend the digital divide or will they continue to be technology zealous? Based on data analyzed from wave 6 of the World Values Survey (WVS) a significant difference exists between the generations in the use of different information sources used for information gathering and sharing as they age.

AB  - Reality TV has inspired ongoing scholarly analysis of how formerly passive audience members are turned into active participants or even empowered citizens, but the actual encounters between media producers and media participants have been little explored. This article presents a detailed, critical study of the new interfaces to public visibility, combining an historical perspective with the in-depth study of production practices. Beginning with the several participatory forms of reality TV already established in the earliest days of broadcasting, I trace how audience members have long been recruited according to either a celebrity model or a citizen model of participation. I then demonstrate how these models are combined in the production of American Idol to support both its preparation and its presentation of participants, and how new media (online and mobile) are mobilized to both reinforce and capitalize upon this participation. Questioning the popular and scholarly hype surrounding the audience's "power" in reality TV, I conclude that the television industry is actually strengthening its grip on people in order to reduce costs and risks while increasing revenues in a time of uncertain financial prospects.

AB  - Objective To analyze the longitudinal data of multiple patients and to discover new temporal knowledge, we designed and developed the Visual Temporal Analysis Laboratory (ViTA-Lab). In this study, we demonstrate several of the capabilities of the ViTA-Lab framework through the exploration of renal-damage risk factors in patients with diabetes type II. Materials and methods The ViTA-Lab framework combines data-driven temporal data mining techniques, with interactive, query-driven, visual analytical capabilities, to support, in an integrated fashion, an iterative investigation of timeoriented clinical data and of patterns discovered in them. Patterns discovered through the data mining mode can be explored visually, and vice versa. Both analysis modes are supported by a rich underlying ontology of clinical concepts, their relations, and their temporal properties. The knowledge enables us to apply a temporal-abstraction pre-processing phase that abstracts in a context-sensitive manner raw time-stamped data into interval-based clinically meaningful interpretations, increasing the results' significance. We demonstrate our approach through the exploration of risk factors associated with future renal damage (micro-albuminuria and macro-albuminuria) and their relationship to the hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C ) and creatinine level concepts, in the longitudinal records of 22 000 patients with diabetes type II followed for up to 5 years. Results The iterative ViTA-Lab analysis process was highly feasible. Higher ranges of either normal albuminuria or normal creatinine values and their combination were shown to be significantly associated with future micro-albuminuria and macro-albuminuria. The risk increased given high HbA1C levels for women in the lower range of normal albuminuria, and for men in the higher range of albuminuria. Conclusions The ViTA-Lab framework can potentially serve as a virtual laboratory for investigations of large masses of longitudinal clinical databases, for discovery of new knowledge through interactive exploration, clustering, classification, and prediction.

AB  - Personal Information Management (PIM) refers to the practice and the study of how people acquire, organize, maintain, retrieve, archive and discard information for various reasons in physical and digital worlds. Many PIM tools are available for managing information on our desktop computers while many research prototypes have tried to augment or replace them. The development of these tools was based on knowledge drawn from the fields of psychology, human-computer interaction, information retrieval, knowledge management and research in the PIM field. Different metaphors and ways of organizing were introduced. However, the prevailing beliefs are that most of these prototypes were not extensively tested and that the radical design (not addressing real-world issues) and quick abandonment of prototypes prevented transfer to mainstream products. This paper looks at what has been developed and learnt, what has been transferred to mainstream applications, discusses the possible reasons behind these trends and challenges some parts of the above-mentioned beliefs.

AB  - Smartphones, with their ubiquitous presence, have become indispensable devices. Considerable research has been conducted on the pros and cons of mobile availability, but comparatively less research exists on different forms of mobile unavailability. Using an online factorial survey on 146 German smartphone users, the situational, usage-related, and personality-related factors influencing the perception of 72 systematically constructed fictitious scenarios of mobile unavailability were studied. Using a multilevel approach, the research revealed that the place, reason and duration of unavailability, and expectation of contact attempts influence situational mobile unavailability. Individual factors such as the significance of mobile availability, the availability expectations of friends, a disposition for FOMO (fear of missing out), and a high level of conscientiousness influence the perception of the unavailability scenarios. Furthermore, three cross-level effects between situational and individual factors are found.

AB  - Because numerous barriers hinder the assessment and management of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in clinical practice, the Carevive Care Planning System, a novel Web-based platform, was developed to address these barriers. It provides patients an opportunity to report their symptoms before their clinic visit and generates customizable care plans composed of evidence-basedmanagement strategies. The purpose of this study was to evaluate patient and provider perspectives of feasibility, usability, acceptability, and satisfaction with the Carevive platform. We used a single-arm, pretest/posttest, prospective design and recruited 25 women with breast cancer who were receiving neurotoxic chemotherapy and six advanced practice providers from an academic hospital. At three consecutive clinical visits, patients reported their neuropathy symptoms on a tablet via the Carevive system. The Diffusion of Innovations Theory served as an overarching evaluation framework. The Carevive platform was feasible to use. However, patients had higher ratings of usability, acceptability, and satisfaction with the platform than did the providers, who disliked the amount of time required to use the platform and had difficulty logging into Carevive. If issues regarding provider dissatisfaction can be addressed, the Carevive platform may aid in the screening of neuropathy symptoms and facilitate the use of evidence-based management strategies.

AB  - In contrast to the prominent individualistic view on self-disclosure, this study focuses on self-disclosure in groups of prior acquaintances that both meet offline and communicate online. It compares within-group self-disclosure between offline face-to-face (FtF) interactions and online communication via mobile messaging applications (MMAs). An online-survey (N = 357) was conducted to test for differences between within-group self-disclosure online and offline across four dimensions (amount, depth, breadth, valence). The results show that there is more amount, more breadth and more depth for offline within-group self-disclosure, but it is less positively valenced than online within-group self-disclosure. Interestingly, the mere frequency of communication is higher in an MMA environment. In spite of the permanent availability of the online communication sphere, group members do not permanently disclose personal information to each other online. Thus, for within-group self-disclosure, offline time seems quality time. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: In the past decade, the range of contraceptives available has increased dramatically. There are limited data on the factors that determine women's choices on contraceptive alternatives or what factors providers consider most important when recommending contraceptive products to women. Objectives: Our objectives were to compare women's (consumers') preferences and GPs' (providers') views in relation to existing and new contraceptive methods, and particularly to examine what factors increase the acceptability of different contraceptive products. Methods: A best-worst attribute stated-choice experiment was completed online. Participants (Australian women of reproductive age and Australian GPs) completed questions on 16 contraceptive profiles. 200 women of reproductive age were recruited through a commercial panel. GPs from all states of Australia were randomly sampled and approached by phone; 162 GPs agreed to participate. Participants chose the best and worst attribute levels of hypothetical but realistic prescribed contraceptive products. Best and worst choices were modelled using multinomial logit and product features were ranked from best to worst according to the size of model coefficients. Results: The most attractive feature of the contraceptive products for both GPs and women consumers were an administration frequency of longer than 1 year and light or no bleeding. Women indicated that the hormonal vaginal ring was the least attractive mode of administration. Conclusions: Women and GPs agree that longer-acting methods with less bleeding are important features in preferred methods of contraception; however, women are also attracted to products involving less invasive modes of administration. While the vaginal ring may fill the niche in Australia for a relatively non-invasive, moderately long-acting and effective contraceptive, the results of this study indicate that GPs will need to promote the benefits of the vaginal ring to overcome negative perceptions about this method among women who may benefit from using it.

AB  - This study compared learner perspectives regarding using PCs and smartphones as learning devices. A total of 167 Korean university students completed online assignments designed to maximize interaction with these devices. The assignments required students to submit their responses regarding assigned reading passages for a semester. Then they completed an online survey of five questions: (a) most frequently used device; (b) reasons for favoring a particular device; (c) limitations of a particular device; (d) better device for facilitating cognitive effort; (e) places where they used a particular device. The results showed that half the participants used PCs and the other half used smartphones. PC users favored ‘comfortable use,’ whereas smartphone users favored ‘ubiquitous learning.’ PC users reported ‘not easily portable’ was the most prominent limitation, whereas smartphone users pointed out ‘using smartphone's costly data’ and ‘uncomfortable to drag/move’ were noticeable limitations. In general however, the majority of both PC and smartphone users reported no limitations in using these devices as learning tools. Regarding facilitating cognitive effort, around 38.0% of participants indicated that there was no difference between these two devices. Most PC users did online assignments either at home or in a dormitory. Smartphone users completed tasks in several different places. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Technological Displacement: The Coat Check Interactive AR Installation in Perspective is a two-part dissertation that involves the research/creation of an augmented reality installation and a textual critique of displacement both as a socio-cultural phenomenon and a technology-driven status quo. Digital technologies involve a series of displacements from data storage and transfer to creating global networks. Going hand in hand with human mobilities technological displacement affects our lives and interactions deeply. Multimedia and digital overlaying of information and interconnectedness (mobile devices, tracking technologies, the internet...) make up our quotidian in various degrees, impelling us to be 'present' in time and places we actually are not. Technological displacement may be viewed as an extension of physical displacement of individuals and communities in that the need to reconcile, re-invent and innovatively market proximity becomes more and more an underlying theme of contemporary lives. Nowhere the reorientations of presence is more accentuated than 'augmented space', as described by Lev Manovich, ' a physical space overlaid with dynamically changing information, multimedia in form and localized for each user.'(219) It may be argued that our sense of reality is already 'augmented' by digital stimuli in many ways. Here I make the case that in an augmented or digitally enhanced environment we are displaced multiple times, or 'multiplaced'. Augmentation is superimposing multimedia to real space, blurring the boundary between the real and the virtual, creating a heterogeneous space defined neither by the standards of the virtual nor the real but the coexistence and cooperation of both. Augmented reality functions on the principle of multiple displacements in that real space is not a backdrop to multimedia: it is indispensable to the overall embodied experience. I created The Coat Check in 2011 using motion tracking technologies (Intersense IS900), specialized cameras (Point Grey 360^' Spherical Vision Camera), screens (FogScreen), software (Max/MSP), tools and applications (Snapdragon AR). The conceptualization of The Coat Check is based on an analogy between digital technologies and coat checks that are both storage, retrieval and displacement systems. The Coat Check also raises questions on identity and history as it refers to belonging, temporality, and mobility. This project is inspired by the work of Mona Hatoum and Kutlug Ataman. Both artists' installations focus on the dialectics of the interior and exterior, past and present, memory and amnesia. This research originates from questions of identity, mobility and memory and evolves towards an understanding of technological displacement.

AB  - An online survey of 624 respondents was divided evenly between men and women, with exactly 104 subjects in each of the six generational groupings. The respondents' occupational and other demographic characteristics do not deviate significantly from Japanese averages comprising a good cross-representational Japanese sample. A pre-Olympic survey was conducted on August 6-7, followed by a second survey carried out after the Olympics on September 1-2, 2008. Audience images of China and the Chinese improved as a result of exposure to media content during the Olympics period, although the improvements varied in degree somewhat depending on the issue at hand. As for reported audience attitudes towards China and the Chinese, the pre- to post-Olympic shifts were far less significant than observations of stable (i.e. apparently not significantly influenced by Olympics media coverage) attitudes/impressions in line with the audience members' individual ideological orientation. Among the ideological-type groups, those in the 'National Regime'-oriented group had more salient and robust attitudes, in general, towards many items surveyed in the research. In terms of the reported preferred media use, the audience was categorised into three groups: newspaper readers/radio listeners, television watchers/Internet users and cellular phone users. Each group displayed similar tendencies regarding the relationship of individual ideological orientation and these individuals' respective evaluations of China/Chinese.

AB  - Purpose: A questionnaire survey was conducted to collect information from clinical audiologists about rehabilitation options for adult patients who report significant auditory difficulties despite having normal or near-normal hearing sensitivity. This work aimed to provide more information about what audiologists are currently doing in the clinic to manage auditory difficulties in this patient population and their views on the efficacy of recommended rehabilitation methods. Method: A questionnaire survey containing multiple-choice and open-ended questions was developed and disseminated online. Invitations to participate were delivered via e-mail listservs and through business cards provided at annual audiology conferences. All responses were anonymous at the time of data collection. Results: Responses were collected from 209 participants. The majority of participants reported seeing at least one normal-hearing patient per month who reported significant communication difficulties. However, few respondents indicated that their location had specific protocols for the treatment of these patients. Counseling was reported as the most frequent rehabilitation method, but results revealed that audiologists across various work settings are also successfully starting to fit patients with mild-gain hearing aids. Responses indicated that patient compliance with computer-based auditory training methods was regarded as low, with patients generally preferring device-based rehabilitation options. Conclusions: Results from this questionnaire survey strongly suggest that audiologists frequently see normal-hearing patients who report auditory difficulties, but that few clinicians are equipped with established protocols for diagnosis and management. While many feel that mild-gain hearing aids provide considerable benefit for these patients, very little research has been conducted to date to support the use of hearing aids or other rehabilitation options for this unique patient population. This study reveals the critical need for additional research to establish evidence-based practice guidelines that will empower clinicians to provide a high level of clinical care and effective rehabilitation strategies to these patients.

AB  - Objective: Eating disorder recovery research has emphasized the absence of symptoms over the presence of adaptive aspects like positive body image and healthy eating attitudes. The current study examined how body appreciation and intuitive eating related to eating disorder recovery using a comprehensive recovery definition (physical, behavioral, and cognitive recovery). Method: Data were collected from 66 women with an eating disorder history and 31 controls with no history of eating pathology. Participants completed an online survey followed by a phone interview. Results: The fully recovered group did not differ from controls on body appreciation, with both groups endorsing significantly higher levels of body appreciation than the partially recovered and current eating disorder groups. Similarly, the fully recovered group did not differ from controls on overall intuitive eating, with both groups endorsing significantly higher levels of overall intuitive eating than the partially recovered and current eating disorder groups. Discussion: Positive psychological constructs such as body appreciation and intuitive eating relate to eating disorder recovery status. Understanding recovery within a strengths-based framework may inform intervention and relapse prevention. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Problem: Reflecting on workplace-based experiences is necessary for professional development. However, residents need support to raise their awareness of valuable moments for learning and to thoughtfully analyze those learning moments afterwards. Approach: From October to December 2012, the authors held a multidisciplinary six-week postgraduate training module focused on general competencies. Residents were randomly assigned to one of four conditions with varying degrees of reflection support; they were offered (1) a smartphone app, (2) coaching group sessions, (3) a combination of both, or (4) neither type of support. The app allowed participants to capture in real time learning moments as a text note, audio recording, picture, or video. Coaching sessions held every two weeks aimed to deepen participants’ reflection on captured learning moments. Questionnaire responses and reflection data were compared between conditions to assess the effects of the app and coaching sessions on intensity and frequency of reflection. Outcomes: Sixty-four residents participated. App users reflected more often, captured more learning moments, and reported greater learning progress than nonapp users. Participants who attended coaching sessions were more alert to learning moments and pursued more follow-up learning activities to improve on the general competencies. Those who received both types of support were most alert to these learning moments. Next Steps: A simple mobile app for capturing learning moments shows promise as a tool to support workplace-based learning, especially when combined with coaching sessions. Future research should evaluate these tools on a broader scale and in conjunction with residents’ and students’ personal digital portfolios.

AB  - Surveys are a vital tool for understanding public opinion and knowledge, but they can also yield biased estimates of behavior. Here we explore a popular and important behavior that is frequently measured in public opinion surveys: news consumption. Previous studies have shown that television news consumption is consistently overreported in surveys relative to passively collected behavioral data. We validate these earlier findings, showing that they continue to hold despite large shifts in news consumption habits over time, while also adding some new nuance regarding question wording. We extend these findings to survey reports of online and social media news consumption, with respect to both levels and trends. Third, we demonstrate the usefulness of passively collected data for measuring a quantity such as "consuming news"for which different researchers might reasonably choose different definitions. Finally, recognizing that passively collected data suffers from its own limitations, we outline a framework for using a mix of passively collected behavioral and survey-generated attitudinal data to accurately estimate consumption of news and related effects on public opinion and knowledge, conditional on media consumption.

AB  - Purpose Building information modeling (BIM) and lean construction are two practices that are developed in order to increase productivity, efficiency and quality in construction by implementing various procedures. However, the practical execution of both BIM and lean is mostly limited with the tasks performed in the office environments in the design phase. The purpose of this paper is to examine the benefit realizations in terms of lean interactions resulting from mobile BIM processes through a framework by focusing on digital transformations performed on the construction site.
Design/methodology/approach This paper examines the benefit realizations in terms of lean interactions resulting from mobile BIM processes through a framework by focusing on digital transformations performed on the construction site. To describe the case, BIM project management processes during construction phase have been explained by a participatory research. With a comprehensive literature review, interactions between site BIM processes and lean principles have been defined and the case has been evaluated accordingly.
Findings By focusing on the mobile BIM delivery of project information via tablets to construction site, it has been identified that through the use of technology enabled by BIM practices, lean construction principles are also simultaneously accomplished. This achievement is not only realized with technology but also with the strategic implementation and transformation of organization with the proper BIM practices.
Research limitations/implications The research is focused on mobile BIM processes applied on-site to enhance traditional project management processes. With the findings of this paper, practitioners may identify research questions to resolve real-life implementation challenges.
Practical implications This research will enlighten construction practitioners regarding site BIM application capabilities and lean achievements with the utilization of improved project management processes enabled by BIM.
Originality/value Through the implementation of project management processes enabled by BIM practices on construction site, lean principles are achieved and bottlenecks are identified.

AB  - Introduction: Glycerin (VG) and propylene glycol (PG) are the most common nicotine solvents used in e-cigarettes (ECs). It has been shown that at high temperatures both VG and PG undergo decomposition to low molecular carbonyl compounds, including the carcinogens formaldehyde and acetaldehyde. The aim of this study was to evaluate how various product characteristics, including nicotine solvent and battery output voltage, affect the levels of carbonyls in EC vapor. Methods: Twelve carbonyl compounds were measured in vapors from 10 commercially available nicotine solutions and from 3 control solutions composed of pure glycerin, pure propylene glycol, or a mixture of both solvents (50:50). EC battery output voltage was gradually modified from 3.2 to 4.8 V. Carbonyl compounds were determined using the HPLC/DAD method. Results: Formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were found in 8 of 13 samples. The amounts of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde in vapors from lower voltage EC were on average 13- and 807-fold lower than in tobacco smoke, respectively. The highest levels of carbonyls were observed in vapors generated from PG-based solutions. Increasing voltage from 3.2 to 4.8 V resulted in a 4 to more than 200 times increase in formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acetone levels. The levels of formaldehyde in vapors from high-voltage device were in the range of levels reported in tobacco smoke. Conclusions: Vapors from EC contain toxic and carcinogenic carbonyl compounds. Both solvent and battery output voltage significantly affect levels of carbonyl compounds in EC vapors. High-voltage EC may expose users to high levels of carbonyl compounds.

AB  - Introduction: The tobacco industry uses various aspects of cigarette packaging design to market to specific groups. The current study examined the relative importance of five cigarette packaging attributes-pack structure (eg, "slims"), brand, branding, warning label size, and price-on perceptions of product taste, harm, and interest in trying, among young females in Canada. Methods: A discrete choice experiment was conducted with smoking and nonsmoking females, aged 16 to 24 (N = 448). Respondents were shown 10 choice sets, each containing four packs with different combinations of the attributes: pack structure (slim, lipstick, booklet, traditional); brand ("Vogue," "du Maurier"); branding (branded, plain); warning label size (50%, 75%); and price ($8.45, $10.45). For each choice set, respondents chose the brand that they: (1) would rather try, (2) would taste better, and (3) would be less harmful, or "none." For each outcome, the attributes' impact on consumer choice was analyzed using a multinomial logit model. Results: The multinomial logit analyses revealed that young females weighted pack structure to be most important to their intention to try (46%), judgment of product taste (52%), and judgment of product harm (48%). Price and branding were weighted important in trial intent decisions (23% and 18%, respectively) and product taste judgments (29% and 15%, respectively). Whereas warning label size and brand were weighted important when judging product harm (23% and 17%, respectively). Conclusion: The findings suggest that standardized cigarette packaging may decrease demand and reduce misleading perceptions about product harm among young females.

AB  - Global security has been at the top of the international agenda during the last decade and is very likely to remain high-ranking in the years to come. Especially in the light of the international threat of terrorism, an additional budget and powers have been put at the disposal of nation states across the globe to counter threats and to maximize global and national security. Only recently broader attention has been generated to look into the unintended side-effects of the efforts of all those states. Especially the revelations by the American whistleblower Edward Snowden have raised questions about the scale of the efforts to maximize global security, for example, by the surveillance of global communications. The Norwegian Helsinki Committee recommends in this context to further clarity the judicial framework of internet and mobile phone surveillance and suggests that the OSCE should become a pioneer in setting standards for states to respect the right to privacy online.

AB  - Die zunehmende Prävalenz intelligenter mobiler Geräte (z.B. Smartphones) ermöglicht die kombinierte Nutzung von Mobile Crowdsensing (MCS) und ökologischen Momentanbewertungen (EMA) im Gesundheitsbereich. Durch die Korrelation von qualitativen longitudinalen und ökologisch validen EMA-Bewertungsdatensätzen mit Sensormessungen in mobilen Apps können neue wertvolle Erkenntnisse über Patienten (z.B. Menschen, die an chronischen Krankheiten leiden) gewonnen werden. Allerdings gibt es zahlreiche konzeptionelle, architektonische und technische, sowie rechtliche Herausforderungen bei der Implementierung einer entsprechenden Softwarelösung. Daher identifiziert die vorliegende Arbeit (1) diese Herausforderungen, (2) leitet entsprechende Empfehlungen ab und (3) schlägt eine Referenzarchitektur für eine MCS-EMA-Plattform vor, die die definierten Empfehlungen berücksichtigt. Die erforderlichen Erkenntnisse, um die Referenzarchitektur vorzuschlagen, wurden in mehreren groß angelegten mHealth-Crowdsensing-Studien gewonnen, die seit vielen Jahren und zu verschiedenen Fragen der Gesundheitsversorgung durchgeführt werden. Um nur zwei Beispiele zu nennen: Wir führen Crowdsensing-Studien zu Fragen im Zusammenhang mit der chronischen Tinnitus-Erkrankung oder psychischem Stress durch. Wir betrachten die vorgeschlagene Referenzarchitektur und die identifizierten Herausforderungen und Empfehlungen als einen Beitrag in zweierlei Hinsicht. Erstens ermöglichen sie es anderen Forschern, unsere praktischen Studien an einer Ausgangssituation auszurichten, die die verschiedenen aufgedeckten Einsichten befriedigen kann. Zweitens sind sie eine geeignete Grundlage für einen besseren Vergleich von Daten, die mit MCS und EMA erhoben wurden. Darüber hinaus erfordert der kombinierte Einsatz von MCS und EMA zunehmend geeignete Architekturen und damit verbundene digitale Lösungen für den Gesundheitsbereich. (translated by DeepL)

AB  - This article analyses the crucial role of user data for digital markets contestability and presents policy proposals devised to address growing concerns about the dominance of data-rich incumbents in digital markets. To this end, we discuss a data-driven theory of harm that would warrant ex-ante data access regulation and highlight that niche entry and growth should be the primary economic policy objective in digital markets characterized by strong data-driven network effects. We then evaluate regulatory data access remedies with respect to the involved economic trade-offs and their effectiveness for promoting niche entry and growth. Firstly, we analyse remedies that would limit the collection of user data by data-rich incumbents such as data silos and line of business restrictions. Secondly, we consider remedies that facilitate sharing of (user) data by opening up access to raw behavioural user data collected by data-rich incumbents. In particular, we propose a dual approach with two complementary types of data access remedies: bulk sharing of broad anonymized raw user data and continuous, real-time data portability of deep raw data that contain personally identifiable information. Finally, we comment on the recent proposal for a Digital Markets Act by the European Commission with respect to our findings.

AB  - With many ways for consumers to access and consume music, little is known about why people choose to listen to music via one format over another. Using a uses and gratifications approach, the present research used an online questionnaire (N = 396) to examine people's format use, concerning six particular formats. The results suggest that eight dimensions, namely, usability and intention to use, discovery, functional utility, flexibility, connection, social norms, value for money, and playback diversity, define the uses and gratifications that particular formats serve. When considering whether format use was related to broader music engagement behaviors, results indicated different associations between music engagement variables and format use suggesting that different formats allow listeners to engage with music in unique ways. Findings have implications for future research that examines how and why people engage with music listening in everyday life, elaborating further our understanding of how selection of particular formats can lead to different listening experiences.

AB  - The effects of scale direction on response behavior are well known in the survey literature, where a variety of theoretical approaches are discussed, and mixed empirical findings are reported. In addition, different types of survey completion devices seem to vary in their susceptibility to scale direction effects. In this study, we therefore investigate the effect of scale direction and device type on response behavior in PC and smartphone surveys. To do so, we conducted a web survey experiment in a German non-probability access panel (N=3,401) using a two-step split-ballot design with four groups that are defined by device type (PC and smartphone) and scale direction (decremental and incremental). The results reveal that both PCs and smartphones are robust against scale direction effects. The results also show that response behavior differs substantially between PCs and smartphones, indicating that the device type (PC or smartphone) matters. In particular, the findings show that the comparability of data obtained through multi-device surveys is limited.

AB  - Many companies compete globally in a world in which user ratings and price are important drivers of performance but whose importance may differ by country. This study builds on the cultural, economic, and structural differences across countries to examine how app popularity reacts to price and ratings, controlling for product characteristics. Estimated across 60 countries, a dynamic panel model with product-specific effects reveals that price sensitivity is higher in countries with higher masculinity and uncertainty avoidance. Ratings valence sensitivity is higher in countries with higher individualism and uncertainty avoidance, while ratings volume sensitivity is higher in countries with higher power distance and uncertainty avoidance and those that are richer and have more income equality. For managers, the authors visualize country groups and calculate how much price should decrease to compensate for a negative review or lack of reviews. For researchers, they highlight the moderators of the volume and valence effects of online ratings, which are becoming ubiquitous in this connected world.

AB  - Purpose: Although mobile devices are ubiquitous among employees, their awareness and readiness to use mobile technologies for competence development is still not widespread and therefore requires further exploration. The purpose of this study is to propose a conceptual model based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) to explain the determinants that affect employees’ intention to use mobile devices and software for knowledge transfer during the process of knowledge management. Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual model based on the UTAUT with new variables concerning relative usability (RU) and user autonomy (UA) and new connections between the determinants was developed as a result of a subject matter literature review. A structural equation modelling approach was used to validate the model on the basis of data collected via a survey collected from 371 employees from 21 sectors, both public and private. Findings: The UTAUT model extended by new variables like RU and UA explains employee acceptance of mobile technologies for knowledge transfer reasonably well. New proposed variables highlighted that the usability of technology compared to other solutions and user autonomy in the selection and the use of applications have the strongest impact on the employees’ intention to use mobile devices and software for knowledge transfer. Research limitations/implications: This model explains the 55 per cent behavioral intention of employees to use mobile technologies for knowledge transfer. Even though it is quite high in terms of acceptance theories, some new variables should be explored. Furthermore, study does not verify whether m-learning acceptance for knowledge transfer is sector-specific. Practical implications: Mobile technologies used for knowledge transfer by employees should allow for high UA through their ability to select solutions that they find convenient, use of preferred platforms, personalize applications and utilize devices and software in various environments. They should not be simplified and should have the same functionality and efficiency of use as alternative solutions like web and desktop applications, even if additional effort to learn them would be required. Mobile technologies that take into account UA and RU support the process of employees capturing, distributing and effectively using knowledge. Originality/value: The elaborated model provides a valuable solution with practical implications for increasing mobile technologies acceptance for knowledge transfer. The study results contribute both to knowledge management and technology acceptance research fields by introducing two new determinants for the acceptance of technologies in knowledge transfer, such as UA and RU with several additional connections between existing UTAUT variables.

AB  - The acceptance of mobile technologies by employees is critical to their successful implementation in the workplace for competence development. Consequently, the type of job position (TJP) held was proposed as a new technology acceptance moderator and its significance verified. To examine this new moderator's role in explaining employees' intention to use technology, particularly mobile devices and applications for knowledge transfer, an extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model was elaborated that included the TJP moderator. A structural equation modelling approach was used to validate the model on the basis of data collected via a survey received from 810 employees from Poland, from 26 sectors, both public and private. The study results highlight that TJP moderates the significance and strength of selected factors influencing technology acceptance, such as: user autonomy, relative usability, social influence, performance expectancy, effort expectancy and facilitating conditions. Moreover social influence was confirmed to impact the behavioral intention to use mobile technologies for knowledge transfer for managers only. Inversely, user autonomy influence on perceived effort required to use mobile learning shown to exist for all TJP moderator values except for managers. Theoretical and practical implications of study are discussed.

AB  - This paper describes a novel instantiation of a digital photo library in a public access system. It demonstrates how designers can utilize characteristics of a target user community (social constraints, trust, and a lack of anonymity) to provide capabilities, such as unrestricted annotation and uploading of photos, which would be impractical in other types of public access systems. It also presents a compact set of design principles and guidelines for ensuring the immediate usability of public access information systems. These principles and guidelines were derived from our experience developing PhotoFinder Kiosk, a community photo library. Attendees of a major HCI conference (CHI 2001 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems) successfully used the tool to browse and annotate collections of photographs spanning 20 years of HCI-related conferences, producing a richly annotated photo history of the field of human-computer interaction. Observations and usage log data were used to evaluate the tool and develop the guidelines. They provide specific guidance for practitioners, as well as a useful framework for additional research in public access interfaces. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Social media have become a central source for news and current affairs information. This article focuses on the overarching attributes that shape how people come in contact with news, engage with news, and are affected by news on social media. Although all social media are different and change constantly, news experiences on these platforms can consistently be characterized as personalized, incidental, non-exclusive, as well as granularized and social (PINGS). Accordingly, this article introduces the PINGS framework, which acts as a systematization of social media news experiences and can be used to map key opportunities and challenges of using news across various social media platforms. In addition to presenting the framework components, the article also discusses how researchers can investigate PINGS in empirical studies.

AB  - This paper investigates issues related to the use of mobile phones by people aged 60 years and over and characteristics of an ageing-friendly mobile phone. This study combines qualitative and quantitative analysis methods of Delphi interviews, focus group discussions, and online survey. The expert interviews and the focus group discussions covered usage patterns, problems, benefits, and desired and unwanted features. The issues raised in the discussions were translated into an online survey of 100 people. This study revealed that older people are passive users of mobile phones, that they experience fear of consequences of using unfamiliar technology, and that most preferred design features are aids for declining functional abilities. Gender differences in preferred design features were observed, with women focusing on haptic aids and men on perceptual aids. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - PurposeThe objective of this study is to examine the causal relationship between economic growth, information and communication technology (ICT) penetration and innovation development in OECD countries.Design/methodology/approachThis study incorporates data for 24 OECD countries from 2000 to 2018, which is divided into the earliest (2000–2009) and the latest (2010–2018) periods. The econometric methodologies of this study employ panel cointegration, estimation procedures and vector error-correction modelling to investigate the potential interconnections between ICT, innovation development and economic growth.FindingsThe results from the latest period illustrate that OECD countries have achieved positive and significant economic development from high ICT penetration, while results from the earliest period show that OECD countries were just beginning to enjoy the benefits of ICT penetration. Moreover, findings show that innovation development is highly significant in the latest period when promoting economic growth.Practical implicationsThe policy implications suggest that promoting ICT infrastructure establishment and expanding the innovation development may drive the process of economic development in OECD countries.Originality/valueThis study employs mobile and Internet penetration as the development of telecommunication which is in line with the enlargement of innovation to foster economic growth in OECD countries. Comparing the evidence from two decades provides significant value for policymakers and decision-makers regarding the advantages of technology expansion and innovation development to promote economic growth in recent conditions.

AB  - This study explored information and communication technology (ICT) uses for protest politics, focusing on the case of a 2008 protest in Korea. Based on a survey of citizen activists (N = 322), it examined informational and coordinative uses of eight different ICTs for protest participation. The results indicated that heavy, moderate, and nonprotesters were differentiated, particularly regarding the use of Web sites of social movement organizations (SMOs), mobile phone, and e-mail. Across all types of protesters, the portal site was the most prominently utilized tool, while online micromedia showed little contribution. The findings call for the reconsideration of the waning role of SMOs in contemporary protest politics, and the differentiation of the public-oriented ICT from the private use of ICT regarding its contribution to expand civil society.

AB  - Screens, as technological but also narrative and social devices, alter reading and writing practices. Users consume vids, read stories on the Web, and produce creative contents on blogs or Web archives, etc. Uses of seriality and transmediality are here discussed, that is watching, reading, and writing as interpreting, as well as respective and reciprocal uses of iteration and interaction (with technologies and with others). A specific figure of users or readers will be defined as a skilful and literate audience: fans on archives (FanFiction.net-FFNet, and Archive of Our Own-AO3). Fans produce serial and transmedia narratives based upon their favourite TV Shows, publish on-line, and often produce discourses or meta-discourse on this writing practice or on writing in general. The broader perspective of reception studies allows us to develop a three-step methodology that develops into a process. The first step is an ethnographic approach based on practices and competencies of users. The second step develops and clarifies the ethnographic dimension into an ethno-narrative approach, which aims at analysing mutual links between signs, texts, and uses of reading and writing. The main question is that of significance and meaning. The third step elaborates upon interactions in a technological and mediated environment. Social, participative, or collaborative and multimodal dimensions of interacting are yet regarded as key elements in reshaping a reading-writing cultural practice. The model proposed is a socio-narrative device, which hangs upon three dimensions: techno-narrative, narratological, and socio-narrative. These three dimensions of a shared narrative universe illustrate the three steps process. Each step also offers specific uses of interacting: an ethnographic approach of fictional expectation, a narrative ethnography of iteration and transformation, and a socio-narrative perspective on dialogism and recognition. A specific but significant example of fans' uses of reading and interacting will illustrate each step of the methodology. This qualitative approach of individual uses aims to be representative of fans' cultural practice (See Appendix 1). We will discuss cultural uses of appropriation. How do reading, interpreting, writing, and rewriting, that is to say interacting, produce meaning, create identities, and build up our relation to others and to the (story)world? Given our interest in embodied and appropriated meanings, appropriation will be revealed as an open cultural process, which can question the conflict and/or the convergence of the old and the new in cultural practices, and the way former and formal dichotomies have to be re-evaluated. We will take an interest in the composition of meaning that unfolds a cultural and critical process, from acknowledgement to recognition, a process where iteration and transformation are no longer opposites but part of a continuum.

AB  - This paper proposes an ecological view to investigate how disparities in mobile technology use reflect vulnerabilities in communities vis-a-vis disaster preparedness. Data (n=1,603) were collected through a multi-country survey conducted equally in rural and urban areas of Indonesia, Myanmar, Philippines, and Vietnam, where mobile technology has become a dominant and ubiquitous communication and information medium. The findings show that smartphone users' routinised use of mobile technology and their risk perception are significantly associated with disaster preparedness behaviour indirectly through disaster-related information sharing. In addition to disaster-specific social support, smartphone users' disaster-related information repertoires are another strong influencing factor. In contrast, non-smartphone users are likely to rely solely on receipt of disaster-specific social support as the motivator of disaster preparedness. The results also reveal demographic and rural-urban differences in disaster information behaviour and preparedness. Given the increasing shift from basic mobile phone models to smartphones, the theoretical and policy-oriented implications of digital disparities and vulnerability are discussed.

AB  - Recruiting participants through gatekeepers has been widely discussed in qualitative research. However, when a sampling frame is not available, surveying through gatekeepers can also be important for quantitative studies. We used three sampling methods to survey guardians of University students: (a) a gatekeeper variant of the time-space sampling, (b) a direct postal survey to a random sample of guardians' addresses, and (c) a phone survey of the general population. The gatekeeper survey was the most efficient, but yielded a skewed sample. Albeit skewed, the gatekeeper sample yielded the same responses as the random sample, on five theoretically important scales (N = 29 questions). In-depth personal interviews and online semi-structured questionnaires with guardians and students revealed a two-way gatekeeping mechanism within families, regulating guardians' participation in the study. We discuss the indispensable contribution of qualitative data in our study and provide methodological suggestions for practitioners.

AB  - Ratings of severity and frequency of engagement with distracting driver behaviours are reported in this paper. Survey data were collected using an anonymous online questionnaire. Four hundred eighty-two respondents contributed to the survey during a 2 month data collection period. Results indicate that the three behaviours rated as most distracting when driving were (i) writing text messages (41%), (ii) reading text messages (62%), and (iii) using a cellular telephone hand-held (52%). The three most frequently reported distracting behaviours that resulted in accidents were (i) ‘interaction with child passengers’ 2.1% (near misses = 7.5%), (ii) both, route guidance destination entry with 2% (near misses = 2.8%) and use of an ‘… add-on media device, e.g., an iPod’ with 2% (near misses = 3.9%), and (iii) the three items ‘reading a text message’, ‘following advice from a route guidance system’, and ‘interaction with pets’, all with 1.7% of respondents reporting an accident when undertaking the activity (with 6.5%, 3%, and 2.2% respectively for near misses). Two hierarchical regression models were explored. The first introducing personal factors, i.e., age, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability and intellect (R² = 0.131, p < 0.001). The second controlled for variables in the first model and introduced driver-related variables, mileage, penalty points, and frequency of accidents with assumed responsibility (R² = 0.253, p < 0.001). This model identified age, extraversion, mileage, penalty points and accidents all to be significant predictors of engagement with unnecessary distractions. The data presents a picture of widespread awareness of, and engagement with, distracting behaviours by drivers in the United Kingdom. Findings from the hierarchical regressions suggest scope may exist to mediate the levels of distracting behaviours by exploring individual differences and driving styles.

AB  - Mobile devices (e.g., smartphones, personal digital assistants, and tablets) are evolving rapidly and growing exponentially in multiple facets around the globe. Specifically, mobile devices can be used as audio and video chat, reference guide, training tool, handoff facilitation, and decision support. Undoubtedly, there are clear advantages of leveraging this technology including automatic updates, portable and unobtrusive access to data, and time savings for documentation allowing clinicians more time for patient care. However, innovative technology brings new yet critical obstacles to overcome (e.g., usability and security). Thus, the current panel is designed to gather leading human factors and medical experts in the fields of clinical care, system design, and human-system interaction to provide their insight and perspective on the following question: What contributions can human factors science and medical experts combine to bring to bear on the development, implementation, and evaluation of mobile-based technology?

AB  - Extension agents are finding themselves engaged in problem-solving roles as public needs adjust to a climate where issues facing the agricultural and natural resource industry are more often contentious than benign. As connectors between the Land-grant university system and the public, Extension agents need to know how to effectively communicate about contentious issues with clientele. This study used an online survey design to determine Extension agents' attitudes toward contentious issues, challenges that they face,and effective means of communication. The findings revealed Extension agents' attitudes toward communicating about contentious issues were more positive than negative. Additionally, they found the availability of misinformation and the complexity of contentious issues to be most challenging when communicating with clientele. One-on-one in-person, workshops, phone calls, and group meetings were identified as the most effective methods of communicating about contentious issues. Additional training and familiarization with current contentious issues were recommended. Future research should examine the contentious issues Extension agents are discussing, methods being used to facilitate conversations, the effect of contentious issues on job satisfaction, and the factors hindering Extension agents as they address contentious issues.

AB  - This study aimed to explore what factors influence mobile media users' adoption of new services and whether the adoption models differ depending on users' motives to use mobile media. The decomposed Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) and uses and gratifications theory were used as theoretical frameworks. Methodologically, an online survey was conducted with 400 Korean mobile users and structural equation modelling was employed. As a result, the proposed model explained well users' adoption intention for new mobile services. Especially, high- and low-motive groups showed significant differences in terms of the influence of subjective norms and Perceived Behavioural Control (PBC). [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The current study examines cyberbullying and victimization among African American college students who spend large amounts of time on the Internet and using their smartphones. In a survey of 321 African American college students, the most common venues for victimization occurred through text messages, phone calls, and social networking sites. Posting indiscreet images and sharing personal information with a large number of Facebook friends were positively associated with the victimization. Cyberbullying perpetration, as measured by Cyberbullying Questionnaire (CBQ), revealed a significant gender difference, with male students exhibiting higher prevalence. In a multiple regression analysis, the phenomenon of online disinhibition?a lessening of inhibitions during online interactions that would otherwise be present in face-to-face interactions?emerged as the strongest predictor of cyberbullying perpetration. Recommendations for future research include studying the negative impact of cyberbullying among African American adults, particularly in the workplace.

AB  - Highway construction occasionally takes place in remote locations, making its document management challenging especially when frequent document revisions occur. With the recent advancement of smartphones and tablets, Quick Response (QR) codes can provide project teams rapid and reliable access to up-to-date documents required for field operations. As a result, the use of QR codes can lead to a reduced need for traveling or meeting for document revisions, and reduce the amount of hardcopy documents and storage space. Despite the potential for significant benefits, there have been few studies aimed at assessing the feasibility of using QR codes in highway construction. In response, the objective of the study was to investigate the benefits of and barriers to using QR codes in highway construction for document management. To conduct the study, first a multi-step process was used, involving an online survey and interviews, with a goal of determining the status quo of highway construction in terms of document management and mobile information technology (IT). The results indicate that hardcopy documentation is still the most prevalent form of document management in highway construction, and hence there is an opportunity for implementing QR codes in conjunction with mobile IT. In the second part of the study, a time study using a real-world infrastructure project was conducted based on three activities: detail look up, specification check, and version check. As a result, the study found statistical evidence that using QR codes can lead to significant time savings.

AB  - Abstract: This study examines what factors lead to the adoption of the mobile e-book in South Korea. For this purpose, this research integrated the diffusion of innovation theory and technology acceptance model with the model of innovation resistance and applied this integrated model to the context of mobile e-book adoption. An online survey was administrated, and the data collected were analyzed with the structural equation model (SEM). Research results showed that individual innovativeness has a significant influence on perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. It also revealed that both of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use affect not only intention to use but also the innovation resistance. The innovation resistance has significant negative influence on the intention to use. Perceived risk of mobile e-books increases innovation resistance in a positive way. The implications of these results are discussed. [Copyright &y& Elsevier]

AB  - We examined the relationships between the determinants that affect customers’ use of food delivery apps. Using an extended technology acceptance model, we explored consumers’ experiences in purchasing delivery food through mobile apps. We distributed a self-administered questionnaire online and used structural equation modeling to test the hypotheses. We found that user-generated information, firm-generated information, and system quality had a significant effect on perceived usefulness. In addition, system quality and design quality strongly influenced the perceived ease of use, which improved perceived usefulness, and in turn, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use affected attitude toward the use of mobile apps. Practical implications for the food service industry are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study highlights differences in how mobile, portable, and fixed forms of information and communication technology (ICT) use support bonding and bridging forms of social capital. Results from a two-wave longitudinal panel survey revealed that dominant patterns of use were: 1) personal for mobile phones; 2) political for desktop PC; 3) personal as well as political uses for laptop, while tablet did not show any manifest usage patterns. Follow-up analysis linked specific uses of each medium to the distinct forms of social capital. We found that mobile phone use for personal relationships and coordinating activities contributed to bonding capital, while desktop PC use for political communication and information exchange supported bridging capital. Uses of laptop computers and tablets had no effect on any of social capital in this study.

AB  - Introduction: In line with the European Union’s Tobacco Products Directive (TPD), new regulations for electronic cigarettes implemented in the United Kingdom between May 2016 and May 2017 included limiting refills to 10 mL, tank and cartridge sizes to 2 mL, and nicotine concentrations to 20 mg/mL. Aims: To investigate the (1) awareness of new regulations, (2) product use before and after implementation, and (3) association between use of compliant products and subsequent smoking. Methods: A UK online longitudinal survey of smokers, ex-smokers, and vapers was conducted between May and June 2016 (wave 4) and September 2017 (wave 5).The following methods were used: (1) to assess awareness of changes, proportions were calculated by smoking and vaping status (n = 1606). (2) Comparison of refill volume, tank and cartridge volumes, nicotine concentration at waves 4 and 5 (n = 199–388) was conducted. (3) Association was studied between number of TPD-compliant products used at wave 4 and smoking at wave 5, adjusted for wave 4 vaping status, age, gender, income, urges to smoke, and device type (n = 480). Results: Awareness of regulations was highest for refill volume (10.1%; 37.4% among exclusive vapers) and nicotine concentration (9.5%; 27.3%). Higher proportions used TPD-compliant refill volumes (60.0%–73.7%, χ²(1) = 10.9, p = .001) and nicotine concentrations (89.2%–93.9%, χ²(1) = 7.41, p = .007) in wave 5 than wave 4, with little change for tank or cartridge volumes (77.1–75.5%, χ²(1) = 0.38, p = .540). The likelihood of smoking was similar for those using no or one TPD-compliant products as it was for those using two (OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 0.47–2.59) or three (OR = 1.56, 95% CI = 0.69–3.55). Conclusion: Several months after full implementation, awareness of new regulations was low and most vapers used TPD-compliant products. Use of compliant products was not associated with subsequent smoking. Implications: Using a longitudinal survey at the beginning and a few months after the end of the transition period for implementation of new regulation on electronic cigarettes, this is the first study to assess awareness of regulation and use of compliant products. After full implementation, awareness of changes was low overall (smokers, ex-smokers, and vapers combined) although higher among those who vaped. Nevertheless, most vapers (74%–94%) used products that were compliant with the new regulations and the use of products compliant with incoming regulations did not predict whether they were smoking cigarettes after implementation.

AB  - With the increase in video consumption on mobile devices, Korean broadcasters have begun to provide short video clips of re-edited existing broadcast content. This study aims to investigate the motivations that drive Korean consumers to watch short clips online and understand the behaviour of consumers to analyse video clips' additional promotional effects. Exploratory factor analysis and hierarchical regression were performed with online survey data. Findings suggest that selective entertainment is the most important factor affecting video clip consumption, intent to watch live programming on TV, and intent to purchase VOD. Additionally, video clip use motives have a strong influence on the intent to watch live programming on TV and purchase VOD. Therefore, broadcasters may consider consumers' psychological needs when providing video clip content. Because no academic study has attempted to investigate the relation between video clips usage and use patterns, this findings will be helpful for future research.

AB  - With the exponential growth of Internet technology, the notion of users' cognition when navigating such a vast information space has gained prominence. Studies suggest that metaphors can serve as effective tools to scaffold users' mental modeling processes. However, how users conceive of the metaphorical aid (as opposed to simply how they perceive it) remains questionable. Cognitive style, or the user's preferred way of information processing, has thus been posited as a possible factor affecting the success of the metaphorical approach in a hypermedia environment. This study explores the effects of visual metaphors and cognitive styles on users' learning performances in terms of structural knowledge and feelings of disorientation. The results indicate that a visual metaphor could improve the quality of mental formation, yet simultaneously increase users' mental load during navigation. In addition, cognitive style is a crucial factor that can significantly affect users' learning performance. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although Virtual reality (VR) entertainment is now relatively popular, the adoption of VR devices is still low. In this study, a framework based benefit and sacrifice factors was developed to understand players' intention to use VR devices to play games. Online questionnaire items were developed and published to collect the responses from university students in Taiwan. The feedback of 152 inexperienced players and 150 experienced players were collected. The eleven hypotheses were tested by using SmartPLS, a structural equation modeling (SEM) tool. The analysis results show that the influences of the benefit factors (flow, spatial presence, and relaxation) on the adoption intention in two groups are consistent. All of the positive influences are supported. Moreover, visual fatigue had the strongest negative effects on flow and intention. Players who are opener to new technology are more possible to adopt VR devices. The findings can provide insights to VR device developers to design their VR devices/contents and marketing strategies.

AB  - Although digital media are widely recognized as a predictor of protest participation and a platform for the coordination of connective actions, few studies have examined how digital media activities systematically relate to protesters’ mode of participation in protest campaigns. This study aims at filling the research gap through analyzing the Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong. It identifies time spent in the occupied areas, participation leadership, and forms of actions undertaken as three aspects of a protester's mode of participation that can indicate a protester's degree of involvement in the movement. Analysis of a protester onsite survey shows that the protesters were active in four types of digital media activities: online expression, online debates, online explanatory activities, and mobile communication. Digital media activities are generally positively related to degree of involvement, but the four types of activities are also related to the three aspects of mode of participation differently. The findings illustrate how digital media activities are integrated into individualized mode of participation in contemporary connective actions. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

AB  - This study investigated the effects of implementing an online instant response system "Kahoot!" in an Earth Science class in a rural area of Taiwan. The study adopted the mixed-methods approach, based primarily on a quasi-experimental approach, to investigate the effects. The participants were randomly grouped into two classes, with Kahoot! as the intervention. The seventh-grade junior high school students were instructed by the same teacher. The research questions were whether the mobile technology impacted students' learning motivation and achievement and how the learning processes proceeded. Data were collected through surveys, student assignments, exams, learning journals, and interviews. The results indicated that the implementation of "Kahoot!" can enhance these rural-area students' learning motivation, gain the rural-area students' attention, and create incentives for the students to preview and review learning materials promoting learning efficiency. Moreover, the integration enhanced learning achievement. On the other hand, the teachable moments Kahoot! created may not be sustainable. It is hoped that the research findings can provide teachers with implications and guidelines to successfully integrate mobile technologies to enhance learning in their classrooms.

AB  - Positive face-to-face human interactions are known to benefit well-being. Drawing upon previous work regarding the interference of media (via technological devices or print) in social interaction, the aim of this study was to identify whether using media during face-to-face interaction could potentially limit the positive effect of interaction on well-being. Participants were 437 university students who completed an online survey which assessed media multitasking behaviors, well-being (trait depression, trait anxiety, social anxiety, empathy, and psychological well-being), and personality traits (Big-5 and narcissism). Face-to-face interaction was positively associated with well-being. However, when media use during face-to-face interaction was considered, there was a negative relationship with well-being (more depression, more anxiety, and less psychological well-being). Those who used certain media types, such as phone or video chatting, listening to music, and gaming, while interacting with others, also had lower scores on measures of empathy. Regression analyses showed significant contributions by these media types to empathy levels, even after controlling for age, gender, and personality traits. Face-to-face media multitasking was related to higher levels of narcissism and neuroticism, and lower levels of agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness. This study provides insight into the possible role of media multitasking during face-to-face interaction on psychosocial outcomes.

AB  - Smartphones have become very popular globally, and smartphone ownership has overtaken conventional cell phone ownership in many countries in recent years. With this rapid rise in smartphone penetration, researchers are looking at ways to conduct web surveys using smartphones. This is particularly true of student populations where smartphone penetration is very high and web surveys are already the norm. However, researchers are raising concerns about selection biases and measurement differences between PC and smartphone respondents. Questions also remain about comparisons to traditional interviewer-administered approaches. We designed an experimental comparison between a PC web survey, a smartphone web survey and a computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) survey. This study was conducted using an annual survey of students at a large university in South Korea. The CATI (interviewer-administered) survey had a higher response rate, lower margins of error, and better representation of the student population than the two web (self-administered) modes, but at a higher cost. The CATI survey also had lower rates of item nonresponse. More significant differences were found between the modes for sensitive questions than for nonsensitive ones. This suggests that CATI surveys may still have a role to play in surveys of college students, even in a country with high rates of mobile technology adoption.

AB  - Purpose - With the rapid surge of mobile marketing, an increasing number of brands have launched branded emoticons in an attempt to build brand relationships with consumers. Despite the apparent promise of branded emoticon usage, there is only limited academic research on branded emoticons. This paper aims to build on impression management theory and the conceptualization of cuteness to investigate how the effect of cuteness in branded emoticon design influences perceived playfulness in mobile instant messaging (MIM) interaction and the creation of brand engagement in self-concept.
Design/methodology/approach - Consumers with usage experience of branded emoticons in MIM apps were recruited to complete an online survey. Partial least squares structural equation modelling was used to analyze the data.
Findings - Two facets of cuteness - kindchenschema cuteness and whimsical cuteness - can project a favourable social image to consumers that facilitates playfulness in social interaction and enhances brand engagement in self-concept, which leads to their willingness to purchase the brand and stickiness to the MIM apps.
Originality/value - The popularity of branded emoticons represents a new form of social interaction and an innovative way to build brand relationships. The present study is the first to examine the design aspects of branded emoticons and highlights that the cuteness of a branded emoticon may be a crucial factor in engaging consumers in MIM.

AB  - This study examined the effects of online activity and alcohol use on Internet delinquency using data sets from the Korea Youth Panel Survey and focusing on adolescents in their 10th grade in high school (Wave 3). The current study investigated differences in Internet delinquency at Level 1 and Level 2. The units of Level 1 were students and those of Level 2 were schools. The total sample size for this study was 2,854 students at Level 1 and 166 schools at Level 2. Given the hierarchical nature of this data set, this study used hierarchical generalized linear modeling to determine that those youth who drank, used computer games, and used mobile phones were more likely to engage in Internet delinquency compared to nondrinkers, non-computer users, and non-mobile phone users.

AB  - This study examines mobile divide by gender, age, social economic status (SES), and social capital using a conceptual model of mobile divide. This model is composed of eight components of mobile divide which are divided into the following three groups: two antecedents of mobile use including innovativeness and competence, two types of actual mobile use (talk and non-talk), and consequences of mobile use including life management, resource use, network management, and personal identity display. Through a survey of 400 mobile users in Korea, our study verified the validity of the proposed model. In addition, this model enables us to examine mobile divide in two different approaches - at the level of each component and in the relations among the components. Mobile divides by gender, age, SES, and social capital existed at the level of various components. Age and SES even showed significant mobile divides in the relations between mobile uses and consequence-related components. Implications of the results in our study along with the two types of approaches to mobile divide are discussed.

AB  - We study how digital service firms can develop an active customer base, focusing on two questions. First, how does the way that customers use the service postadoption to meet their own needs (personal usage) and to interact with one another (social usage) vary across customer acquisition methods? Second, how do firm-to-customer and customer-to-customer communications promote different types of usage? We study these questions using two data sets and by developing a multivariate hierarchical Poisson hidden Markov model (HMM), which fits the data significantly better than univariate and latent class approaches. We indeed find that postadoption behavior varies depending on customer acquisition method and dynamic states. At the total usage level, in one context (an annotation and note-taking service), customers who heard about the service through search and mass-invite exhibited significantly higher usage compared to those who joined through word of mouth (WOM), whereas in another context (a cloud-based file storage service), customers who joined through WOM referrals tended to exhibit higher usage. Yet, examining how routes of adoption relate to specific types of behavior, personal versus social usages, reveals a more nuanced picture. Furthermore, in both contexts, communications postadoption influenced engagement, albeit in different ways. Firm-to-customer communications, through company posts to Twitter and blog entries, had varying effects on customer behavior and in some cases led to lower personal and/or social usage; however, customer-to-customer communications tended to increase personal-use engagement across latent states and in both data sets. The findings suggest that firms offering digital services should pay attention to how the mode of customer acquisition is related to subsequent usage intensity, accounting for both personal and social activity, and encourage customers to interact with each other postadoption.

AB  - Psychological factors and social relationships are important components that influence an individual's communication style. This paper aims to examine the association of personality factors, social anxiety (SA) and loneliness with mobile phone (MP) usage preferences on the basis of voice calling and text messaging. Malaysian MP users (N = 187) completed four questionnaires (Mobile Phone Usage Questionnaire, Big Five Inventory, Interaction Anxiousness Scale and UCLA Loneliness Scale) on paper or online via a web-link. Multiple regression analyses revealed that personality, SA and loneliness broadly predicted preferences for voice calling or text messaging. Further analyses examining the predictability of time spent on voice calls/text messaging and number of people called/exchanged text messages also revealed some significant findings in regards to the openness-to-experience personality dimension, loneliness and SA. The findings of this research have important implications to tailoring the delivery of psychological services to individuals diagnosed with chronic loneliness and SA.

AB  - Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) programs permit employees to use personal devices to access organizational information. Users gain convenience, while employers benefit from increased productivity and reduced IT expense. Security boundaries must extend to personal devices to mitigate data exfiltration, thereby infringing on employees' privacy by monitoring their personal devices. These monitoring mechanisms play a critical role in employee participation in a BYOD program. Our results demonstrate that the BYOD monitoring mechanisms and privacy concerns suppress the benefits of increased job performance expectancy when evaluating whether to participate in a BYOD program. This research identifies that tasks measured, frequency of monitoring, and organizational control are significant impediments to behavioral intention for BYOD participation.

AB  - This study analyses the effects of perceived relevance and perceived vulnerability on approach and avoidance intentions toward location-based mobile marketing (LBMM) and investigates the moderating effect of privacy self-efficacy (PSE). For this, the study considers two types of consumers' approach intentions and two types of their avoidance intentions to provide a better understanding of LBMM adoption. The results of an online survey of 1864 mobile phone users in the USA indicate that perceived relevance had positive effects of both types of consumers' approach intentions but negative effects only on their willingness to refuse. In addition, perceived vulnerability had positive effects on both types of consumers' avoidance intentions as well as their willingness to pretest. PSE had significant moderating effects on the relationships between perceived relevance/perceived vulnerability and approach/avoidance intentions. These results have important theoretical and practical implications. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The main purpose of this study is to investigate the factors influencing the adoption of cloud services. Prior research on the Diffusion Theory usually focuses on innovation attributes and lacks psychological dynamics. This study integrates both the innovation mechanism and psychological mechanism. Gender differences are examined. The survey results discover that relative advantage and observability are important antecedents of cloud services adoption. New technology self-efficacy is also an important predictor of cloud services adoption. The theoretical contribution of this model is its provision of a detailed account of the key forces from the perspective of innovation mechanism and psychological mechanisms underpinning the assessment of adoption intention. It also advances our knowledge that men and women react differently in making cloud usage decisions. Results of the current study indicate that both genders put the emphasis on the utilitarian aspects of cloud services. This study also provides useful suggestions for policy makers and cloud services providers in formulating strategies to enhance cloud services popularity.

AB  - Information communication technology contains both a positive and negative side. This study investigates the negative side such as induced stress and its impacts on the productivity and quality of life of business workers. This study contributes to this area of research by focusing on social interactions and personal life after work hours in understanding the phenomenon of technostress. This study examines how social interaction stressors and personal life stressors are related to use of mobile instant messenger after work hours. The related strain is regarded as having a negative influence on productivity and quality of life. A model was proposed and tested using a web-based and offline (face-to-face) survey was employed. Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation model analysis were implemented in AMOS 18.0. The study found that social insecurity, invasion of life, and work-home conflict had a positive relation with perceived strain, which in turn had a negative effect on life satisfaction. On the other hand, perceived strain positively affected productivity. Conclusively, this study developed a model for technostress from mobile communication and empirically tested the validity of the proposed model.

AB  - This study aimed to explore what factors influence mobile media users' adoption of new services and whether the adoption models differ depending on users' motives to use mobile media. The decomposed Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) and uses and gratifications theory were used as theoretical frameworks. Methodologically, an online survey was conducted with 400 Korean mobile users and structural equation modelling was employed. As a result, the proposed model explained well users' adoption intention for new mobile services. Especially, high- and low-motive groups showed significant differences in terms of the influence of subjective norms and Perceived Behavioural Control (PBC).

AB  - This study investigates factor that affect usage changes in mobile data services (MDS). First, we conducted an exploratory study based on 378 survey responses to learn about important decision factors of MDS usage. It revealed a discrepancy between the forces influencing usage increase and those of usage decrease. Based on the findings from the exploratory study and Hertzberg's two-factor theory, we postulated information quality as the motivator and system quality as the de-motivator of MDS usage. Then, we undertook a confirmative study on the respective roles of these factors in encouraging and discouraging the usage of MDS. We proposed a research model and empirically tested our hypotheses with partial least square (PLS) analysis based on 478 responses from MDS users. Information quality (as a motivator) was positively associated with MDS usage increase, but system quality (as a de-motivator) was not. Also, system quality was negatively associated with usage decrease, but information quality was not. Last, their association was partially moderated by the type of motivation for using MDS. Information quality had a storonger influences on MDS usage increase when the main motive was utilitarian rather than hedonic.

AB  - Seit Anfang der 2000er Jahre hat die rasante Verbreitung von Kameras durch Mobiltelefone, Überwachungskameras und Body Cameras zu einem starken Anstieg von Videoaufnahmen menschlicher Interaktionen geführt. Über Webseiten, die auf Nutzer*innen-generierten Inhalten aufbauen (z.B. YouTube) sowie Live-Streaming-Seiten (z.B. GeoCam) wird der Zugang zu solchem Videomaterial enorm erleichtert und ist heute für Forschende nur einen Mausklick entfernt. Während die Nutzung dieser Datenbestände großes Potenzial für die sozialwissenschaftliche Forschung verspricht, wirft sie auch forschungsethische Fragen auf, die existierende Richtlinien und Veröffentlichungen bislang nur teilweise beantworten können. In unserem Artikel beziehen wir bestehende forschungsethische Prinzipien und Überlegungen auf die Forschung mit Online-Videodaten. Wir diskutieren fünf Bereiche, die für die Nutzung von Online-Videodaten aus forschungsethischer Sicht besonders relevant sind bzw. in denen solche Forschung besondere Potenziale verspricht: die informierte Einwilligung, Analysemöglichkeiten, Privatsphäre, Transparenz und die Vermeidung von Schaden. Wir zeigen auf, wie diese Bereiche zusammenhängen und wie Forschende sowie Leser*innen von Studien mit Online-Videodaten diese in forschungsethischer Hinsicht bewerten können. Wir hoffen, mit diesem Artikel zu einer informierten und transparenteren Diskussion zum Thema Forschungsethik im Bereich der Forschung mit Online-Videodaten beitragen zu können.Alternate abstract:Since the early 2000s, the proliferation of cameras in devices such as mobile phones, closed-circuit television (CCTV), or body cameras has led to a sharp increase in video recordings of human interaction and behavior. Through websites that employ user-generated content (e.g., YouTube) and live streaming sites (e.g., GeoCam), access to such videos virtually is at the fingertips of social science researchers. Online video data offer great potential for social science research to study an array of human interaction and behavior, but they also raise ethical questions to which existing guidelines and publications only provide partial answers. In our article we address this gap, drawing on existing ethical discussions and applying them to the use of online video data. We examine five areas in which online video research raises specific questions or promises unique potentials: informed consent, analytic opportunities, privacy, transparency, and minimizing harm to participants. We discuss their interplay and how these areas can inform practitioners, reviewers, and interested readers of online video studies when evaluating the ethical standing of a study. With this study, we contribute to an informed and transparent discussion about ethics in online video research.

AB  - The study of mundane, everyday uses of the Internet remains an emerging field of inquiry. Analysing data from a large seven country survey of Internet use and adapting concepts and methods developed by Bourdieu, we show that there are distinct clusters of users who use the Internet in diverse ways to solve everyday problems, such as buying a mobile phone or diagnosing an illness. Such everyday problem-solving is dependent upon degrees of economic, social, digital and cultural capital, and varies across countries. A comparative methodological strategy combined the use of multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), and for the first time in the field, multiple factor analysis for contingency tables (MFACTs). Extending the work of Bourdieu and the sociology of class more generally, we argue that digital capital functions as a bridging capital aiding the convertibility of other forms of capital to the benefit of already advantaged groups.

AB  - This chapter is, in many respects, an attempt to codify a series of questions that 1:1 schools have had to answer, whether they did so deliberately or on the fly. It is meant to prepare you for the many issues that you will face on the way to a successful 1:1 program. What it does not do is speak to the influential, authentic change you will see if your school does this well. When combined with a powerful change in pedagogical practice, a 1:1 computing program can help students and teachers create a learning environment that is truly transformative for all involved. The potential to create new ideas and solve problems when a digital device is in the hands of your students—along with access to the open-ended, accessible tools of Web 2.0—can move schools from enclosed institutions surrounded by four walls to organizations at the forefront of deep and expansive learning.

AB  - The experience sampling method (ESM) is a structured diary method with high ecological validity, in that it accurately captures the everyday context of individuals through repeated measurements in naturalistic environments. Our main objective was to investigate the feasibility of using ESM in individuals with acquired brain injury (ABI). A second goal was to explore the usability of ESM data on a clinical level, by illustrating the interactions between person, environment, and affect. The PsyMate device provided ABI patients (N = 17) with ten signals (beeps) per day during six consecutive days. Each beep was followed by a digital questionnaire assessing mood, location, activities, social context, and physical well-being. Results demonstrated high feasibility with a 71% response rate and a 99% completion rate of the questionnaires. There were no dropouts and the method was experienced as user-friendly. Time-lagged multilevel analysis showed that higher levels of physical activity and fatigue predicted higher levels of negative affect at the same point in time, but not at later time points. This study illustrates the potential of ESM to identify complex person-environment dynamics after ABI, while generating understandable and easy to use graphical feedback.

AB  - In what conditions does a technical mediation allow subjects to meet and to recognize each other? In digital networks, virtual spaces of collaborative work and play give rise to interactions at a distance between users. But to what extent do these interactions allow each partner to recognize the living presence of other perceiving subjects? In order to study this question, we use perceptual supplementation devices (more commonly known as sensory substitution systems). These devices for prosthetic perception represent an extreme situation, which is highly revealing as to the way that technological devices transform our perceptual capacities. Here, they make it possible to identify the conditions for the existence of perceptual crossing, i.e. a situation which makes it possible for two subjects to recognize each other. To carry out this research, we propose a minimalist experimental paradigm, constructed with the aid of the `Tactos' system. This perceptual supplementation device has been developed in order to give a tactile perception of digital forms present on the screen of a computer. When two such devices are connected in a network, they also allow tactile interactions between users at a distance (one can speak of distal caresses). The minimal version of this device gives scope for an experimental study and a precise analysis of the perceptual interactions. These experiments lead us to suggest several conditions which seem necessary for the constitution of a lived experience of perceptual crossing: the presence for each partner of a body-image perceivable by the other participants; a direct link between the perceptual activity and the dynamics of this body-image; and the impossibility for each partner to themselves perceive the body-image they present to the other participants.

AB  - Background There is growing interest in the use of technology to enhance the tracking and quality of clinical information available for patients in disaster settings. This paper describes the design and evaluation of the Wireless Internet Information System for Medical Response in Disasters (WIISARD). Materials and methods WIISARD combined advanced networking technology with electronic triage tags that reported victims' position and recorded medical information, with wireless pulse-oximeters that monitored patient vital signs, and a wireless electronic medical record (EMR) for disaster care. The EMR system included WiFi handheld devices with barcode scanners (used by front-line responders) and computer tablets with role-tailored software (used by managers of the triage, treatment, transport and medical communications teams). An additional software system provided situational awareness for the incident commander. The WIISARD system was evaluated in a large-scale simulation exercise designed for training first responders. A randomized trial was overlaid on this exercise with 100 simulated victims, 50 in a control pathway (paper-based), and 50 in completely electronic WIISARD pathway. All patients in the electronic pathway were cared for within the WIISARD system without paperbased workarounds. Results WIISARD reduced the rate of the missing and/or duplicated patient identifiers (0% vs 47%, p<0.001). The total time of the field was nearly identical (38:20 vs 38:23, IQR 26:53-1:05:32 vs 18:55-57:22). Conclusion Overall, the results of WIISARD show that wireless EMR systems for care of the victims of disasters would be complex to develop but potentially feasible to build and deploy, and likely to improve the quality of information available for the delivery of care during disasters.

AB  - The Internet is a rich multimodal communication environment where researchers can often recruit large numbers of participants for survey studies at low cost; however, there are many unanswered questions about the use of this technology in medical research. An important question is whether the results obtained in such surveys are generalizable to other populations. In this article, we describe different approaches for recruitment of participants on the Internet and how specific approaches may limit generalizability. Another issue clouding use of the Web in research is the essential anonymity of participants. We discuss the risk and benefits of anonymous surveys and technical methods that minimize the risks while preserving anonymity and confidentiality. A related problem may be accidental or deliberate enrollment of unqualified individuals in studies. Researchers can use survey design and statistical methods described herein to partially address threats to validity arising from such individuals; however, in some situations, confirmation of eligibility, by manual review of medical records, may be necessary.

AB  - Pedestrian crashes are an important issue globally as pedestrians are a highly vulnerable road user group, accounting for approximately 35% of road deaths worldwide each year. In highly motorised countries, pedestrian distraction by hand held technological devices appears to be an increasing factor in such crashes. An online survey (N = 363) was conducted to 1) obtain prevalence information regarding the extent to which people cross the road while simultaneously using mobile phones for potentially distracting activities; 2) identify whether younger adult pedestrians are more exposed to/at risk of injury due to this cause than older adults; and 3) explore whether the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) might provide insight into the factors influencing the target behaviours. Self-reported frequency of using a smart phone for three levels of distraction (visual and cognitive-texting/internet; cognitive only- voice calls; audio only-listening to music) while crossing the road was collected. Results indicated that about 20% of the sample had high exposure to smart phone use while crossing, especially 18-30 year olds who were significantly more likely than other age groups to report frequent exposure. TPB constructs of Attitude, Subjective Norm, and Perceived Behavioural Control significantly predicted intentions to use a smart phone while crossing the road, accounting for 62% of variance in Intentions for the entire sample, and 54% of the variance for 18-30 year olds. Additional variables of Mobile Phone Involvement and Group Norms provided an additional significant 6% of the variance explained for both groups. Attitude was by far the strongest predictor for both the whole sample and for 18-30 year olds, accounting for 38% and 41% explained variance, respectively. This suggests that pedestrians with positive attitudes towards using their smart phones while crossing the road have stronger intentions to do so. Moreover, high exposure was associated with stronger intentions to use a smart phone while crossing, and the effect was large, suggesting high frequency mobile phone use may lead to riskier habits, such as failing to interrupt use while crossing the road. Interventions should target pedestrians under 30 years old and aim to strengthen negative attitudes towards using smart phones while crossing, or to challenge the perceived advantages or emphasise the disadvantages of using one's phone while crossing in order to reduce intentions to do so. Young people's perceptions that others in their social group approve of smart phone use while crossing could also be an important factor to address. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Previous research shows that the direction of rating scales can influence participants? response behavior. Studies also suggest that the device used to complete online surveys might affect the susceptibility to these effects due to the different question layouts (e.g., horizontal grids vs. vertical individual questions). This article contributes to previous research by examining scale direction effects in an online multi-device survey conducted with panelists in Spain. In this experiment, respondents were randomly assigned to two groups where the scale direction was manipulated (incremental vs. decremental). Respondents completed the questionnaire using the device of their choosing (57.8% used PCs; 36.5% used smartphones; and 5.7% used tablets). The results show that scale direction influenced response distributions but did not significantly affect data quality. In addition, our findings indicate that scale direction effects were comparable across devices. Findings are discussed and implications are highlighted.

AB  - This paper examines what influences trust in mobile social commerce environment. Drawing on trust-based acceptance model (i.e. cognitive and emotional trust) and online review features (i.e. profile photo, linguistic style, and reported experience), we examine how these factors affect trust in mobile social commerce. Hypotheses were tested using survey data. The results of our model showed that there are significant influences of profile photo, reported experience, cognitive, and emotional trust towards trust in ms-commerce. This work contributes to existing literature by examining the roles of previous trust in mobile payments and online reviews on trust in mobile social commerce.

AB  - Objective: Audio is increasingly used to access information on the Internet through virtual assistants and smart speakers. Our objective is to evaluate the distribution of health information through audio. Materials and Methods: We conducted 2 studies to compare comprehension after reading or listening to information using a new corpus containing short text snippets from Cochrane (N=50) and Wikipedia (N=50). In study 1, the snippets were first presented as audio or text followed by a multiple-choice question. Then, the same information was presented as text and the question was repeated in addition to questions about perceived difficulty, severity and the likelihood of encountering the disease. In study 2, the first multiple-choice question was replaced with a free recall question. Results: Study 1 showed that information comprehension is very similar in both presentation modes (53% accuracy for text and 55% for audio). Study 2 showed that information retention is higher with text, but similar comprehension. Both studies show improvement in performance with repeated information presentation. Discussion: Audio presentation of information is effective and the format novel. Performance was slightly lower with audio when asked to repeat information, but comparable to text for answering questions. Additional studies are needed with different types of information and presentation combinations. Conclusion: The use of audio to provide health information is a promising field and will become increasingly important with the popularity of smart speakers and virtual assistants, particularly for consumers who do not use computers, for example minority groups, or those with limited sight or motor control.

AB  - The goal of this study is to investigate how flow experience and diverse smartphone activities play a role in influencing people's perceived boredom during free time. Through a telephone survey, data were gathered from a probability sample of 653 smartphone users. Results indicate that the more people who engage in pleasure-seeking, short-lived, and diversionary hedonic activities, the stronger the feeling that their physical involvement is lacking. Eudaemonic activities, such as information seeking, significantly predicted a lack of meaningful involvement, while utilities significantly predicted a perceived slowness of time and lack of mental involvement. Findings also revealed that people achieve flow state when they use a smartphone for entertainment, information seeking, and sociability, especially when they feel bored, sense a lack of meaningful involvement, and want their free time to last. Furthermore, the interaction effects found in the study provide a more nuanced view about the ways in which eudaemonic smartphone activities (especially for information seeking and sociability) can interact with flow experience to regulate perceived boredom in free time. This study suggests that app designers should recognize the role of newly developed hedonic and eudaemonic functions of the smartphone which may significantly alleviate perceived boredom in free time.

AB  - This article presents an explorative qualitative case study of how sixteen young Somali migrants stranded in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia feel about staying in touch with loved ones abroad using Internet-based transnational communication. Left-behind during transit migration from Somalia to overseas, at this moment they can only digitally connect with contacts living inside for example dreamed diasporic locations in Europe. Based on in-depth interviews, a focus group and concept maps drawn by informants the ambivalent workings of affects spurred by transnational communication are explored. The intense feelings of togetherness originating in Skype video-chat, mobile phone calls and Facebook use are conceptualized with the notion of transnational affective capital - one of the only sources of capital the informants have. The ambivalence of transnational affective capital is scrutinized by exploring whether such connectivity routines offer trust, enable anxiety management and promote 'ontological security'. Alternatively, the question arises whether transnational communication may further exacerbate ontological insecurity: discomfort, unsettlement and increased anxiety related to the precarious situation of being stranded.

The authors would like to amend two incorrect attributions. The first attribution to be corrected is in the first sentence after the heading ‘2 Language dictionaries: Perspectives on use and design’. The second attribution to be corrected is in the second sentence of the sixth paragraph following the heading ‘2.2 Functionality’, which reads 'In a large-scale survey on dictionary use, Granger (2012b: 445, 448) found that...' The corrections to these attributions, as well as a correction to the end reference, are provided in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2015-15050-001[/rid].) Abstract This paper investigates the extent of electronic dictionary use by language learners in an Australian university. All students in the study are formally enrolled in language courses across ten languages at first, second or third year level. The study places a particular emphasis on gauging student perceptions of the beneficial aspects of electronic dictionaries as judged by learners themselves in circumstances where they are able to act independently. As these benefits are often described in terms of usability and functionality, these particular terms are defined and introduced in the literature review, and then later they are employed to help structure and describe the results. The arguments for the discussion are supported by the use of empirical data taken from a large-scale survey conducted in 2011 (n=587) where comments from students were obtained on why and how dictionary-type resources were accessed and used (see also Steel & Levy, 2013). The paper restricts itself to the quantitative and qualitative data gathered on mobile phones, translators, dictionaries and web conjugators and related items (e.g. discussion forums). The particular functions that students use and the ways in which they use them are described and categorised, with the discussion supported by student comments. The data exhibits a remarkable range of resources available to students to look up unknown words or to see translations and, consequently, our understanding of what exactly an electronic dictionary might comprise is challenged. Many students’ comments demonstrate a sophistication and knowledge about the effective use of these dictionary tools together with a keen awareness of their limitations.

AB  - GIS elemental unit representations of spatial data are often defined in terms of points, lines and areas. However, another type of spatial data that is becoming frequently captured, but as yet is largely ignored in GIS, is that of video. While digital video recording is a commonly encountered medium in modern society and encompasses many forms, from simple personal camcorders through to sophisticated survey and surveillance systems, its geographical representation in a GIS has not been fully examined or realised. In the majority of cases the video footage is usually captured while the device and/or the objects being viewed are in motion. What is of particular interest is when video streams can be, or have been, associated with spatial data such as location and orientation to create geographically referenced videographic data, which, for simplicity, will be defined as spatial video. Fundamentally, the nature of video is to record space, so when spatial properties can be accurately acquired and associated with this footage, an important geographical element can be considered for integration and analysis within a GIS.
Existing spatial video systems, both commercial and research, are predominantly used in survey or LBS roles and are usually bespoke and application specific. These systems do not model spatial video to any recognised standards that is generalised to be both data and platform independent. They do not support GIS integration and/or analysis from a purely spatial content perspective. A video-image/remote-sensing centric approach prevails where usage options range from simple visualisation interfaces to interactive computer vision systems. What has been largely overlooked is a spatial approach where the inherent geographical extent recorded in each video frame can be modelled and used in a geo-spatial analysis context. While this modelling approach has not been fully realised, it does exist in a GIS form based on Open Geospatial Consortium standards, where the spatial context of video is defined in a structure called a ViewCone. However, a ViewCone only defines a 2D model of the geographical extent of each frame and is restricted to a three-or-five sided polygon representation.
Thus, this article examines the potential of modelling spatial video through the use of elemental data types within GIS; gives some examples of using this approach; describes some problems in using spatial video within GIS; and then demonstrates how these problems are being solved. This is done in three stages: Firstly, a detailed overview of spatial video in its current GIS role is provided - this is achieved through a complete introduction to the distinct elements of spatial video followed by a review of its use in both commercial and academic application areas. Secondly, a brief theoretical overview of an alternative GIS-constrained ViewCone data structure is given that defines a more flexible spatial video model for both 2D and 3D GIS analysis and visualisation. Thirdly, a selective sample of results is presented based on an implementation of this approach being applied to a constrained spatial video data source in a specific study area.

AB  - Using Rogers? diffusion of innovation model, this study examined the relationships between lifestyles and the adoption of six new technologies in Taiwan. Three of the six technologies?notebooks, netbooks, and tablet PCs?are information technologies, while the remaining three technologies?Wii, Kinect, and digital videos (DVs)?are entertainment technologies. A telephone survey was adopted to obtain a representative sample, which obtained 1157 valid calls with a response rate of 53.1%. Two conclusions are drawn from the data analysis. First, lifestyles did play a significant role in predicting the adoption of the six technologies. Second, this study found that demographics and mass media use were more predictive of the adoption of information technologies than that of the adoption of entertainment technologies.

AB  - The present research attempted to develop a multidimensional brand trust scale and provide an alternative measurement model of brand trust. The proposed measurement model was tested with a set of data collected through a large-scale survey conducted by a professional research firm in China using the Central Location Test approach. The respondents consisted of 1,343 Chinese consumers who had adequate experience with the products we investigated. To reduce possible sample biases, respondents were recruited in multiple cities in different regions of China, including Beijing in the north, Shanghai in the middle, Guanzhou in the south, and Chengdo, an inland city in Sichuan Province. Six products were chosen to be tested in this study: detergent, beer, digital camera, laptop computer, car and wireless phone services. We chose to test the model with multiple products in the hope that the multidimensional scale would be applicable across product categories. The products were selected based on a pretest involving 88 students at a business school in Beijing. The instrument used in the main study contains the 12 items measuring brand trust and its two dimensions. The results have important implications. Because brand trust can be measured at different levels, researchers must be cautious in selecting a particular scale to use in the future. As discussed above, it is important to be clear about the level of trust in which one is interested since failure to distinguish measurement levels may impair measurement accuracy and cause model misspecification. For instance, it is not unusual to find measurement scales in marketing literature that contain both measures of overall trust and measures tapping into specific dimensions. The practice of using items indicating specific dimensions as direct measures of the construct of higher abstraction may create a problem of lack of unidimensionality if the final scale in fact taps into multiple content domains. Alternatively, it may result in a unidimensional construct with a content domain so restrictive that they actually measure a construct that is not of general interest.

AB  - Whether mobile phones benefit or sabotage close relationships has been a persistent subject of debate in media and communication studies. Because previous studies have demonstrated contrasting findings, further studies on this topic are required. Based on media richness theory and social penetration theory, this study investigated the direct and indirect associations between mobile communication and relationship quality (i.e., depth, support, and conflict) in romantic relationships. A survey of 1,000 university students in China revealed that relationship depth was positively predicted by mobile phone calls and negatively predicted by mobile short messages. Mobile WeChat had dialectical effects, as it reinforced relationship depth and support, but increased conflict. Regarding indirect effects, communication quality online positively mediated the effects of mobile phone calls on relationship quality and negatively mediated the effects of mobile short messages and Weibo on relationship quality. Moreover, passionate love attitudes (PLAs) and gender negatively moderated the effects of mobile phone calls on relationship depth, indicating that females and individuals who had stronger PLAs had lower relationship quality when they used mobile phone calls to interact with their romantic partners. The moderating effects of PLA were extended to the indirect relationship between phone calls and relationship quality through communication quality. Overall, this study developed a typology to examine mobile relational communication by integrating the quantity (i.e., mobile use frequencies) and quality of mobile communication, as well as personal attitudes in close relationships.

AB  - How did residents in Wuhan, who were at the epicenter of the initial COVID-19 outbreaks in China evaluate the risk to themselves and to society at large, and take action accordingly? This study examines the need for orientation, cognitive reasoning of COVID-19 news, and perceived risk, which all contributed to protective action during the city's total lockdown. Using data collected in a mobile CATI survey during the peak of the outbreaks in February 2020, findings show that the attention to COVID-19 in digital media predicted the perception of the coronavirus pandemic as a personal risk. In addition, the need for orientation and elaboration of news about the outbreaks were positively associated with perceived risk target – personal and societal. Finally, perceived personal risk proved a stronger predictor than perceived risk to society in general for taking protective behavior. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Recent applications on mobile devices have increased the dependence of the user on visual feedback for effective interaction with the interface. When loading an application, a user may encounter a long wait time which is generally inevitable and is viewed as the primary negative emotion sources from the user interface. This study conducted a 2 × 3 mixed factorial design to explore whether different feedback types of wait indicators (i.e. bar and cartoon-bar designs) and feedback velocities (i.e. constant, accelerate, and decelerate progress speeds) may affect user's time perception and wait evaluations. Twenty-four young adults participated in this study. The experimental data were collected through a time estimation and a 7-point Likert scale. The generated results revealed that: (i) Participants' time estimation could be shortened when they encountered the 'decelerate' progress speed. (ii) Participants' time estimation and perceived speed might not always be consistent. (iii) The feedback type of 'cartoon-bar' might not significantly reduce participants' time perception. Nonetheless, the 'cartoon-bar' type significantly improve participants' wait evaluations. (iv) The feedback progress speeds positively correlated with wait evaluations by participants. RESEARCH Highlights: The visual feedback designs affect the user's time estimation and wait evaluations. The progress bar with lovely elements can improve user's wait experiences. The progress speed of 'decelerate' can reduce the user's time estimation. User's time estimation and perceived speed might not always be consistent. User's perceived speed positively correlated with their wait evaluations.

AB  - Diversification is routinely promoted to improve poor rural peoples' livelihoods. However, policy recommendations for livelihood diversification based on evidence from crop-cultivating sedentary rural societies may not work for mobile pastoral communities, where socio-ecological conditions predetermine livestock herding as the preferred livelihood strategy. Using survey and semi-structured interview data collected from 159 households in the Altay and Tianshan Mountains of Xinjiang, China, this study applies cluster analysis to identify six distinct groups based on livelihood strategies: pastoralists, agropastoralists, crop farmers, wage labourers, hired herders and mixed smallholders. Although pastoralism is the least diverse of these in terms of sources of income, it is significantly more diverse in ecological dimensions such as spatial movement, land use pattern and livestock portfolio. Patterns of livelihood diversification and their relationship with household incomes indicate that pastoralism, although preferred, is unattainable for 55 per cent of households given their meagre asset endowments and the pressure of government policies toward sedentarization. The results strongly suggest that livelihood diversification does not improve welfare for pastoral households. Future development interventions should promote policies that enable households to regain flexible access to pastures and should aim to correct the imbalance of opportunities that exists in northern Xinjiang.

AB  - With increasing usage of electronic devices, people are creating digital footprints of their everyday actions. These footprints come in the form of big data, and can provide useful insights into customer preferences, thus enabling companies to gain business benefits. However, customers may perceive usage of their personal information as a threat. The telecommunications sector is facing this issue. It is capable of collecting huge amount of data due to wide usage of smartphones and mobile Internet. Yet, it is unable to capitalize on these data. To manage customer perception of information risks in giving telecommunications companies permission to use their personal information, this study examines factors that influence customers? risk perception. A survey of 512 Internet panel members in Korea shows that information practices play an important role in shaping information privacy concerns, trust, and perceived information risks. Information privacy concern is the strongest predictor of perceived information risks, followed by perceived data control, and trust. Perceived policy awareness and perceived information protection significantly influence perceived data control. The findings imply that telecommunications companies ought to increase the level of customer trust, improve their information practices, and reduce customers? information privacy concerns if they want to lower customer perception toward information risks.

AB  - Web surveys are becoming increasingly popular in survey research including stated preference surveys. Compared with face-to-face, telephone and mail surveys, web surveys may contain a different and new source of measurement error and bias: the type of device that respondents use to answer the survey questions. This is the first study that tests whether the use of mobile devices, tablets or smartphones, affects survey characteristics and stated preferences in a web-based choice experiment. The web survey on expanding renewable energy production in Germany was carried out with 3182 respondents, of which 12% used a mobile device. Propensity score matching is used to account for selection bias in the use of mobile devices for survey completion. We find that mobile device users spent more time than desktop/laptop users to answer the survey. Yet, desktop/laptop users and mobile device users do not differ in acquiescence tendency as an indicator of extreme response patterns. For mobile device users only, we find a negative correlation between screen size and interview length and a positive correlation between screen size and acquiescence tendency. In the choice experiment data, we do not find significant differences in the tendency to choose the status quo option and scale between both subsamples. However, some of the estimates of implicit prices differ, albeit not in a unidirectional fashion. Model results for mobile device users indicate a U-shaped relationship between error variance and screen size. Together, the results suggest that using mobile devices is not detrimental to survey quality. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper examines the economic logic underlying bundles and tie-in sales and uses the lessons learned from that examination to analyze seven specific instances of bundling that have been the subject of antitrust scrutiny or other policy initiatives. Of particular interest are products that are nonrivalrous in consumption, making all-you-can-eat pricing a viable candidate for efficiency. The main economic points are the following: À-la-carte pricing may populate economic models, but most products are bundles. They are bundles because bundles are generally more efficient. Tie-in sales are much less common and often not properly understood in textbook discussions. Market foreclosure, the principal efficiency concern with tying and bundling, is likely to be exceedingly rare. The seven instances of bundling (ties) examined in the paper are: cable television; patent pools; blanket licenses; iPods and iTunes; telephones; music albums and songs; operating systems and component programs. © The Author (2008).

AB  - Dynamic pages and the increasing number of functions that websites can perform are changing users' relations with the Web. Little has been reported on how the experience of using this kind of interactive site differs from the 'point and click' interactivity of the early Web. This paper reports on a qualitative study of users who entered text while visiting a website of their choice. It shows how the process brought with it two levels of awareness: that of the interface, and that of the social context beyond the interface. The paper goes on to describe the perception of audience that emerged from analysing users' accounts. It also gives details of the data collection method, which is based on the work of Vermersch and has not been widely used outside France for analysing interaction with computers. The implications for website design are considered. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The goal of this study is to gain a detailed understanding of the experience of instructors who have been using Tablet PCs (TPCs) for their teaching practice. The study examines the lived experience of 28 faculty members from a College of Engineering which is promoting the diffusion of TPCs in the classroom. Phenomenology was adopted to answer the question 'What is it like to use a TPC to teach a course?' Written applications, one-on-one interviews, classroom observations, and an online discussion board are the data sources. From the iterative process of qualitative data analysis, four common themes emerged in terms of converting to digital resources, teaching by handwriting on the screen, becoming comfortable with technology, and human enjoyment of using the TPC.

AB  - With the implementation of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on 25 May 2018, a new regulatory regime for business in Europe and beyond has begun. Many companies had to adjust their data processing processes to meet GDPR compliance requirements. GDPR stipulates that data controllers must have a legal basis for the collection and processing of personal data. One of the most common ways for personal data to be collected and shared online is through website cookies. A cookie is a small text file that is downloaded onto 'terminal equipment' when the user accesses a website. It allows the website to recognise that user's device and store some information about the user's preferences or past actions. Cookies, insofar as they are used to identify users, qualify as personal data and are therefore subject to the GDPR. The investigative problem of this study is expressed through the following question: Which requirements are applied to cookie usage now that the GDPR has come into effect, and what impact has this had on Lithuania's top popular websites? The main purpose of this article is to assess the tendencies as regards the usage of the cookies in accordance with GDPR requirements on the most popular Lithuanian websites. The methodological framework used in the investigation is based on scientific literature analysis and the qualitative research method. The work carried out theoretical narrative, systematic, comparative analysis, and generalisation. A qualitative case study was carried out examining the 100 most popular Lithuanian websites. The obtained empirical findings demonstrate that Lithuanian websites use cookies in breach of GDPR requirements and that complex violations occur. In Lithuania, unlike the other EU Member States, violations pertaining to cookie management continue to remain unnoticed, organisations do not abide by GDPR requirements en masse, whereas individual users and the State Data Protection Inspection are merely passive observers. The conclusions and recommendations of the research have practical value, which will help organisations, users and supervisory authorities to identify the violations connected to cookie usage and to take the relevant measures in order to ensure that data are being processed lawfully and in keeping with GDPR requirements.

AB  - This cross-country survey research investigated the relationship between screen addiction and media multitasking and examined factors that mediate and moderate this relationship. The web survey recruited Internet users owning multiple devices in the United States (N = 798) and Taiwan (N = 834). Although American users spent longer time on screen devices and engaged more in media multitasking more, Taiwanese respondents had higher screen addiction. Results showed that media multitasking and screen device use were positively related to screen addiction. Country of respondents' residence moderated the relationship between media multitasking and screen addiction. Additionally, screen device usage mediated the positive effects of media multitasking on screen addiction. Finally, leisure boredom moderated screen device usage's mediating effects on the relationship between media multitasking and screen addiction, which differed in two countries. Young people and females tended to have high levels of screen addiction. Implications of screen addiction and media multitasking were discussed.

AB  - Billiards is a sport that not only requires numerous skills, but also emphasizes the strategies of planning the path of the contact and shot. Traditional billiards training mainly focuses on skills practicing, while the strategies for facing different kinds of challenges in billiards competitions are usually ignored. Therefore, referring to social constructivism, the current study proposed an ASQI (annotation, summarizing, questioning and interflow) mobile flipped learning approach to strengthen students’ pre-class learning effectiveness via engaging them in social interaction contexts to share experience and strategies of dealing with different billiards competition cases. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The participants were 80 university students from two classes; one class learned with the ASQI mobile flipped learning approach while the other adopted the traditional flipped learning approach. The results showed that ASQI could significantly enhance students’ billiards skills performance and online learning engagement with no influence on task load. In addition, according to the students’ feedback, ASQI could help students 'make effective use of strategies,' 'improve learning performance' and 'promote reflection.'

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a research model examining users' perceived needs-technology fit of mobile communication software through motivational needs and technological characteristics. The study investigated the effects of perceived needs-technology fit on user satisfaction and intention to continue using mobile communication software.
Design/methodology/approach - This study proposes a research model based on task-technology fit theory and uses and gratification theory, incorporating key determinants of users' continuance intention toward mobile communication software. An online survey instrument was developed to collect data, and 403 questionnaires were used to test the relationships in the proposed model.
Findings - The causal model was validated using AMOS 21.0, and all nine study hypotheses were supported. The results indicated that users' perceived needs-technology fit and satisfaction were crucial antecedents of their intention to continue using mobile communication software and that they mediated the influence of users' needs as well as technological characteristics.
Practical implications - Mobile communication software practitioners should focus on enhancing users' perceived needs-technology fit through motivational needs (utilitarian, hedonic, and social needs) and technological characteristics (mobile convenience, service compatibility, and user control) to further boost user satisfaction and intention to continue using mobile communication software services.
Originality/value - This study contributes to a theoretical understanding of factors explaining users' continuance intention toward mobile communication software.

AB  - Mobile instant messaging (MIM) has been gaining in popularity in China due to its free and user-friendly nature. Few scholarly studies have investigated factors affecting the adoption of MIM among Chinese youth. This web survey examined perceived characteristics of MIM and its adopter characteristics among 18 to 30 year-old users in China. The study found that the majority of Chinese youths adopted WeChat and Mobile QQ services and used texting most often. Socialization was their main purpose of using MIM. More than 75% of respondents used it to connect with friends, colleagues, and classmates. The results also showed age had a negative influence on the adoption levels of MIM while compatibility, perceived popularity, and perceived playfulness were positively associated with MIM usage among Chinese youths. Contrary to prior studies, perceived trialability of MIM was negatively related to MIM use. The implications of MIM usage and adoption are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In the past, most studies used the technology acceptance model (TAM) to survey the subjective perception of users in using information technology. The usability test was also used to assess the ease of use of user interfaces. This study introduces a conceptual framework to explore the relationship between user's beliefs of TAM and usability testing attributes. Usability testing was conducted on an eCampus learning system with a mobile device. TAM data was collected from the participants for analyzing a possible relationship. The findings of this study reveal that TAM results contradict the usability test results in certain areas. The focus of our proposed research model is supported from the causality between perceived ease of use and usability; however, the correlation between perceived usefulness and usability remains unclear.

AB  - Increased time spent online in combination with current Internet trends such as social networking have led to new risks for online harassment. This problem has been given much attention for adolescents, but little has been done to describe the risks of online harassment experienced by young adults, even though they exhibit Internet behavior comparable to adolescents. This study is in part a replication of a previous study that surveyed online harassment within a college population (Finn 2004). Three questions are addressed: (1) What is the prevalence of online harassment among undergraduate students at a large southwestern university? (2) What is the relationship between the senders and receivers of harassing communications? (3) What are the demographic and computer use variables associated with increased risk of online harassment? A cross-sectional survey was administered to a convenience sample of 420 undergraduates, and the final response rate was 81.4 percent (n = 342). Survey questions included items from the Finn (2004) study, and new questions about technological trends. The Finn study reported a 16.2 percent rate of online harassment compared to 43.3 percent in the current study. Computer use variables were significant in predicting the likelihood of being harassed online, e.g. time on social networking sites, owning an Internet connected phone, and having ever sent a text message; overall demographic variables were not significant. Online harassment is an issue deserving attention from researchers, lawmakers, parents, and university communities. Further research should investigate how students are coping with harassment, including reporting practices. Evidence-based interventions targeting this emerging issue are greatly needed.

AB  - One of the most significant and obvious examples of how mobile communication influences our understanding of time and space is how we coordinate with one another. Mobile communication enables us to call specific individuals, not general places. Regardless of location, we are able to make contact with almost anyone, almost anywhere. This advancement has changed, and continues to change, human interaction. Now, instead of agreeing on a particular time well beforehand, we can iteratively work out the most convenient time and place to meet at the last possible moment—on the way to the meeting or once we arrive at the destination. In their early days, mobile devices were primarily used for various types of emergency situations and for work. In some cases, the device was an essential element in various business operations or used so that overseas workers could communicate with their families. The distance between a remote posting and the people back home was suddenly and dramatically reduced. People began to share these devices not necessarily out of economic issues, but also questions of family and interpersonal dynamics. The process of sharing decisions as to who is a legitimate partner makes the nature of relationships more explicit. By examining the economy of sharing, we not only see how sharing mobile phones restructures social space, but are also insight into an individual's web of interactions. This cutting-edge book deals with modern ways of thinking about communication and human interaction; it will illuminate the ways in which mobile communication alters our experience with space and time.

AB  - While the choice of matrix versus item-by-item questions has received considerable attention in the literature, it is still unclear in what situation one is better than the other. Building upon the previous findings, this study expands this line of research by examining whether the difference between the two question types is moderated by the number of response options. Through a web survey experiment, this study compares matrix and item-by-item questions with 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, and 11 response options. Additionally, we also investigate the impact of the device used to complete the survey on data quality. The results show that straight lining and response time are similar between the two question types across all response lengths, but item nonresponse tends to be higher for matrix than item-by-item question, especially among mobile respondents. Also measurement models reveal measurement equivalence between the two question types when there are fewer than seven response options. For matrices with 9 or 11 response options, analyses reveal substantial differences compared to item-by-item questions.

AB  - The adoption of ride-sharing apps is critical to the survival of taxi drivers in the mobile-driven sharing economy. Based on survey data collected from 1195 licensed taxi drivers in Beijing, the authors present an integrated technology adoption model that combines technology and use factors (perceived usefulness and ease of use), social factors (word-of-mouth, peer adoption and subjective norms), system factors (socioeconomic and digital inequality), and audience factors (demographic characteristics and innovative personality traits). The results showed that adoption was innate, inherited, and socially driven. Adoption was positively associated with income, access to technologies, innovative personality trait, peer adoption, word-of-mouth, and perceived usefulness of the apps. The implications of the findings for inequality in the sharing economy are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The purpose of this study is to explore factors affecting individuals' usage of Mobile Securities Management System (MSMS). On the basis of an extensive review of literature in Task Technology Fit (TTF) theory and Mobile Commerce (MC) adoption, a revised TTF model is proposed and tested using data collected from an online survey of 440 respondents. The results show that: the fit between task and technology positively affects MSMS usage, while alternative systems play a negative role; functions of MSMS, self-efficacy and experience are important factors affecting the fit; MSMS adopting does not heavily depend on the macro-environment of the stock market. Implications for improving other types of MC applications adoption are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - A key question for retailers who already offer a mobile website is, whether they should add an app as an additional purchase channel. We address this issue by exploring whether consumers' app adoption stimulates additional purchases and how this change in purchase behavior differs across customers with different levels of spending share for different product categories and customer loyalty. By using transactional data from a Chinese online retailer, we show that app adopters have higher purchase incidence, buy more frequently, and spend more in each order than non-adopters. We also find that app adoption has a stronger positive effect on the order size of customers who have a lower spending share of high-price products and customers who are less loyal to the focal retailer. Hereby, we contribute to multichannel and mobile marketing literature by empirically examining the effects of adding a similar (mobile) purchase channel to an already established (mobile) purchase channel. Managerially, our results suggest that apps are worth investing in despite their similarity to mobile websites and can induce non-loyal customers to purchase more and thus potentially foster these customers' loyalty.

AB  - It is becoming increasingly easy for researchers to develop context-aware applications for smartphones. A perennial challenge, however, is to convince a large number of people to install them and donate contextual data for scientific purposes. Our empirical study seeks to address this challenge by investigating how people's perception and attitude affect their willingness to donate context data to researchers and quantifies the effects of social signals on donation action-taking. Our findings indicate that the perceived need for donation and perceived organization reputation are key determinants in deciding whether to donate: people with altruistic personality do not necessarily donate if they cannot see the need to take an action. Furthermore, we provide evidence that even if people indicate a willingness to donate, they are hesitant to take action towards donating data unless catalysts like social signals (hints about the actions of others) are present.

AB  - Previous studies have documented that psychological distress is related to problematic mobile phone use (PMPU), and sporadic research has investigated the potential mechanisms underlying the association. Based on the cognitive-behavioral model of pathological Internet use (PIU), the self-control theory, and the problem-behavior theory, this study aimed to examine the mediating role of maladaptive cognitions toward mobile phones and the moderating role of effortful control between psychological distress and PMPU. Data were collected from 1,799 secondary school students (45.1% male; M-age = 14.07, SD = 1.69) using four self-reported questionnaires. The results revealed that maladaptive cognitions toward mobile phones partially mediated the relationship between psychological distress and PMPU. In addition, effortful control as a protective factor attenuated the indirect effect from psychological distress to PMPU. These findings advanced the understanding of the etiology of PMPU and the need to develop effective strategies for prevention, suggesting that schools and families should pay additional attention to students with psychological distress. Targeted interventions for integrating online and offline worlds and effortful control training programs may help to prevent adolescents from engaging in PMPU.

AB  - This paper aims to examine the effects of important determinants such as ubiquitous connection, context-aware, reputation and familiarity on consumers' purchase intention by the path of trust and social benefit in mobile commerce. Data were collected from an online survey system. The formal questionnaire consisted of two sections. Section 1 measured respondent perceptions of each construct in the research model. Section 2 aimed to understand respondent basic personal data. The study results indicate that both trust and social can positively influence purchase intention in mobile commerce. Ubiquitous connection and familiarity fail to influence trust directly but can influence purchase intention by the path of social benefit as expected. The research extends the literature on consumers' purchase intention identifying the importance of ubiquitous connection, context-aware, reputation and familiarity and probing into the relationship of trust, social benefit and purchase intention. The results suggest prescriptive strategies for mobile commerce sellers. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This paper examines the effect of the freemium strategy on Google Play, an online marketplace for Android mobile applications. By analyzing a large panel data set consisting of 711 ranked mobile apps, we found that the freemium strategy is positively associated with increased sales of the paid mobile apps. Positive trial experience as represented by high review rating of the free version of a mobile app leads to higher sales of its paid version, whereas high visibility of the free version of a mobile app as represented by its product rank does not have a significant impact on the sales of its paid version. This finding suggests that although offering a free trial version is a viable way to improve the visibility of a mobile app, offering a quality free app is more important in boosting sales of the paid app. Moreover, we found that the impact of review rating is reduced when the free version is offered, or when the mobile app is a hedonic app, because consumers have the ability to experience the app themselves before purchase. These findings extend understanding of the freemium business model to include a market characterized by simultaneous intra-market competition for both the freemium and paid products and demonstrate how such dynamics may influence sales of the paid products.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to explore factors affecting individuals' usage of Mobile Securities Management System (MSMS). On the basis of an extensive review of literature in Task Technology Fit (TTF) theory and Mobile Commerce (MC) adoption, a revised TTF model is proposed and tested using data collected from an online survey of 440 respondents. The results show that: the fit between task and technology positively affects MSMS usage, while alternative systems play a negative role; functions of MSMS, self-efficacy and experience are important factors affecting the fit; MSMS adopting does not heavily depend on the macro-environment of the stock market. Implications for improving other types of MC applications adoption are discussed.

AB  - Incorporating peer and professional social support features into remotely delivered, technology-supported physical activity interventions may increase their effectiveness. However, very little is known about survivors’ preferences for potential social features. This study explored breast cancer survivors’ preferences for both traditional (e.g., coaching calls and peer support) and innovative (i.e., message boards and competitions) social support features within remotely delivered, technology-supported physical activity interventions. Survivors [N = 96; Mage = 55.8 (SD = 10.2)] self-reported demographic and disease characteristics and physical activity. A subset (n = 28) completed semistructured phone interviews. Transcribed interviews were evaluated using a thematic content analysis approach and consensus review. Following interviews, the full sample self-reported preferences for social features for remotely delivered physical activity interventions via online questionnaires. Questionnaire data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Four themes emerged from interview data: (a) technology increases social connectedness; (b) interest in professional involvement/support; (c) connecting with similar survivors; and (d) apprehension regarding competitive social features. Quantitative data indicated that most survivors were interested in social features including a coach (77.1 per cent), team (66.7 per cent), and exercise buddy (57.3 per cent). Survivors endorsed sharing their activity data with their team (80.0 per cent) and buddy (76.6 per cent), but opinions were mixed regarding a progress board ranking their activity in relation to other participants’ progress. Survivors were interested in using a message board to share strategies to increase activity (74.5 per cent) and motivational comments (73.4 per cent). Social features are of overall interest to breast cancer survivors, yet preferences for specific social support features varied. Engaging survivors in developing and implementing remotely delivered, technology-supported social features may enhance their effectiveness.

AB  - Background: In recent years, the Fear of Missing Out (FoMO) construct has been the object of growing attention in digital technology research with previous studies finding support for the relationship between FoMO and problematic smartphone use (PSU) among adolescents and young adults. However, no previous studies clarified the causal link between FoMO and PSU using a longitudinal design.
Methods: An auto-regressive, cross-lagged panel design was tested by using a longitudinal dataset with two waves of data collection (T0 and T1, one year apart). Participants included two hundred and forty-two adolescents (109 males and 133 females), with a mean age of 14.16 years, who filled out the Fear of Missing Out scale (FoMOs) and the Smartphone Addiction Scale (SAS). Moreover, participants filled out the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), at the first time-point of data collection.
Results: The findings of the study show that FoMO (both FoMO-Fear and FoMO-Control subscales) and PSU are positively related at both time-points (i.e. at a cross-sectional level). However no cross-lagged associations between them were longitudinally supported. Females and older adolescents show higher FoMO-Fear at T1.
Conclusions: The findings of the present study suggest caution when causal links between FoMO and PSU are inferred.

One key requirement was the ability to quantify the effectiveness of the audio map, so we describe the design and implementation of the evaluation, which took the form of a game downloaded by participants to their own computers. The results demonstrate that participants (blind, partially sighted and sighted) have acquired detailed spatial knowledge and also that the availability of positional audio cues significantly improves wayfinding performance. © The Author 2013.

AB  - Introduction: Self-reported levels of disability in individuals with low back pain (LBP) have not improved in the last decade. A broader perspective and a more comprehensive management framework may improve disability outcomes. We recently developed and validated the Low Back Pain and Disability Drivers Management (PDDM) model, which aims to identify the domains driving pain and disability to guide clinical decisions. The objectives of this study were to determine the applicability of the PDDM model to a LBP population and the feasibility of conducting a pragmatic trial, as well as to explore clinicians’ perceived acceptability of the PDDM model’s use in clinical settings. Methods: This study was an one-arm prospective feasibility trial. Participants included physiotherapists working with a population suffering from LBP and their patients aged 18 years or older presenting with a primary complaint of LBP that sought a new referral and deemed fit for rehabilitation from private and public clinical settings. Clinicians participated in a one-day workshop on the integration of the PDDM model into their clinical practice, and were asked to report various LBP-related outcomes via self-reported questionnaires (i.e., impact of pain on physical function, nervous system dysfunctions, cognitive-emotional factors, work disabilities) at baseline and at six-week follow-up. Physiotherapists’ acceptability of the use of the PDDM model and appreciation of the training were assessed via semi-structured phone interviews. Analyses focused on a description of the model’s applicability to a LBP population, feasibility outcomes and acceptability measures. Results: Applicablity of the PDDM model was confirmed since it successfully established the profile of patients according to the elements of each categories, and each of the 5 domains of the model was represented among the study sample. Trial was deemed feasible contingent upon few modifications as our predefined success criteria for the feasibility outcomes were met but feasibility issues pertaining to data collection were highlighted. Twenty-four (24) clinicians and 61 patients were recruited within the study’s timeframe. Patient’s attrition rate (29%) and clinicians’ compliance to the study protocol were adequate. Clinicians’ perceived acceptability of the use of the model in clinical settings and their appreciation of the training and online resources were both positive. Recommendations to improve the model’s integration in clinical practice, content of the workshop and feasibility of data collection methods were identified for future studies. A positive effect for all patients’ reported outcome measures were also observed. All outcome measures except for the PainDetect questionnaire showed a statistically significant reduction post-intervention (p<0.05). Conclusion: These findings provide preliminary evidence of the potential of the PDDM model to optimize LBP management as well as conducting a future larger-scale pragmatic trial to determine its effectiveness.

AB  - Abstract: This study examines the question of whether the geographical digital divide in China has reduced with the introduction of mobile, including 3G, telecommunications. Geographical digital divide is measured primarily by teledensity at the provincial level. Changes of the geographical digital divide over time are analyzed within the framework of hardware, software, and other factors. Following this analytical framework, mobile or wireless telecommunications has higher potential of equipping the poor and narrowing the digital divide, especially in developing countries. In terms of hardware, the installation cost of wireless technology is often lower than fixed-line telephone services, especially in remote rural areas and/or areas of difficult terrains. The hardware required by users, notably mobile handsets, is also cheaper to own than personal computers (PCs). In terms of software, a greater variety and more flexible packages are often offered for mobile telecommunication services, and most applications on mobile phones are simpler and more user-friendly. Moreover, the requirements of mobile technologies on some other key factors known to affect information and communication technology (ICT) adoption rates are also lower. In particular, the requirements for language, especially English, proficiency and computer literacy are lower. Furthermore, proactive government measures have been implemented in China to narrow the digital divide through supportive policies influencing the factors named above. Under these circumstances, the well-known association between economic growth and widening digital divide (a difficult dilemma faced by governments of most developing countries) has been reversed in China after 2005.

AB  - In vibration experiments demanding long-duration measurements, traditional point-wise techniques are often employed, despite the availability of high-speed digital image correlation. This is due to the high volume of images generated by the latter technique, which limit acquisition times and lengthen post-processing times. In this experimental investigation, it is demonstrated that standard frame rate charge-coupled device cameras yield results for the mean deflected shape of a reinforced aerospace panel subject to a random broadband excitation between 0 and 800?Hz that are not statistically different to those from high-speed cameras. The images from both types of camera were processed using digital image correlation to generate out-of-plane displacement maps, which were then decomposed using Chebyshev descriptors for ease of comparison and to determine the mean deflected shape. The results indicate that, with appropriate sampling rates and durations, standard frame rate charge-coupled device cameras can be used to study broadband random excitation behavior of structures when mean behavior needs to be characterized over long time scales compared to the excitation wavelengths. This is contrary to accepted procedures, but offers comparable accuracy with substantially reduced computational resources compared to using high-speed cameras, as well as effectively unlimited data acquisition periods, which is useful in condition monitoring, for example.

AB  - Background and aims: Gaming applications have become one of the main entertainment features on smartphones, and this could be potentially problematic in terms of dangerous, prohibited, and dependent use among a minority of individuals. A cross-national study was conducted in Belgium and Finland. The aim was to examine the relationship between gaming on smartphones and self-perceived problematic smartphone use via an online survey to ascertain potential predictors. Methods: The Short Version of the Problematic Mobile Phone Use Questionnaire (PMPUQ-SV) was administered to a sample comprising 899 participants (30% male; age range: 18–67 years). Results: Good validity and adequate reliability were confirmed regarding the PMPUQ-SV, especially the dependence subscale, but low prevalence rates were reported in both countries using the scale. Regression analysis showed that downloading, using Facebook, and being stressed contributed to problematic smartphone use. Anxiety emerged as predictor for dependence. Mobile games were used by one-third of the respective populations, but their use did not predict problematic smartphone use. Very few cross-cultural differences were found in relation to gaming through smartphones. Conclusion: Findings suggest mobile gaming does not appear to be problematic in Belgium and Finland.

AB  - With the adoption and popularization of internet-based platforms, sports betting has introduced new functionalities that transform the design of its products and therefore the way bettors interact with them. This study aims to explore the association between the use of new structural characteristics of online betting and gambling severity. Five characteristics are examined here: (i) live in-play betting; (ii) cash out feature use (as example of in-play betting in-built features); (iii) fantasy sports gaming; (iv) location of betting; and (v) device or platform used to make bets. A cohort (N=659) of Spanish gamblers who had bet on sports during the previous year was recruited through an online survey. The results suggested that those bettors scoring higher on gambling problems also utilized more often such new structural characteristics, in a proportion not explained only by their higher overall gambling activity. Mobile betting was especially frequent among problem gamblers.

AB  - Over the last few years, we have witnessed a generalization of the consumption of video contents through different media (computers, television, mobile phones, tablets,...) that converge into a unified user experience in an (almost) all-IP technological environment. At the same time, there have been significant advances in the generation and characterization of multimedia contents, due to the advent of social networking and the consolidation of standards like moving picture experts group (MPEG)-4 and MPEG-7. Finally, it is becoming easier and more natural to interact with multimedia contents, thanks to devices like tactile screens and touchpads. Overall, this landscape enables great possibilities for advertising and e-commerce, far beyond the traditional business models of broadcast TV. In this paper, we present a novel realization of two non-invasive advertising and e-commerce models to exploit those possibilities, grounded on a cloud-based personalization engine. This system cannot only identify the most interesting products to advertise to each user at any time, but also compose personalized applications on the fly, ready to run on different consumer device platforms. Our experiments show that this proposal can be very positively perceived by the end users. © 2012 The Author.

AB  - The CAL09 conference had as its central focus ‘learning in digital worlds’, both real and virtual. In that sense many of the papers in this special reflect key concepts of co-operation, interaction and dynamism—a sense of operating in learning spaces rather than one of being operated on. At CAL09 the topics under discussion largely focused on the student experience of this innovation; both as a tool for learning and for assessment. The changing roles of key educational stakeholders, pupils, parents and teachers are brought to the fore in the papers of this issue. The articles present research questions and methodologies in the variety of contexts from artificial intelligent design, to blended learning in HE, interactivity in school classrooms settings, and mobile learning in physical and virtual worlds.

AB  - The Internet is rapidly evolving from a resource used primarily by the research community to a true global information network offering a wide range of databases and services. This evolution presents many opportunities for improved access to biomedical information, but Internet-based resources have often been difficult for the non-expert to develop and use. The World Wide Web (WWW) supports an inexpensive, easy-to-use, cross-platform, graphic interface to the Internet that may radically alter the way we retrieve and disseminate medical data. This paper summarizes the Internet and hypertext origins of the WWW, reviews WWW-specific technologies, and describes current and future applications of this technology in medicine and medical informatics. The paper also includes an appendix of useful biomedical WWW servers.

AB  - A web-based survey was conducted of ergonomics practitioners holding certifications in the U.S., Canada, Great Britain, Australia, and New Zealand. The survey follows 12 years after an earlier initial survey reported by Dempsey et al. (2005). Approximately 1221 eligible participants were invited by e-mail to participate, and 405 surveys were included in the final analysis. The survey queried use of basic instruments relevant to ergonomic practice as well as more specific analytical tools such as observational techniques for assessing postural demands of work and instrumentation for direct measurement of such demands. Some ergonomic assessment methods appear to have increased in their overall use by U.S. ergonomists compared to 2005 data. This was observed for: RULA, REBA, Psychophysical Upper Extremity Data, Strain Index, and ACGIH TLV for Hand Activity Level. There is minimal evidence of increased overall use of direct measurement approaches in the U.S. There appear to be geographic differences between countries/continents in terms of use of various methods. The use of mobile device/smart phone "apps" by ergonomists was queried and these technologies presently appear to be in early adoption phase with 24-28% of practitioners reporting use of an app in their ergonomics practice.

AB  - Smartphone use is ubiquitous, however, scholarly debate regarding the addictive nature of smartphones abounds. In this context, it is integral to distinguish between the content that users experience and the medium that facilitates access to the former, as users may experience addictive-like responses to the specific activities they engage in through the context experienced rather than the device that facilitates access to these activities. The present study aimed to explore conceptualizations of smartphone addiction by (a) investigating user preferences for specific smartphone functionalities, (b) examining behavioral changes associated with limited access to preferred functionalities, and (c) exploring links between aspects of smartphone use and self-reported psychological well-being. A total of 471 participants completed an online survey, providing data on sociodemographics, actual and hypothetical smartphone usage, and psychological well-being (depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms). The results showed that communication functionalities were most frequently cited as being preferred among smartphone users. Notably, participants reported that they would check their smartphones significantly fewer times if their top-three functionalities were inaccessible. This suggests that smartphone users are likely to become addicted to the functionalities they access on their smartphones (content) and not the smartphones themselves (medium), rendering unviable the notion of smartphone addiction as a construct. Further analyses suggested negligible to small correlations between aspects of smartphone use and psychological well-being variables. The findings imply that rather than focusing on frequency of smartphone use, it is recommended that future research examines the type and quality of specific smartphone usages and their effects on user well-being.

AB  - Contemporary audiences have abundant access to news anywhere, anytime and through a wide range of media. Due to the short length of news items, they do not require prolonged attentional focus. Consequently, the genre is consequential for performing simultaneous activities, which are related (i.e. second screening) or unrelated (i.e. media multitasking) to the content of the news items. Despite the potential of second screen activities to increase the political participation of young people, and the fact that adolescents are heavy users of digital media, there is almost no data on the extent to which they perform such activities. Also, there are almost no comparative data about the rates of news video consumption of adolescents vs. adults.
This descriptive study analyzes how adolescents and adults consume news video content in an era of second screens. For four consecutive days, subjects reported their viewing behaviors using a dedicated mobile application. Results demonstrate that adolescents consume significantly less news video content compared to adults; smartphones occupy a more prominent role in their news consumption behavior compared to adults; and they are significantly more involved in Second Screening activities. Implications of the findings for understanding adolescents' contemporary media ecology are examined.
Impact Summary
(a) Prior State of Knowledge
Young people are the primary age group that consumes news content mainly on digital platforms, and simultaneously performs multitasking and second screening activities.
(b) Novel Contributions
Adolescents' consumption habits are significantly different from those of adults: they consume less news, the smartphone occupies a more prominent role in their news consumption behavior, and they are significantly more involved in second screening activities.
(c) Practical implications
The question of how adolescents consume news content has sparked significant interest of scholars and parents alike. As adolescents are in a developmental stage in which they socialize and acquire habits that will affect them later in life, an understanding of their media consumption habits can have significant consequences contemporarily, and possibly at later stages in their lives. The paper provides novel insights about adolescents' news consumption patterns.

AB  - Purpose: Timely and adequate rehabilitation after a stroke is crucial to maximising recovery. A way of increasing treatment access could be through robots, which would aid therapists in providing post-stroke rehabilitation. This research sought to discover the needs and preferences of therapists with respect to a robot that focuses on upper limb rehabilitation. Understanding requirements for devices could help to increase integration into clinical practice. Methods: An international online survey was distributed through professional organisations and e-mail list services to therapists. The survey contained 85 items covering topics such as therapist background and treatment approach, rehabilitation aims and robotic rehabilitation device attributes. Results: Data were analysed for 233 respondents, most of whom were physiotherapists and occupational therapists from Australia, Canada and USA. Top attributes included: facilitating a variety of arm movements, being usable while seated, giving biofeedback to clients, having virtual activities specific to daily living, being useful in-home and having resistance adjustable to client needs. In addition, the device should cost under 6000 USD. Conclusions: Findings from this survey provide guidance for technology developers regarding therapists’ specifications for a robotic device for upper limb rehabilitation. In addition, findings offer a better understanding of how acceptance of such devices may be facilitated. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Mobile applications are increasingly regarded as important tools for an integrated strategy of infection containment in post-lockdown societies around the globe. This paper discusses a number of questions that should be addressed when assessing the ethical challenges of mobile applications for digital contact-tracing of COVID-19: Which safeguards should be designed in the technology? Who should access data? What is a legitimate role for "Big Tech" companies in the development and implementation of these systems? How should cultural and behavioural issues be accounted for in the design of these apps? Should use of these apps be compulsory? What does transparency and ethical oversight mean in this context? We demonstrate that responses to these questions are complex and contingent and argue that if digital contract-tracing is used, then it should be clear that this is on a trial basis and its use should be subject to independent monitoring and evaluation.

AB  - Objective: Previous research on the beneficial effects of physical activity mostly focused on adult samples, although daily physical activity engagement is crucial for children's healthy development. The current study examines associations between preschool-aged children's physical activity, positive affect, and self-regulation during their everyday lives. Both direct and indirect associations between physical activity, positive affect, and self-regulation were investigated. Methods: For seven consecutive days, 98 children aged four to six years wore a tri-axial accelerometer (ActiGraph wGT3X-BT) to assess their moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). During this week, parents rated their children's daily positive affect and self-regulation every evening either by an online questionnaire or via a phone interview. Results: A multilevel structural equation model revealed direct positive associations between daily MVPA and positive affect (within-person level) and between positive affect and self-regulation (within- and between-person levels). There were no direct positive associations between MVPA and self-regulation (within- and between-person level); at the within-person level, a small, unexpected negative association between MVPA and emotional self-regulation was found. MVPA and self-regulation were indirectly related through positive affect on a daily basis. Conclusions: Engaging in more MVPA than usual on a given day was positively associated with preschoolers' daily positive affect, which was associated with higher daily self-regulation levels. Whereas physical activity seems to have short-term associations on a daily basis, positive affect seems to facilitate children's self-regulation skills both intra- and inter-individually.

AB  - The importance of the impact of IT for organizations around the world, especially in light of a very slow recovery from the global financial crisis, has amplified the need to provide a better understanding of the specific geographic similarities and differences of IT managerial and technical trends. Going beyond identifying these influential factors is also the need to understand the considerations for addressing them in light of recognizing the respective local characteristics, especially when operating in a globally linked environment, although somehow heavily influenced locally. By comparing and contrasting IT trends from different geographies, this paper presents important local and international factors (e.g., management concerns, influential technologies, budgets/spending, organizational considerations) necessary to prepare IT leaders for the challenges that await them. It can also serve as an indicator as the respective geographies evolve from the economic conundrum. The research is based on data from four geographic regions (United States (US), Europe, Asia, and Latin America). The same questionnaire (although translated for the respective respondents), based on the lead authors well-respected and long-running Society for Information Management survey, was applied across the geographies. This paper presents the major findings based on survey responses from 620 respondents (275 US, 100 European, 59 Asian, and 186 Latin) in mid-2011. The top five management concerns were: (1) IT and business alignment; (2) business agility and speed to market; (3) business process management and business process reengineering; (4) business productivity and cost reduction; (5) IT reliability and efficiency. The five most influential technologies were: (1) business intelligence; (2) enterprise resource planning systems; (3) cloud computing; (4) mobile and wireless applications; (5) customer relationship management.

AB  - Respondents in an Internet panel survey can often choose which device they use to complete questionnaires: a traditional PC, laptop, tablet computer, or a smartphone. Because all these devices have different screen sizes and modes of data entry, measurement errors may differ between devices. Using data from the Dutch Longitudinal Internet Study for the Social sciences panel, we evaluate which devices respondents use over time. We study the measurement error associated with each device and show that measurement errors are larger on tablets and smartphone than on PCs. To gain insight into the causes of these differences, we study changes in measurement error over time, associated with a switch of devices over two consecutive waves of the panel. We show that within individuals, measurement errors do not change with a switch in device. Therefore, we conclude that the higher measurement error in tablets and smartphones is associated with self-selection of the sample into using a particular device.

AB  - This study sought to overcome some of the methodological limitations in previous studies and clarify the role of attachment in the associations between texting and romantic relationship satisfaction. Specifically, a new, relative measure of texting usage was created to estimate the share of texting in communication compared to other channels (e.g., face-to-face, phone, and etc.), in addition to using the traditional, absolute measure of texting usage (i.e., the number of texts sent to partners). A sample of 395 participants completed an online survey regarding texting behavior. Background variables were controlled for in all analyses, particularly the physical distance between partners, which was often overlooked in previous research. The results suggested that texting share showed positive links with both attachment dimensions and a negative link with relationship satisfaction, whereas the sheer volume of texts had little association with attachment dimensions or satisfaction.

In this paper, we propose a process control model in Web-based e-Learning, and illustrate how to implement process control through learning path with workflow technology. This model improves the learning efficiency by providing instructors tools to design courses with learning paths and select the popular learning objects. It also enables students to achieve an orderly learning experience through defined learning path.

AB  - This article uses data from a representative survey on the applications of information and communication technologies to investigate the use of the mobile phone as a cultural object by different groups of respondents/consumers. Setting out from the premise that the symbolic and artefactual nature of new media, their 'thingness', should be a central part of any investigation of their social and cultural significance, the article focuses on the meaning of the mobile phone as a cultural object and commodity sign for various groups of users/consumers. It also concentrates on the social structuring of mobile phone use by young people and addresses the relationship between class and the practices and meanings of mobile phone use in the context of young people's consumption of other media and cultural technologies. It addresses one of the central questions in the sociology of culture-how are consumption tastes and practices related to class-and examines it through the case of mobile phone use. The study suggests that the general 'technosensibility' of young people, which seems a universal generational phenomenon, when interpreted in the context of the consumption of other 'old' and 'new' media and cultural consumption in general, is differentiated according to class and cultural capital. The article concludes that class distinctions produce a digital divide that results in two distinct populations of young users: the interacting and the interacted users.

AB  - This study investigated whether any of seven factors of family dysfunction predicted five risk factors for developing eating disorders in young adult women. Participants completed demographic questions, the McMaster Family Assessment Device (Epstein, Baldwin, & Bishop, 1983) and the Setting Conditions for Anorexia Nervosa Scale (Slade & Dewey, 1986) online. Five stepwise multiple regressions evaluated whether FAD scores predicted any of the eating disorder risk factors. Unhealthy affective responsiveness predicted general dissatisfaction and social and personal anxiety, and unhealthy general functioning predicted adolescent problems. No FAD factors predicted perfectionism or weight control. These results confirm the importance of families' affective responsiveness and general functioning to the risk of developing eating disorders. However, the lack of relationship among problem-solving, communication, roles, affective involvement, or behavior control with any of the risk factors for eating disorders warrants further investigation.

It is theoretically and practically meaningful to systematically reveal how mobile technology generates users' virtual experience and, subsequently, the behavioral response. To fill the gaps, drawing on the Stimulus-Organism-Response model, this paper regards flow as the core experience based on the features of the mobile users' experience. The framework is that mobile technology will promote users' virtual experience, and in turn, affect their behavioral response. This study uses online survey data from 452 respondents. We employ the structural equation model based on the partial least squares method and further mediation analysis by the Sobel test to validate the research hypotheses. Our results show that the mobile technology environment has a significantly positive effect on users' purchase intention/return mediated by the virtual experience. However, the direct relationship between ubiquity and flow, as well as telepresence and intention to purchase/return, are not significant. Finally, a few theoretical and managerial contributions are also discussed.

AB  - In theory, off-farm work, by raising household incomes, can have a direct impact on smartphone use among rural residents and the use of these smartphones in turn enhances incomes by facilitating online financial transactions, easing management tasks, strengthening social networks, providing technical services, and reducing exposure to risks. In light of this, this paper assesses the impact of participation in off-farm work on smartphone use, using an endogenous switching probit model and a survey of 493 rural households in China. The joint impacts of off-farm work participation and smartphone use on household income are also analyzed using a control function method. The results show that participation in off-farm work increases the probability of smartphone use significantly. Furthermore, we find that the household heads who engaged in off farm activities and who were smartphone users earned 3430 Yuan and 2643 Yuan more per capita annual income, respectively, compared to their full-time farming and smartphone-free counterparts.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify enablers and inhibitors to the adoption of mobile internet services by socioeconomically disadvantaged people: an understudied population adversely affected by digital inequality.
Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative study combining a questionnaire and semistructured interviews. In total, 32 socioeconomically disadvantaged people explored mobile lottery services and subsequently were asked a series of semi-structured questions about their perceptions of the technology.
Findings - Users' attitudes toward mobile internet services were ambivalent. They experienced some advantages of smartphones (including escaping spatiotemporal constrains, fashionableness, privacy, and cost-effectiveness) and conceived of mobile internet services in terms of social advantages (including their ubiquitous nature, fitting in socially and fear of being "left behind"). However, they also experienced barriers and concerns, such as limited mobile data packages, external barriers from mobile services (including security concerns, complex online help tutorials, irrelevant pop-ups, and a lack of personalized services) and internal psychological barriers (including technophobia, self-concept, and habitus).
Research limitations/implications - The findings are of limited generalizability due to the small size of the sample. However, the study has implications for understanding the acceptance of technology among socioeconomically disadvantaged people. Social implications - The study has social implications for bridging digital inequality in terms of socioeconomic status.
Originality/value - While previous studies have primarily focused on enablers of adopting mobile internet services by active users, this study reveals both the promise of and the barriers to the use of such services by inactive users who comprise an under-served population.

AB  - Smart cities are built upon information and communication technologies (ICTs) to enable a broad range of advanced services. Through a comprehensive literature review, this study identified four pitfalls brought by the pervasive application of ICT, including information insecurity, privacy leakage, information islands, and digital divide. Therefore, a questionnaire survey together with 27 interviews was conducted in Hong Kong to investigate how the public perceived these pitfalls within the context of mobile apps providing real-time parking information which form a major part of smart mobility. System insecurity and privacy leakage were found to arouse worries among the app-users while their awareness of protecting personal data was found to have room for improvement. Islands of real-time parking information occur as a result of the lack of collaboration among private carpark operators. Digital divide existed widely among the disadvantaged groups and the problem cannot be solved by mere provision of ICT facilities. Overall, technologies alone cannot make a city smart or smarter. It is the suitable way in which ICTs are used to serve all citizens that matters. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Abstract: Using a qualitative research approach, this study examines the appropriation of digital technologies and their implications for the reception of the so-called ‘pirate’ radio in Zimbabwe. It specifically explores how the use of the Internet (and its associated digital technologies), including the mobile phone by two prominent ‘underground’ radio stations, Short Wave (SW) Radio Africa and Voice of America’s Studio 7, beaming into Zimbabwe from the UK and the US, respectively, has impacted on the reception of their content. Drawing on reception theory, the paper highlights the ambiguities and complexities associated with the reception of (pirate) radio in the era of convergence in Africa. It argues that while both SW Radio Africa and Studio 7’s multiple digital transmission strategies have broadened the range of options available for the reception of their content (albeit in disproportionate ways), traditional forms of reception remain in force. This is largely because of enduring questions of access to digital technologies (especially the Internet), and the lasting connections between traditional live radio and the oral traditions of local culture. These contextual factors sustain reception practices that differ markedly from the scenario in the economically developed world of the North where digital technologies have radically redefined radio reception practices. Similarly, the mobile phone has expanded options for the generation and reception of news content from the radio stations thus pointing to the fact that in Africa convergence can indeed assume unique forms, shaped by an intricate combination of local socio-economic and cultural factors.

AB  - Customization of Web-based applications is often considered a designer skill rather than an end-user need. However, there is an ongoing shift to end-user-centred technology, and even users with poor or no skill in Web-based languages may feel the need to customize Web applications according to their preferences. Although Web authoring environments have an increasing number of features, the challenge of providing end-users with the ability to easily customize entire Web applications still remains unsolved. In this paper, we propose an intelligent approach to customizing Web-based applications. Customizations rules are automatically inferred by the system from changes that users supply as examples. They remain as long-term knowledge that can be applied to support future interactions, thus minimizing the amount of authoring that end-users need to do for this purpose. In order to better understand the implications of the user's modifications, they are analysed using the logical descriptions of the corresponding Web pages. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Microvolunteering is bite-size volunteering with no commitment to repeat and minimum formality, involving short and specific actions. Online microvolunteering occurs through an internet-connected device. University students' online microvolunteering decisions were investigated using an extended theory of planned behavior (TPB) comprising attitudes and normative and control perceptions, with the additional variables of moral norm and group norm. Participants (N=303) completed the main TPB questionnaire and 1-month follow-up survey (N=171) assessing engagement in online microvolunteering. Results generally supported standard and additional TPB constructs predicting intention. Intention predicted behavior. The findings suggest an important role for attitudes and moral considerations in understanding what influences this increasingly popular form of online activity.

AB  - Purpose - The video-sharing website YouTube encourages interaction between its users via the provision of a user comments facility. This was originally envisaged as a way for viewers to provide information about and reactions to videos, but is employed for other communicative purposes including sharing ideas, paying tributes, social networking, and question answering. This study seeks to examine and categorise the types of comments created by YouTube users to highlight the various ways in which this interactive feature has been employed as a means of communication and self-expression.
Design/methodology/approach - By conducting a content analysis of 66,637 user comments on YouTube videos the authors created a classification schema which may be used to categorise the types of comments users leave.
Findings - The schema reveals ten broad categories, and 58 subcategories which reflect the wide-ranging use of the YouTube comments facility.
Research limitations/implications - As YouTube continues to evolve, new types of comments that do not appear in the scheme outlined will appear. However, this schema will provide an initial structure upon which other investigations can build when analysing the ongoing use of the YouTube comments feature as a communication device.
Practical implications - This scheme may be used for researchers in a variety of disciplines who are interested in using user-generated content. The scheme will aid in the description and mining of this content and provides a way of structuring this content into categories representing user intent.
Social implications - This study highlights the variety of purposes to which the user commenting facility of YouTube is employed. These include purposes such as reminiscence, grieving, giving advice and communication.
Originality/value - This is the first detailed, content-based analysis. of the types of comments created by YouTube users. The classification scheme facilitates the analysis of these comments for a variety of purposes, including marketing, communication studies and studies of information seeking.

AB  - In this article, the effect of a local, content (as opposed to structure) oriented navigation tool is investigated, i.e. mouse-over hyperlink previews. A usability experiment is described in which three groups of participants were exposed to three different versions of a website: without hyperlink previews, with content oriented, semantic previews, and with task-oriented, pragmatic previews. Participants were asked to execute search and recall tasks, and to evaluate task and hypertext. The results showed a decisive overall advantage for previews in terms of efficiency, but no effects on effectiveness or appreciation. Although semantic and pragmatic previews did not differ significantly, a post hoc analysis showed a learning effect of pragmatic previews that was absent in the semantic preview condition. It was concluded that previews fit in with the step-by-step goal orientation of hypertext users. Once users are acquainted with them, pragmatic previews speed up decision making. Apart from the experimental part, the article surveys research into the usability of navigation tools, thereby focusing on the analysis of navigation tools. The bottom line of this review is that most navigation tools as they are used in the experiments provide users with different types of information, e.g. local vs. global, content vs. structure oriented. This complicates the unequivocal explanation of their effect and may explain, together with user and task differences, the variety and inconsistencies observed in the results. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The question of mobile Roma beggars in Europe has been analysed in terms of securitization, racialization, and deportability. These people have been hailed as ‘abject’ or ‘failed’ citizens, the problem of race being made largely invisible. In the Swedish context, the category of race does not emerge in overt form, and Swedes generally imagine themselves to be an egalitarian and just society. However, in Stockholm, in 2015, the unprecedented visibility of rough sleeping EU-migrants turned daily chance meetings tasks into ‘ethical encounters’. Using the concept of enacting citizenship and the Narrative Policy Framework, this article analyses day-to-day narratives about ‘vulnerable EU citizens’ constructed by the media and experts in the winter of 2015 in Stockholm. Most press narratives would silence the voices of migrants, framing them as passive victims, their problem being defined in terms of extreme temperature, thus making cold weather the principle villain. With regard to acts of citizenship, the paper analyses expert opinions on the migrants’ performance. Their stories and discourse reveal the image of a ‘vulnerable EU citizen’: one of a passive, begging, distressingly visible individual who is failing to perform citizenship. This shortcoming is regarded here as contributing to the justification of a wider policy framework in which the migrants’ claims are seen as unfounded and undeserved, while their attitude is viewed as unappreciative, although they would allegedly not be racialized as a group.

AB  - Text messaging is an asynchronous communication tool for both utilitarian and entertainment activities. The purpose of this study is to investigate the self-determined motivation of text messaging behaviours through Self-Determination Theory (SDT). Data collected via a web-based survey were used to examine the effects of autonomy, competence and relatedness on self-determined Short Message Service (SMS). Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) revealed that only competency and relatedness increase self-determined SMS, while autonomy affected it negatively. The result implies that the ability to engage in personal communication and the desire to become socially connected are the essence of SMS internal motivation. This study also suggests that higher self-determined information technology usage reduces freedom to disengage from it and that obligated communication becomes another determining factor of usage. Practitioners and researchers can benefit from these findings by incorporating self-determined usage behaviours into work play aspects of modern day ubiquitous computing usage.

AB  - Real-time response (RTR) measurement is an important technique for analyzing human processing of electronic media stimuli. Although it has been demonstrated that RTR data are reliable and internally valid, some argue that they lack external validity. The reason for this is that RTR measurement is restricted to a laboratory environment due to its technical requirements. This paper introduces a smartphone app that 1) captures real-time responses using the dial technique and 2) provides a solution for one of the most important problems in RTR measurement, the (automatic) synchronization of RTR data. In addition, it explores the reliability and validity of mobile RTR measurement by comparing the realtime reactions of two samples of young and well-educated voters to the 2013 German televised debate. Whereas the first sample participated in a classical laboratory study, the second sample was equipped with our mobile RTR system and watched the debate at home. Results indicate that the mobile RTR system yields similar results to the lab-based RTR measurement, providing evidence that laboratory studies using RTR are externally valid. In particular, the argument that the artificial reception situation creates artificial results has to be questioned. In addition, we conclude that RTR measurement outside the lab is possible. Hence, mobile RTR opens the door for large-scale studies to better understand the processing and impact of electronic media content. [web URL: http://poq.oxfordjournals.org/content/80/2/542.abstract]

AB  - This study explores some features of slider bars in the context of a multi-device web survey. Using data collected among the students of the University of Trento in 2015 and 2016 by means of two web surveys (N = 6,343 and 4,124) including two experiments, we investigated the effect of the initial position of the handle and the presence of numeric labels on answers provided using slider bars. It emerged that the initial position of the handle affected answers and that the number of rounded scores increased with numeric feedback. Smartphone respondents appeared more sensitive to the initial position of the handle but also less affected by the presence of numeric labels resulting in a lower tendency to rounding. Yet, outcomes on anchoring were inconclusive. Overall, no relevant differences have been detected between tablet and PC respondents. Understanding to what extent interactive and engaging tools such as slider bars can be successfully employed in multi-device surveys without affecting data quality is a key challenge for those who want to exploit the potential of web-based and multi-device data collection without undermining the quality of measurement.

AB  - Purpose This study investigates perceptions of the use of online tracking, a passive data collection method relying on the automated recording of participant actions on desktop and mobile devices, for studying information behavior. It scrutinizes folk theories of tracking, the concerns tracking raises among the potential participants and design mechanisms that can be used to alleviate these concerns. Design/methodology/approach This study uses focus groups composed of university students (n = 13) to conduct an in-depth investigation of tracking perceptions in the context of information behavior research. Each focus group addresses three thematic blocks: (1) views on online tracking as a research technique, (2) concerns that influence participants' willingness to be tracked and (3) design mechanisms via which tracking-related concerns can be alleviated. To facilitate the discussion, each focus group combines open questions with card-sorting tasks. The results are analyzed using a combination of deductive content analysis and constant comparison analysis, with the main coding categories corresponding to the thematic blocks listed above. Findings The study finds that perceptions of tracking are influenced by recent data-related scandals (e.g. Cambridge Analytica), which have amplified negative attitudes toward tracking, which is viewed as a surveillance tool used by corporations and governments. This study also confirms the contextual nature of tracking-related concerns, which vary depending on the activities and content that are tracked. In terms of mechanisms used to address these concerns, this study highlights the importance of transparency-based mechanisms, particularly explanations dealing with the aims and methods of data collection, followed by privacy- and control-based mechanisms. Originality/value The study conducts a detailed examination of tracking perceptions and discusses how this research method can be used to increase engagement and empower participants involved in information behavior research.

AB  - The widespread use of mobile devices is leading towards their adoption in the learning process, even if some pedagogical challenges are still not fully addressed when integrating mobile-assisted activities into regular curricula activities. In this paper, we first define some guidelines to design a general, tailorable, and platform-independent mobile learning system. Second, we present the aCME system, a mobile infrastructure, developed by adhering to the defined guidelines, to provide a general-purpose system, easy to start up with and friendly to user, and finally, tailorable, i.e., that can be easily adapted to the needs of different learning environments. The aCME system has been implemented as a Web-based architecture, to provide content and functionalities for different contexts, accessible from any location and by using any communication device. Finally, we describe a tool, deployed into aCME, that allows responding to quiz-based questionnaires during learning activities. A preliminary evaluation was performed to analyze usability and user satisfaction when interacting with the system we developed. The paper is concluded with some comments and future research directions.

AB  - An increasing number of people are tracking their fitness activities, work performance and leisure experiences using body sensors (e.g., wristbands or smartwatches) and mobile applications. This trend, referred to as self-quantification, is driven by various motivations, from curiosity to a desire to improve performance. As self-quantification by means of digital devices is a new behavioural trend, the phenomenon has only recently received academic attention. Neither antecedents nor the implications of this phenomenon have been thoroughly investigated. This paper aims to address these gaps. Based on the literature on self-quantification, privacy and self-disclosure, we empirically test the relationship among personality traits, privacy, self-quantification and self-disclosure. The findings suggest that conscientiousness and emotional stability are associated with self-quantification. In addition, we find a significant effect of self-quantification on self-disclosure in the survey context, indicating that individuals who habitually use self-tracking applications and wearable devices are also more likely to disclose personal data in other contexts.

AB  - The amount of time adolescents spend communicating via digital technologies such as smartphones has led to concerns that computer-mediated communication (CMC) is displacing face-to-face (FtF) interactions and disrupting social development. Although many studies have examined CMC in adolescents' relationships with friends, few studies have examined the role of CMC in adolescents' renegotiation of closeness and autonomy with parents. To examine this issue, we administered an online daily diary with 169 U.S. adolescents to estimate the time they spend in CMC and FtF interactions and the number of texts they exchange with friends and parents. On the last day of the survey, we asked adolescents about their emotional closeness to friends and parents and their balance of closeness and volition with parents. Overall, we found more evidence for social stimulation than displacement effects of CMC. Texts and CMC time with friends predicted friend closeness after accounting for FtF time with friends; texts with parents predicted parent closeness after accounting for FtF time with parents. We also found support for our hypothesis that CMC would be associated with greater adolescent volition. CMC time with parents predicted greater volitional dependence (volition plus closeness) whereas texts with friends predicted greater independent decision-making (volition plus distance). We discuss how communication technologies are integrated into U.S. adolescents' relationships with friends and parents and how CMC can facilitate, rather than stifle, adolescents' adjustment of autonomy-relatedness with parents and their construction of emotional closeness with friends.

AB  - Abstract Objective This study surveyed the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the audiology workplace. Design The study used a cross-sectional survey design for audiologists across the globe (n = 337) using an online survey (June–August 2020) focussing on changes to the workplace during the pandemic. Results Participants represented varied work settings and audiology services. Only a third (31.5%) provided psychosocial support, which may be important during the pandemic, as part of their services. Almost all (97%) audiologists reported changes to their workplace, with 76.4% reporting reduced caseloads during the COVID-19 pandemic. When rating their current and anticipated work conditions, 38.7% reported reduced working hours although only 13.8% anticipated reduced working hours in 6-months’ time. Audiologists ranked services such as access to hearing assessment, hearing device adjustment and maintenance, and general audiological support as being more important during the pandemic than services such as psychosocial, emotional and tinnitus support. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant disruptions to audiological practice that highlights the need to adapt and incorporate new audiological practices including telehealth, to ensure patients have continued access to care and clinics remain sustainable during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and recovery phase.

AB  - After ECN was first added to IP in 2001, it was hit by a succession of deployment problems. Studies in recent years have concluded that path traversal of ECN has become close to universal. In this article, we test whether the performance enhancement called ECN++ will face a similar deployment struggle as did base ECN. For this, we assess the feasibility of ECN++ deployment over mobile as well as fixed networks. In the process, we discover bad news for the base ECN protocol: contrary to accepted beliefs, more than half the mobile carriers we tested wipe the ECN field at the first upstream hop. All packets still get through, and congestion control still functions, just without the benefits of ECN. This throws into question whether previous studies used representative vantage points. This article also reports the good news that, wherever ECN gets through, we found no deployment problems for the "++" enhancement to ECN. The article includes the results of other in-depth tests that check whether servers that claim to support ECN actually respond correctly to explicit congestion feedback. Those interested can access the raw measurement data online. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Internet survey data collection was introduced at the end of 1980's with email surveys. In the mid 1990's, the World Wide Web (WWW) began to be used for survey data collection and this is the most widely spread form today. In the last few years, we face the integration of technologies resulting in WebTV or digital TV surveys, M-CASI—computer assisted self-interviewing using mobile phone devices, and other integrated solutions (e.g., integrated CATI—computer assisted telephone interviewing systems). In this chapter, we refer to the form of Internet surveys that are most often used today, which is web surveys that are computerized, self-administered questionnaires (CSAQ) answered without the presence of an interviewer.

AB  - A growing portion of internet users rely solely on mobile devices such as smartphones for their online access The percentage of "mobile-only" households increased from 9% in 2011 to 20% in 2015, more than doubling in only four years. As this shift continues, it leads to the question of what factors are driving the rise in mobile-only adoption. Using nationally representative data, this study uses logistic regressions and a decomposition technique to understand the trend. The decomposition reveals that a significant portion (65%) of the growth was due to an increase in the download speeds of mobile networks. An increased acceptance of mobile-only access by households aged 55 and older was also partly responsible. Understanding (and developing a response to) the trend towards mobile-only adoption will be important as organizations and governments continue to work to close the digital divide.

AB  - Frank Easterbrook's seminal analysis of error-cost minimization in The Limits of Antitrust has special relevance to antitrust intervention in markets where innovation is a critical dimension of competition. Both product and business innovations involve novel practices. Historically, the economics profession has tended initially to rely upon monopoly explanations for such practices. Courts have reacted with similar hostility. But almost always there has followed a more nuanced economic understanding of the business practice that recognized its procompetitive virtues. Antitrust standards have adjusted occasionally to reflect that new economic learning. This sequence has produced a fundamental link between innovation and antitrust error that transcends the uncontroversial point that the probability of false positives and their social costs are both higher in the case of innovation and innovative business practices. We discuss some principles for applying Easterbrook's error-cost framework to innovation. We then discuss the historical relationship between antitrust error and innovation. We conclude by challenging the conventional wisdom that the errorcost approach implies that the rule of reason, rather than per se rules, should apply to most forms of business conduct. We instead identify simple filters to harness existing economic knowledge to design simple rules that minimize error costs. We make five such proposals. © The Author (2010).

AB  - Objective We show how the HL7 Virtual Medical Record (vMR) standard can be used to design and implement a data integrator (DI) component that collects patient information from heterogeneous sources and stores it into a personal health record, from which it can then retrieve data. Our working hypothesis is that the HL7 vMR standard in its release 1 version can properly capture the semantics needed to drive evidence-based clinical decision support systems. Materials and Methods To achieve seamless communication between the personal health record and heterogeneous data consumers, we used a three-pronged approach. First, the choice of the HL7 vMR as a message model for all components accompanied by the use of medical vocabularies eases their semantic interoperability. Second, the DI follows a service-oriented approach to provide access to system components. Third, an XML database provides the data layer. Results The DI supports requirements of a guideline-based clinical decision support system implemented in two clinical domains and settings, ensuring reliable and secure access, high performance, and simplicity of integration, while complying with standards for the storage and processing of patient information needed for decision support and analytics. This was tested within the framework of a multinational project (www.mobiguide-project.eu) aimed at developing a ubiquitous patient guidance system (PGS). Discussion The vMR model with its extension mechanism is demonstrated to be effective for data integration and communication within a distributed PGS implemented for two clinical domains across different healthcare settings in two nations.

AB  - The increasing popularity of text-based computer mediated communication, such as instant messaging and mobile texting, have resulted in the emergence of a new pictographic form of language, i.e. emoji, offering an intuitive and informal way to convey emotions and attitudes, replacing words or phrases in text messages. Based on these characteristics, could identification with emoji be associated with personality? Could they be used instead of text-based items in personality assessment? The present study aimed at exploring these questions. The sample is composed of 234 young adults recruited online (age: M = 24.79, SD = 6.47; 62% female). Participants responded to a brief Big-Five personality questionnaire and a 91-item survey assessing participants' degree of self-identification with emoji selected from the Apple Color Emoji fontset. Results indicated that 36 out of 91 examined emoji are significantly related with three of the Big-Five personality traits—emotional stability, extraversion, and agreeableness—that are consistently linked with emotion and affective processing. Emoji-based measures of these personality traits show moderate-to-large concurrent validity with scores from a validated personality questionnaire (r = 0.6–0.8). Overall, our study advances the idea that emoji might be employed to develop a language-free assessment tool for personality. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The aim of this paper is to evaluate the use of mobile instant messaging (MIM) apps from the perspective of the user. The objective is to verify what is the perceived usefulness, perceived value of use and usability of this new channel of communication utilized with customers and to verify if there are premises for considering instant messaging services as a new platform for customer engagement. Drawing from the Technology Acceptance Model, this study tests the consumers' perception of the use of mobile services with organizations. Data was made available for analysis from an online survey of 470 respondents. Results show that customers see MIM apps as an effective tool for customer care. Moreover, interaction through MIM apps adds value to the customer-brand relationship. MIM apps used as support to the relationship with customers can contribute to customer care, revealing it to be an excellent marketing tool in support of the customer journey. This research extends the understanding of customer engagement in the ambit of the instant messaging application used for business that so far has not been investigated. This work shows how instant messaging can optimize the benefits deriving from the adoption of disruptive innovations. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Aim: The aim of this study was to explore the management of type 1 diabetes in Australian primary schools: kindergarten-Year 2, from the parent’s perspective. The study questions were: What diabetes treatment is being delivered? Who is providing the treatment? Where is the treatment given? Methods: A cross sectional, descriptive approach was used to collect data from parents (66) of children with type 1 diabetes attending an Australian primary school (kindergarten-Year 2). An online self-administered questionnaire was designed in Survey Monkey and was available via a dedicated Facebook page. Data were analysed using statistical analysis (SPSSv21). Results: Blood glucose testing was occurring for all children, with 49% of children self testing. 77% of children were receiving an insulin bolus or injection at school. 34% was provided by the child and 53% of insulin was given via pump. Teachers, parents and teacher’s aides also provided insulin at school. There was a statistically significant association between the number of children receiving insulin at school and the insulin delivery device, χ² = 16.75, df = 1, p ≤ 0.000). Children using insulin pump therapy were more likely (97%) to receive insulin at school than children who used injections (55%). Children who were able to self-administer insulin were more likely to receive insulin (93%) at school than children who were unable to self-administer insulin (65%) (χ² = 7.38, df = 1, p = 0.007) 81% of children received diabetes treatment in the classroom, with the remainder in the school administration office. Conclusion: Insulin administration across Australian primary schools was inconsistent. Not all children were receiving the recommended insulin treatment. Insulin pump therapy appears to increase access to this treatment at school. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The use of mobile communication has expanded rapidly over the past decade. More than fifty percent of US adults now live in a cell phone only household (Blumberg and Luke, 2017), and close to 60% use their phones to access the internet (Pew Research Center, 2017). Survey researchers and respondents have adapted to this change, and many telephone surveys achieve at least 70% of completes from a cellular frame (Langer, 2015, Pew, 2017, Gallup, 2016), and up to 40% of completes on web surveys are from mobile devices (Saunders, 2015; McGeeney, 2015; Lugtig, Toepoel and Amin, 2016; Marlar 2018). This dramatic shift to mobile devices has raised concerns among survey researchers about the potential impact on measurement (Lavrakas et al., 2010; Kennedy and Everett, 2011; Peytchev and Hill, 2010; Buskirk, 2011; Buskirk and Andrus, 2012; Antoun et al., 2018). 
This dissertation builds upon previous research on mode differences to understand how mobile devices impact measurement, either within a mode or across modes. I explore three main research objectives: (1) do telephone survey responses and data quality differ across cellular and landline respondents, (2) do web survey responses and data quality differ across mobile device and computer respondents, and (3) do we still find measurement mode differences between telephone and web responses when mobile devices are included in comparisons?
Overall, I find little evidence that respondents answer questions differently on mobile and traditional devices, controlling for demographics. Mean scores, probability of giving a most positive or negative response, and measures of data quality were similar between landline and cellular respondents and desktop and mobile respondents. Scale design had no meaningful impact on measurement differences between devices.
Consistent with earlier work on measurement mode differences, telephone respondents give significantly more positive responses to attitudinal questions than web respondents (Dillman, 1991; Dillman et al. 1996; de Leeuw, 2005; Dillman and Christian, 2005; Brick and Lepkowski, 2008; Christian, Dillman, and Smyth, 2008). My research provides evidence that previous finding on mode differences hold with the inclusion of mobile devices. Further, there was not a scale format that effectively minimized differences between modes.

AB  - This study aimed to determine contact and privacy risks encountered by Malaysian adolescents with access to the Internet and mobile phones and factors associated with face-to-face meetings with online acquaintances as well as to estimate the prevalence of subsequent victimization. Secondary school students from randomly selected public schools in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur responded to an anonymous self-administered questionnaire (78% response rate). Out of 3,349 Internet or mobile phone users, 51% had been invited to meet offline with an online-meeting acquaintance and 30% complied. Of the 1,005 respondents who went to offline meetings, 55% had meetings with more than six people. Male gender, Malay ethnicity, online access at an Internet café, viewing pornography on the Internet, the absence of parental restrictions on visiting certain website and chat rooms, not being explicitly forbidden to meet strangers encountered online, and disclosure of personal information were significantly associated with increased odds of face-to-face meetings with online acquaintances. Verbal, physical, or sexual assaults were reported by 5.5% of the 1,005 including 13 males and five females who reported forced sexual intercourse. Similarities as well as differences in factors associated with risk-taking behavior compared with adolescents in Western countries have important implications on policy and intervention.

AB  - Background: The study reported in this article focuses on an exploration of the role and nature of play in young children’s use of toys that connect physical and digital domains. Purpose: The purpose of the article is to explore the nature of the connections that are made in play that transverses physical and virtual domains. The article draws on posthuman theory to explain some of the complexity of the play that occurs in these contexts. Research Design: The research took place in the United Kingdom, and the overall study consisted of four distinct stages: (a) A survey of 2,000 parents of children aged 0–5 years, focusing on children’s access to and use of tablet apps; (b) case studies of preschool children’s use of apps in six families; (c) observations of children aged 3–5 years in a school using apps; and (d) content and multimodal analysis of apps. The focus of this article is on (b), although some of the survey data from the first stage of the study are also shared to provide context. Data Collection and Analysis: The focus for this article is the play of a three-year-old girl, Amy. In addition to ethnographic data constructed over a 2-month period (field notes, interviews, photographs, and films), Amy’s mother collected data between the researchers’ visits by making films of her daughter’s use of apps. Amy also collected data herself by wearing a GoPro chestcam. The data that inform the analysis in this article are from a film created by Amy (11:05 minutes) and a video filmed by Amy’s mother (5.21 minutes). Data were both inductively analyzed using multimodal (inter)action analysis and deductively analyzed using a posthumanist approach. Findings: Amy’s play connected digital and nondigital components in complex ways. An app and related physical object that typify the Internet of Toys provided opportunities for Amy’s play to take place across physical and digital domains, and the inorganic objects embedded in the electronic toy and related app were an important element of this play, shaping Amy’s responses at times. However, Amy’s play was not always determined by the design of the electronic objects, and she demonstrated agency within play episodes. There were multiple connections made across a variety of domains/ dimensions, which added to the complexity of the play. Conclusions/Recommendations: Young children’s play increasingly connects digital and nondigital domains, and posthumanist theories can enhance understanding of how connections across these time/spaces are made.

AB  - This study explores the role of mobile news in democracy by examining individual-level variations in mobile election news use based on demographics, socioeconomic indicators, and mobile media activity breadth, and, in turn, how mobile news use is associated with political participation. Nationally representative data from a random-sample survey of American adults (N = 2,250) in the 2010 general election were analyzed to better explain who mobile election news users are, how they compare to nonusers, and whether mobile news use was associated with voter turnout and mobile campaign donation. Findings underscore the significance of mobile media use and mobile news as phenomena of emerging importance in the election campaigns, and important differential patterns in the relationships of sociodemographics, mobile media, and electoral participation are discussed. By providing a nuanced accounting of the socioeconomic and demographic profile of mobile election news users and how those individuals differ from nonusers, this study enriches explanations of how societal privilege and the benefits of political engagement are related in complicated ways to individual-level variations in consuming and using mobile election news. Notably, for racial minorities, mobile media may provide a bridge across the digital-driven democratic divide and a more effective means of engaging with digital election information than other ICTs. Analysis also extends what is known about how citizens use mobile news to engage with increasingly personalized election campaigns. Results indicate that mobile election news use was a significant positive predictor of the odds of having voted and whether individuals used their mobile devices to make contributions during the campaign. These findings support arguments that the unique qualities of mobile devices are contributing to new and different pathways to political engagement while also retaining significance in relation to traditional forms of offline political participation.

AB  - This study investigates online resource theory by focusing on mobile communication's role in political engagement. The effects of mobile media use on online political engagement are explored through a random-sample survey of how citizens used mobile devices during the 2012 US presidential election. Controls for demographics, political interest, and ideological strength provide context for understanding individual-level differences. Younger, better educated respondents who were more likely to be politically interested and self-described as possessing stronger political ideologies were more likely to engage with the election campaign through their mobile phones. Users' mobile media activity breadth produced the strongest positive association with online political engagement. Also, the interactive association of political interest and mobile media activity breadth reinforced political interest's influence on engagement. Findings support and extend literature on the positive but complicated role of mobile and digital technology in the deployment of online resources for political engagement. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Over the last 10 years, the dramatic increase in access to information communications technologies (ICTs) in developing countries has spurred popular efforts to use them for crisis response and violence prevention. As access to mobile phones and the internet has expanded, a key question remains: Do people actually use these tools for participation in governance processes? The results from my case studies and survey data strongly indicate that they do not. Even among groups we expect to be technologically savvy, for example the young, urban and/or wealthy, patterns of information gathering during crisis are still oriented toward traditional broadcast media and elite messaging. Instead, the evidence from my case studies and surveys indicate that people make decisions about the validity and actionability of information during crises based on complex social and political factors that are tangentially related to technology access.   This dissertation contributes deeper theorization of the role of ICTs in crisis response, drawing on the political science and sociology literature on collective action and violence prevention. This social-theoretical grounding is important because while technologists and engineers have pushed for innovative use of ICTs in crisis response and international development more widely, there remains limited understanding of how these technologies, and the information shared across them, are used by communities to support socio-political processes, including violence prevention and disaster response. To make my theoretical argument I frame crises and crisis response as a collective action problem; communities who are trying to have a peaceful election or manage limited resources after a natural disaster have to keep people engaged in the collective process of maintaining stability. What ICTs should do in this scenario is lower the barriers to information sharing across large populations and wide geographic spaces, which is a key aspect of maintaining a collective action process.    Using case studies of election violence prevention in Kenya and disaster response in Samoa, as well as survey data on the preferred sources and mediums of information people use to take action during crisis, I hypothesized that when people have access to a full spectrum of ICTs they will prefer gathering information though horizontally integrated digital social networks, instead of via vertically integrated broadcast media. I also hypothesize that these effects will be larger among younger, more urban, and wealthier survey respondents. In both the samples from Kenya and Samoa, people across all demographic groups overwhelmingly prefer broadcast and official information when making decisions about what to do during elections and after natural disasters, which ran contrary to my expectations. What is more important to respondents when deciding which information to trust and act on is their previous social and political experiences during elections and post-disaster recovery. Access to government services, political representation, and the geographic distribution of social and familial networks were more salient to respondents when they were deciding where to gather information and how to act on it.   To bring the theoretical and empirical analysis back to the larger question about the use of ICTs in crisis response and violence prevention, I analyze a selection of interventions where international organizations used ICTs in crisis response and violence prevention, discussing how different agency programs encouraged (or failed to encourage) local level information sharing and collective action. This will provide theoretically grounded context for how peace and humanitarian operations practitioners can better develop and tailor technology-supported programming to be more congruous with local information sharing behavior. The dissertation closes with an analysis of the overall findings, implications for the field of technology for peace building and disaster response, and future avenues for research.

AB  - Purpose The aim of this exploratory study is to analyze if the most used factors related to the engaging interaction and long-term engagement with online applications can be applied to WhatsApp in a context of everyday life in Madrid and to investigate what parameters would best describe the engagement with WhatsApp in this context. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative method was employed to explore the cognitive, emotional and behavioral factors that mainly comprise the experience of a user with an online application, both at a point in time and over time. Data from 30 semi-structured interviews and questionnaires from six group chats were collected and analyzed. The sample was made up of people aged from 13 to 58 years old. Findings Findings suggest that the factors used in this study to evaluate long-term engagement and engaging interactions with WhatsApp are relevant, except for cognitive factors related to engaging interactions, indicating that the cognitive point of view is more difficult to apply in the engaging interaction analysis. Other attributes related to information retrieval are suggested, best suited to the informative use of this tool. Originality/value Long-term engagement studies are scarcer concerning Mobile Instant Messaging applications. Regarding engagement interaction, its analysis focusing on WhatsApp has not been approached. This study suggests the convenience of using parameters related to information to evaluate the engaging interaction, according to the informative use of the application.

AB  - Based on data collected through the Net Children Go Mobile survey of approximately 3500 respondents aged 9?16?years in seven European countries (Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Romania and the United Kingdom), this article examines the diffusion of smartphones among children and contributes to existing research on mobile digital divides by investigating what influences the adoption of smartphones among children and whether going online from a smartphone is associated with specific usage patterns, thus bridging or widening usage gaps. The findings suggest the resilience of digital inequalities among children, showing how social inequalities intersect with divides in access and result in disparities in online activities, with children who benefit from a greater autonomy of use and a longer online experience also reaching the top of the ladder of opportunities.

AB  - This article explores the comparability of assessment tools under different format conditions. Prior studies have not considered the interaction of format and device on time to complete an assessment and have instead treated each of them separately with conflicting results. This study assesses, by linear regressions using web-based data, the performance of multiple devices under varying formats while controlling for non-device factors such as demographic information. The results of this study add to the growing literature on the equivalence among devices and formats used to collect and interpret performance in a variety of organizational settings.

This paper offers insight into the experiences of those involved in obtaining regulatory approval of drug-device combination products in the European Union and the United States.Methods:The research consisted of two phases, qualitative data collection (through semi-structured interviews) and analysis, followed by quantitative data collection (through an online survey) and analysis.Results:A conceptual model was developed that depicted the facilitating factors for obtaining regulatory approval of a drug-device combination product, relevant to the European Union and United States systems, respectively.Conclusions:This model provides, for the first time, a comprehensive understanding of these factors, providing a foundation that could be adapted to reflect specific drug-device combination products. This research demonstrated originality of approach in interviewing thought leaders in the life sciences sector as well as conducting a survey that spans two of the largest jurisdictions for drug-device combination products in the world.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to make a case generally for an ontology for accessibility requirements specification. Requirements specification is generally intended to provide clear, testable descriptions of what a system should do. What an ontology would do is to act like a requirements bank that provides methodology independent accessibility requirements that could then be used to extrapolate, on demand, conceptual models for a variety of implementations driven by a variety of methodologies. The effect of this would be to minimise requirements specification, ensure declarativity, standardisation, interoperability and reusability, whilst at the same time lending greater migratability from specification to design. There has been much worldwide action in developing guidelines, tools and methods in an attempt to ensure that technologies and information systems are accessible. There is, however, a growing need to partner these initiatives more closely with software engineering traditions. An ontology for accessibility requirements would provide formal semantic specifications beyond the syntactic provisions rendered by commonly used formal specification languages. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The vision that digital finance can achieve universal financial inclusion is premised on the rarely questioned assumption that the world is rapidly moving towards universal literacy and numeracy. In fact, text and arithmetic notation shape the relationship between formal finance and about a billion of the world's poorest adults. This "oral" population, stranded outside the reach of formal employment, have neither the capabilities nor the incentives to engage in digital finance as it is currently being offered. Empirical observation of the actual capabilities and incentives of oral adults can offer transformative solutions for mobile wallet providers, NGO projects, designers and governments.

AB  - While grids or matrix questions are a widely used format in PC web surveys, there is no agreement on the format in mobile web surveys. We conducted a two-wave experiment in an opt in panel in Russia, varying the question format (grid format and item-by-item format) and device respondents used for survey completion (smartphone and PC). The 1,678 respondents completed the survey in the assigned conditions in the first wave and 1,079 in the second wave. Overall, we found somewhat higher measurement error in the grid format in both mobile and PC web conditions. We found almost no significant effect of the question format on test?retest correlations between the latent scores in two waves and no differences in breakoff rates between the question formats. The multigroup comparison showed some measurement equivalence between the question formats. However, the difference varied depending on the length of a scale with a longer scale producing some differences in the measurement equivalence between the conditions. The levels of straightlining were higher in the grid than in the item-by-item format. In addition, concurrent validity was lower in the grid format in both PC and mobile web conditions. Finally, subjective indicators of respondent burden showed that the grid format increased reported technical difficulties and decreased subjective evaluation of the survey.

AB  - The considerable growth in the number of smart mobile devices with a fast Internet connection provides new challenges for survey researchers. In this article, I compare the data quality between two survey modes: self-administered web surveys conducted via personal computer and those conducted via mobile phones. Data quality is compared based on five indicators: (a) completion rates, (b) response order effects, (c) social desirability, (d) non-substantive responses, and (e) length of open answers. I hypothesized that mobile web surveys would result in lower completion rates, stronger response order effects, and less elaborate answers to open-ended questions. No difference was expected in the level of reporting in sensitive items and in the rate of non-substantive responses. To test the assumptions, an experiment with two survey modes was conducted using a volunteer online access panel in Russia. As expected, mobile web was associated with a lower completion rate, shorter length of open answers, and similar level of socially undesirable and non-substantive responses. However, no stronger primacy effects in mobile web survey mode were found.

AB  - There is some evidence that a scrolling design may reduce breakoffs in mobile web surveys compared to a paging design, but there is little empirical evidence to guide the choice of the optimal number of items per page. We investigate the effect of the number of items presented on a page on data quality in two types of questionnaires: with or without user-controlled skips. Three versions of a 30-item instrument were compared, with 5, 15, or all 30 questions presented on a page, in two different surveys, one with skips and one without. We found that displaying 30 items on a page reduced the breakoff rate by almost one-third compared to presenting five items per page in the questionnaire without skips, but the difference was not statistically significant. In both surveys with and without skips, the completion times were significantly lower in the 30-item per page condition; however, item nonresponse rates were also higher. We give some practical recommendations to guide choices while designing questionnaires for mobile web surveys. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

First, the experiment is based on a sample of frequent mobile web users, and the results could be different from a sample of those who use mobile internet less frequently. Second, the experiment is based on a volunteer online access panel and the results could be different in a representative online panel. Third, we tested the differential incentives starting with incentives 50% higher than typical incentives. We suggest that it is worth exploring the effect of other incentives (e.g. 20% or 30% higher). Finally, we suggest that it is worth exploring the difference in participation rates between the conditions in which higher-than-typical incentives would be offered for all participants and when offered only for using a particular device.

AB  - A large number of findings in survey research suggest that responses to sensitive questions are situational and can vary in relation to context. The methodological literature demonstrates that social desirability biases are less prevalent in self-administered surveys, particularly in Web surveys, when there is no interviewer and less risk of presenting oneself in an unfavorable light. Since there is a growing number of users of mobile Web browsers, we focused our study on the effects of different devices (PC or cell phone) in Web surveys on the respondents' willingness to report sensitive information. To reduce selection bias, we carried out a two-wave cross-over experiment using a volunteer online access-panel in Russia. Participants were asked to complete the questionnaire in both survey modes: PC and mobile Web survey. We hypothesized that features of mobile Web usage may affect response accuracy and lead to more socially desirable responses compared to the PC Web survey mode. We found significant differences in the reporting of alcohol consumption by mode, consistent with our hypothesis. But other sensitive questions did not show similar effects. We also found that the presence of familiar bystanders had an impact on the responses, while the presence of strangers did not have any significant effect in either survey mode. Contrary to expectations, we did not find evidence of a positive impact of completing the questionnaire at home and trust in data confidentiality on the level of reporting. These results could help survey practitioners to design and improve data quality in Web surveys completed on different devices.

AB  - We perform a detailed survey and analysis of the most significant attacks, which have targeted industrial control systems over the past decade, based on detailed incident reports from scientific and non-traditional resources. This work is the first that considers together a comprehensive set of real-world cyber-attacks with the purpose of deriving a set of common features focusing particularly on the process control network. Each attack is decomposed to provide a comprehensive overview followed by a discussion of the commonalities identified across attacks. To achieve this, each attack is modelled using Attack Trees with Sequential AND, and mapped to the industrial control system Cyber Kill Chain. We focus on the methods of intrusion rather than the identification of actors. This article can be read in two parts: first, an analysis of each attack, and secondly a discussion of the derived commonalities. The resulting commonalities can be used to develop improved detection strategies to detect modern adversarial techniques and tactics.

AB  - Context: Previous research has indicated that despite awareness of the current literature on the recommended prevention and care of exertional heat stroke (EHS), certified athletic trainers (ATs) acknowledge failure to follow those recommendations. Objective: To investigate the current knowledge, attitudes, and practices of ATs regarding the recognition and treatment of EHS. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Online survey. Patients or Other Participants: We obtained a random sample of e-mail addresses for 1000 high school and collegiate ATs and contacted these individuals with invitations to participate. A total of 498 usable responses were received, for a 25% response rate. Main Outcome Measure(s): The survey instrument evaluated ATs' knowledge and actual practice regarding EHS and included 29 closed-ended Likert scale questions (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree), 2 closed-ended questions rated on a Likert scale (1 = lowest value, 9 = greatest value), 8 open-ended questions, and 7 demographic questions. We focused on the open-ended and demographic questions. Results: Although most ATs (77.1%) have read the current National Athletic Trainers' Association position statement on heat illness, only 18.6% used rectal thermometers to assess core body temperature to recognize EHS, and 49.7% used cold-water immersion to treat EHS. Athletic trainers perceived rectal thermometers as the most valid temperature assessment device when compared with other assessment devices (P ≤ .05), but they used oral thermometers as the primary assessment tool (49.1%). They identified cold-water immersion as the best cooling method (P ≤ .05), even though they used other means to cool a majority of the time (50.3%). Conclusions: The ATs surveyed have sound knowledge of the correct means of EHS recognition and treatment. However, a significant portion of these ATs reported using temperature assessment devices that are invalid with athletes exercising in the heat. Furthermore, they reported using cooling treatment methods that have inferior cooling rates. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background and Objectives: The home literacy environment has been identified as a key predictor of children’s language, school readiness, academic achievement, and behavioral outcomes. With the increased accessibility and consumption of digital media, it is important to understand whether screen use impacts off-line enrichment activities such as reading or whether reading activities offset screen use. Using a prospective birth cohort, we examined reading and screen use at 24, 36, and 60 months to elucidate the directional association between screen use and reading over time. Methods: This study included data from 2440 mothers and children in Calgary, Alberta, drawn from the All Our Families cohort. Children’s screen use and reading activities were assessed via maternal report at age 24, 36, and 60 months. Sociodemographic covariates were also collected. Results: Using a random-intercepts cross-lagged panel model, which statistically controls for individual-level confounds, this study revealed that greater screen use at 24 months was associated with lower reading at 36 months (β = 2.08; 95% confidence interval: 20.13 to 20.02). In turn, lower reading at 36 months was associated with greater screen use at 60 months (β = 2.11; 95% confidence interval: 20.19 to 20.02). Covariates did not modify the associations. Conclusions: A reciprocal relationship between screen use and reading was identified. Early screen use was associated with lower reading activities, resulting in greater screen use at later ages. Findings emphasize the need for practitioners and educators to discuss screen use guidelines and encourage families to engage in device-free activities to foster early literacy exposure.

AB  - Large individual differences characterize maternal postpartum sleep and adjustment. Our goal was to explore aspects of mothers’ nocturnal environments and behaviours that may explain differences in postpartum adjustment. A total of 201 mothers of infants aged 0–6 months completed an online survey with demographics, number and duration of nocturnal awakenings, caretaking behaviours, environment and nocturnal activities during ‘one typical night during the past week’. Mothers reported 2.9 [standard deviation (SD) ± 1.7] nocturnal awakenings, each lasting 33.9 (SD ± 22.5) min. Infant age was related inversely to duration but unrelated to number of awakenings. Falling asleep while feeding was less frequent among exclusively formula‐feeders. Among the entire sample, mothers used a cellphone (59%), backlit tablet (25%), TV (20%) and computer (16%) during nocturnal awakenings. Watching TV and using a computer were each associated with longer nocturnal awakenings. Eighty‐nine per cent of women used ≥ 1 extra light source during nocturnal awakenings: night light (35%), light from a cracked door (28%), desk lamp (25%), electronic device (19%) or room light (14%). Light source(s) was unrelated to number or duration of nocturnal awakenings. These data suggest that, although supplemental light sources were not associated with awakenings, TV and computer use accounted for longer awakenings. Feeding method and technology use may help to explain individual differences in postpartum adjustments and may be targets for more effective interventions.

AB  - This article reviews the existing literature on the collection of paradata in web surveys and extends the research in this area beyond the commonly studied measurement error problem to paradata that can be collected for managing and mitigating other important sources of error. To do so, and in keeping with the nature of paradata as process-oriented, we develop a typology of web survey paradata that incorporates information from all steps in the web survey process. We first define web survey paradata and describe general phases of paradata that run parallel to the steps in fielding a typical web survey. Within each phase, we enumerate several errors within the total survey error paradigm that can be examined with paradata, discussing case studies and motivating examples that illustrate innovative uses of paradata across the web survey process. We conclude with a discussion of open questions and opportunities for further work in this area. Overall, we develop this typology keeping technological advancements at the center of our discussion, but with flexibility to continuously incorporate new developments and trends in both technology and study design. Our typology encourages researchers to think about paradata as tools that can be used to investigate a broader range of outcomes than previously studied.

AB  - This study was done in preparation for the launch of the National Children’s Study (NCS) main study. The goal of this study was to examine the feasibility (completion rates and completeness of data), acceptability, staff time and cost-effectiveness of three methods of data collection for the postnatal 3- and 9-month questionnaires completed as part of NCS protocol. Eligible NCS participants who were scheduled to complete a postnatal questionnaire at three and nine months were randomly assigned to receive either: (a) telephone data collection (b) web-based data collection, or (c) self-administered (mailed) questionnaires. Event completion rates and satisfaction across the three data collection methods were compared and the influence of socio-demographic factors on completion rates and satisfaction rates was examined. Cost data were compared to data for completion and satisfaction for each of the delivery methods. Completion rates and satisfaction did not differ significantly by method, but completeness of data did, with odds of data completeness higher among web than phone (p < 0.001) or mail (p < 0.001). Costs were highest for the phone, followed by mail and web methods (p < 0.001). No significant differences in participant time (i.e. burden) across the three data collection methods were seen. Mail and phone data collection were the least complete of the three methods and were the most expensive. Mailed data collection was neither complete nor exceptionally economical. Web-based data collection was the least costly and provided the most complete data. Participants without web access could complete the questionnaire over the phone.

AB  - The landscape of couple leisure time has shifted to include and, in some relationships, rely upon technology use. Technology has the potential to intrude upon face-to-face interactions and quality time together - i.e., technoference, phubbing. However, it is also likely that couples engage in shared technology use, which could lead to bonding. In the current work, we examined one's own, one's partner's, and shared technology use during couple time across 10 days and the potential impacts on couple-time satisfaction, conflict, and relationship quality. We utilized data from 145 couples who completed a baseline online survey and 10 days of daily online surveys concerning leisure time spent together with their partner and their technology use. Multilevel mediational modeling revealed within-person associations between own and partner technology use with daily leisure satisfaction and leisure conflict. Small, but significant within-person indirect effects on daily relationship quality through leisure satisfaction and conflict were also found for own and partner technology use. In other words, results implied a pathway where technology use impacts one's satisfaction with and conflict during time spent together, and then this (dis) satisfaction and conflict impacts daily relationship quality. Although shared technology use was also a significant predictor, its effects were not robust.

AB  - Online research methodologies may serve as an important mechanism for population-focused data collection in social work research. Online surveys have become increasingly prevalent in research inquiries with young people and have been acknowledged for their potential in investigating understudied and marginalized populations and subpopulations, permitting increased access to communities that tend to be less visible- and thus often less studied-in offline contexts. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) young people are a socially stigmatized, yet digitally active, youth population whose participation in online surveys has been previously addressed in the literature. Many of the opportunities and challenges of online survey research identified with LGBTQ youths may be highly relevant to other populations of marginalized and hard-to-access young people, who are likely present in significant numbers in the online environment (for example, ethnoracialized youths and low-income youths). In this article, the utility of online survey methods with marginalized young people is discussed, and recommendations for social work research are provided.

AB  - Objective: Half of US children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have attempted to elope from adult supervision at least once, elevating their risk for serious injury/death. This study aimed to assess, in a sample of children with ASD aged 4 to 18 years who had previously wandered, whether electronic tracking device (ETD) use is associated with changes in the elopement behavior and household quality of life (QOL). Methods: An anonymous, online questionnaire assessing elopement interventions, elopement behavior, household QOL, attitudes toward ETDs, and sociodemographics was distributed via US autism-related organizations to caregivers of children with ASD. Differences in retrospective estimates of elopement behavior and household QOL before ETD use and during ETD use were evaluated using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Results: A total of 2563 participants completed the questionnaire; 1459 participants met the inclusion criteria. For the current (n = 361) and past (n = 96) ETD users, ETD use was associated with decreased frequency and duration of elopement and decreased risk for serious injury because of elopement (allp< 0.001). ETD use was similarly associated with improvements across all 5 measures of QOL. Among the past ETD users, reasons for discontinuation included device discomfort/fit (33.3%), burden of use (27.1%), and financial cost (14.6%). Among the non-ETD users (n = 1002), common barriers to ETD use were cost (47.5%) and lack of awareness of ETD technology (18.8%). Conclusion: Electronic tracking devices represent a promising technology to help safeguard the well-being of children with ASD while reducing the emotional toll that elopement imposes on families. Cost concerns, burden of use, and lack of awareness seem to limit the widespread adoption of ETDs.

AB  - This paper furthers our understanding of online customer support with regard to online live chat systems. Online live chat systems allow customers to seek service related information from an organisation via online-based synchronous media with a human service representative who provides answers through such media. With use of a web-based survey involving 302 respondents of real-life live chat service experiences with mobile phone network providers in the UK and through the use of structural equation modelling, the aim of this research is to understand the variables capable of influencing a customer's satisfaction with their experience during an online live chat service encounter. The results indicate the importance of service quality, information quality and system quality variables influencing satisfaction with the experience, while such influence is dependent on the purpose of use. Additionally, the results outline the role of emoticons, presence of service reps picture, automated ‘canned’ responses and the presence of response time estimations in moderating the influence of service quality, information quality and system quality variables on satisfaction with the experience.

AB  - Objective: This pilot study explored the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a therapist-facilitated telecare cognitive behavioural anxiety program delivered through schools to children within rural communities. Method: Sixteen children aged 9-12 years (82.5% male), with a principal diagnosis of an anxiety disorder, and their mothers participated in the pilot study. The treatment program was an adaption of the Cool Kids Child and Adolescent Anxiety Management Program. Treatment was delivered by clinical psychologists and involved 10 weekly sessions with children via an interactive, real-time videoconferencing online platform at their school. Parents also received 4 phone calls during the treatment program. Outcome measures included clinician-rated diagnostic status and child- and parent-reported symptoms and interference. Results: According to combined parent and child reports, 62.5% of children no longer met diagnostic criteria for their primary anxiety disorder, and 31.25% did not meet diagnostic criteria for any anxiety disorder post-treatment. Results indicated that the severity of anxiety symptoms, functional impact of anxiety symptoms, externalising difficulties, and depressive symptoms in children decreased significantly post-treatment, as reported by both parents and children. Conclusions: A telecare model of therapy could be a feasible and effective way of delivering evidence-based intervention to children in rural communities.

AB  - Background:Advanced technology and improved outcomes have led to rapid growth of ventricular assist devices (VADs) throughout the world, but little exists regarding their structure. We sought to study trends in VAD programs on a global level.Methods:We distributed a 26-question online survey to 321 individuals who work within those programs. Four categories of questions were formed: patient management, coordinator role, multidisciplinary support, and leadership.Results:Fifty-eight surveys (47 United States, 11 international) were analyzed. The majority of programs cared for 26 to 100 device-assisted patients (62%), 26% cared for ≤25 patients, and 12% cared for ≥100 patients. Advanced practice providers (APPs) were used in 69% of programs as a device coordinator. In-hospital rounding was performed equally among the APPs and registered nurses. Most programs used a social worker (90%), nutritionist (74%), pharmacist (72%), palliative care (66%), and finance coordinator (64%). Less than half (43%) included a case manager and only 33% used a pharmacist. The program leader was identified as a cardiologist (31%) or surgeon (26%) or both equally (43%).Conclusion:This study demonstrates differences and similarities between VAD program structures. Additional research is warranted to evaluate the effect of program structure on outcomes, job satisfaction, and retention regions.

AB  - Recording points of interest using GPS whilst working in the field is an established technique in geographical fieldwork, where the user's current position is used as the spatial reference to be captured; this is known as geo-tagging. We outline the development and evaluation of a smartphone application called Zapp that enables geo-tagging of any distant point on the visible landscape. The ability of users to log or retrieve information relating to what they can see, rather than where they are standing, allows them to record observations of points in the broader landscape scene, or to access descriptions of landscape features from any viewpoint. The application uses the compass orientation and tilt of the phone to provide data for a line of sight algorithm that intersects with a Digital Surface Model stored on the mobile device. We describe the development process and design decisions for Zapp present the results of a controlled study of the accuracy of the application, and report on the use of Zapp for a student field exercise. The studies indicate the feasibility of the approach, but also how the appropriate use of such techniques will be constrained by current levels of precision in mobile sensor technology. The broader implications for interactive query of the distant landscape and for remote data logging are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study explored the social repercussions of preadolescents' mobile device use within the family context by testing two opposing predictions regarding the impact of technology on the quality of interpersonal relationships. Specifically, we examined whether smartphone and tablet use was positively related to preadolescents' self-disclosure to their parents and/or displaced family time, which we hypothesized to be related to children's satisfaction with family life. Results of a cross-sectional survey (n=698, 49.6% girls, Mage= 10.9, SD = 0.69) provided support for both hypotheses, thus corroborating the presence of at least two diverging pathways that underlie this relationship. Although mobile device use seemed to foster a context that supported children's self-disclosure to their parents, results also indicated a negative and indirect association through children's perceived family time. This negative pathway, however, did not hold when social use among children and parents (e.g., playing games together online) was considered separately.

AB  - Developmental dysgraphia, being observed among 10-30% of school-aged children, is a disturbance or difficulty in the production of written language that has to do with the mechanics of writing. The objective of this study is to propose a method that can be used for automated diagnosis of this disorder, as well as for estimation of difficulty level as determined by the handwriting proficiency screening questionnaire. We used a digitizing tablet to acquire handwriting and consequently employed a complex parameterization in order to quantify its kinematic aspects and hidden complexities. We also introduced a simple intrawriter normalization that increased dysgraphia discrimination and HPSQ estimation accuracies. Using a random forest classifier, we reached 96% sensitivity and specificity, while in the case of automated rating by the HPSQ total score, we reached 10% estimation error. This study proves that digital parameterization of pressure and altitude/tilt patterns in children with dysgraphia can be used for preliminary diagnosis of this writing disorder.

AB  - One of my intentions in putting together the roundtable discussion From the Page to the Screen to Augmented Reality: New Modes of Language-Driven Technology-Mediated Research at Kingston University in July 2010 was to give the opportunity to research practitioners to perform their projects or present their work, with the aim of stimulating discussion on practice-led research in this field and instigating possibilities for further collaborations. I performed Connected Memories, an interactive generative narrative, which I produced especially after the proposal had been selected to be presented at the panel in Interactive Storytelling and Memory Building in Post-conflict Society for the International Symposium on Electronic Art (ISEA 2009). I invited José Carlos Silvestre to develop the technical side of the work. Silvestre is a New Media artist and writer, interested in 'how code can signify by means of its native strategies'. It was a very rewarding collaboration, and he needs to be acknowledged for his knowledgeable programming input. The project was performed later in the same year at Landmark, Kunsthall Bergen, Norway as part of the event 'Network as Space and Medium for collaborative Interdisciplinary Art Practice' organized by the Linguistic Literary and Aesthetics Studies (LLE) Digital Culture group at the University of Bergen. I chose to present it again at the roundtable discussion to question, through practice as research; notions of meaning production in digital textuality; the double view of linguistic signifiers and visual-language abstract landscapes; the use of technology as a device to collect and share stories; the programming of non-linear interactive narrative structures and storytelling through the performance of the work; and the use of code to perform generative textualities. These themes will be reviewed in this article by presenting the motivations behind the work, concepts, context, research process and technological concerns. My overall research draws from concrete, visual and experimental poetics, art, linguistics and new media art, as does this work. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Videos are often used in web surveys to assess attitudes. While including videos may allow researchers to test immediate reactions, there may be issues associated with displaying videos that are overlooked. In this article, we examine the effects of using video stimuli on responses in a probability-based web survey. Specifically, we evaluate the association between demographics, mobile device usage, and the ability to view videos; differences in ad recall based on whether respondents saw a video or still images of the video; whether respondents? complete viewing of videos is related to presentation order; and the data quality of follow-up questions to the videos as a function of presentation order and complete viewing. Overall, we found that respondents using mobile browsers were less likely to be able to view videos in the survey. Those who could view videos were more likely to indicate recall compared to those who viewed images, and videos that were shown later in the survey were viewed in their entirety less frequently than those shown earlier. These results directly pertain to the legitimacy of using videos in web surveys to gather data about attitudes.

AB  - Abstract Workforce mobility and diversity are now the reality for many businesses, requiring employers to facilitate their employees’ acquisition of foreign languages (FLs). Developing communicative competencies in an FL is necessary to fulfill the demands of an international workplace. Increasingly, companies have done so with the support of commercial apps and virtual-classroom systems. An example is the language learning company Babbel, which provides corporate clients with the package ‘Babbel Intensive.’ This package comprises app subscription as well as virtual-classroom credits, both aiming to improve spoken competence in an FL. The present study investigated learners’ perceptions of workplace communication in an FL and the impact of Babbel Intensive on their skills. Moreover, the study examined beliefs Babbel Intensive users hold about language learning, as well as the types of motivation they exhibit. We followed a sequential mixed-method research design, comprising explorative qualitative in-depth interviews with 7 users and a subsequent survey with 52 users. Our findings show that learners use the FL learned with the Babbel Intensive package for email exchanges as well as conversations with business partners. The main challenges they experience revolve around vocabulary, grammar, and speaking skills. Babbel Intensive is regarded as exerting a positive impact upon these difficulties, especially through the personalization of classes. In terms of learner beliefs, users highlight that online learning can be associated with struggle but also with personal development and flexibility. Moreover, learners are shown to have varying types of motivation, primarily categorizable as extrinsic motivation. Our findings highlight the affordances and constraints of virtual-classroom solutions to workplace communication in an FL from the point of view of the mobile and diverse workforce of international companies.

AB  - As an over-the-top (OTT) and non-subscription-based video-on-demand media service, mobile short-form video application (e.g., TikTok or Douyin) is a free video-sharing social networking service (SNS) distributing short-form video content to smartphones, smart TVs, and tablets. This study investigates the roles of gratifications-sought, narcissism, and personality traits in TikTok engagement behaviors (i.e., contribution, enhancement, and creation) in China. Data were gathered from a sample of 526 TikTok users through an online questionnaire survey in 2020. Factor analysis confirmed nine gratifications sought: escape, fashion, entertainment, information seeking, money making, sociability seeking, navigability, modality, and interactivity. In particular, extraverts and people with the quality of being vain were most active in the contributing, enhancing, and creating TikTok engagement behaviors. The results also show that exhibitionists and people who are more open to new experiences were found to create more, while narcissists with an attitude of entitlement also engaging strongly in giving likes, commenting, forwarding TikToks, and following others. Theoretical and practical implications are also discussed. • Explored how gratifications-sought, narcissism, and personality traits influence use intensity and usage patterns of TikTok. • Interactivity, modality, navigability, entertainment, entitlement in narcissism, and age were related to TikTok use. • Extraverts and those to be vain were most active in the contribution, enhancement, and creation functions. • Exhibitionists and people who are more open to new experiences would engage more. • Narcissists with an attitude of entitlement reacted strongly in giving likes, commenting, forwarding, and following others.

AB  - There is little research examining the confluence of what communication channel is used for which purpose with which person. This study examines the 'setting' for communication that includes what is communicated (e.g. positive or negative messages), the nature of the relationship (close versus distant), and the information channel. The respondents to a web-based questionnaire (n = 627) were Norwegian smartphone users aged 16–35 years. Respondents evaluated mobile communication services that they used in specific social settings by 'checking off' all that apply. Two methods of analysis are used to examine the material. First, a Principal Component Regression validated the main method, namely a mixed model for the Analysis of Variance. Results show the probability of using a mobile communication service is based on the effects of social group, communication purpose, communication channel, and their interaction. The relationship to the interlocutor was found to have the strongest effect on channel choice. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - While iPads and other mobile devices are gaining popularity in educational settings, challenges associated with teachers’ use of technology continue to hold true. Preparing preservice teachers within teacher preparation programs to gain experience learning and teaching science using mobile technologies is critical for them to develop positive beliefs and self-efficacy for future technology integration. The purpose of this study was to investigate changes in preservice elementary teachers’ technology self-efficacy during their participation in a specialized science content course that utilized a mobile technology-based physics curriculum, Exploring Physics. The Exploring Physics curriculum is available as a hybrid online-offline application running on multiple platforms (iOS, Android, PC/Mac). Participants included 34 preservice elementary teachers who participated in pre- and post-implementation of a technology self-efficacy survey. Data sources also included two focus-group and individual interviews with six participants, weekly classroom observations, and artifacts. Results showed significant positive changes in participants’ technology self-efficacy regarding the use of mobile technologies in science teaching. Factors that supported participants’ technology self-efficacy included: (a) firsthand experiences with iPads, (b) enhanced science content understandings, (c) high interactivity and engagement, and (c) instructor modeling the use of technology. Findings have implications for preservice teacher preparation for technology integration in science teaching. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study aimed to test the possible moderating role of parents’ emotional stability on the relationship between parent distraction with technology and child social competence during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data used in the study were collected in May 2020 when extensive restrictive measures, labeled as lockdown, were present in Croatia. Data on technoference in parenting, parents’ problematic phone tendencies, and child social competence were collected using an online questionnaire from parents (n = 281) of children aged 3 to 14 years. The results show a significant negative effect of overall technoference in parenting on child social competence. This negative effect was significantly moderated by parents’ emotional stability, as expected. Medium and high levels of parents’ emotional stability buffer the negative effect of low technoference in parenting on child social competence. Results imply technoference in parenting negatively affects child development, but the emotional stability of parents can be a protective factor.

AB  - As online communication is more and more integrated in everyday life to support and maintain existing social ties, this study examined the factors associated with preference of face to face, phone or online conversations. A contextual framework that emphasizes the role of relationship origin, relationship intensity and content of communication on communication channel choice among adolescents was empirically tested. Based on a nationwide survey in Israel, it was found that communication content, relationship origin and place of residence affect the preference of face to face and online communication. Phone communication appears to be a more non specific channel to conduct personal and non personal conversations and relationship origin did not affect its use. These findings suggest that relationship origin is important, and face to face communication is preferred for ties that were initiated face to face and online communication for ties that were initiated online. For this sample of regular population, there is no indication that online communication tends to be personal or hyper personal. The use of all the communication channels is preferred to the maintenance of existing ties and is less used for the creation of new ties. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - A great deal of research effort has been put in exploring crossmodal correspondences in the field of cognitive science which refer to the systematic associations frequently made between different sensory modalities (e.g. high pitch is matched with angular shapes). However, the possibilities cross-modality opens in the digital world have been relatively unexplored. Therefore, we consider that studying the plasticity and the effects of crossmodal correspondences in a mulsemedia setup can bring novel insights about improving the human-computer dialogue and experience. Mulsemedia refers to the combination of three or more senses to create immersive experiences. In our experiments, users were shown six video clips associated with certain visual features based on color, brightness, and shape. We examined if the pairing with crossmodal matching sound and the corresponding auto-generated haptic effect, and smell would lead to an enhanced user QoE. For this, we used an eye-tracking device as well as a heart rate monitor wristband to capture users' eye gaze and heart rate whilst they were experiencing mulsemedia. After each video clip, we asked the users to complete an on-screen questionnaire with a set of questions related to smell, sound and haptic effects targeting their enjoyment and perception of the experiment. Accordingly, the eye gaze and heart rate results showed significant influence of the cross-modally mapped multisensorial effects on the users' QoE. Our results highlight that when the olfactory content is crossmodally congruent with the visual content, the visual attention of the users seems shifted towards the correspondent visual feature. Crosmodally matched media is also shown to result in an enhanced QoE compared to a video only condition.

AB  - An increased interest in the notion of place has evolved in interaction design based on the proliferation of wireless infrastructures, developments in digital media, and a 'spatial turn' in computing. In this article, place-specific computing is suggested as a genre of interaction design that addresses the shaping of interactions among people, place-specific resources and global socio-technical networks, mediated by digital technology, and influenced by the structuring conditions of place. The theoretical grounding for place-specific computing is located in the meeting between conceptions of place in human geography and recent research in interaction design focusing on embodied interaction. Central themes in this grounding revolve around place and its relation to embodiment and practice, as well as the social, cultural and material aspects conditioning the enactment of place. Selected examples of place-specific computing are presented from a series of pilot studies, conducted in close collaboration with design students in Malmo, Berlin, Cape Town and Rome, that generated 36 design concepts in the genre. Reflecting on these examples, issues in the design of place-specific computing are discussed, as well as questions for further research concerning how digitally mediated interactions can be understood as elements of practiced place.

AB  - The practice of reading is rapidly moving from print to screen. Young children are not immune from this trend; indeed, many children's principal literacy experiences occur using iPads and other handheld digital devices. This transition raises important questions about how the emergence and development of literacy might change in these new environments. This paper reviews research to date on e-reading, both in the pre-tablet and tablet era, within the context of what we know more generally about literacy development. We then propose topics for future research and discuss methodological issues related to the investigation of these topics. Our goal is to spark further discussion about how to study young children's literacy development in the emerging e-reading era. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This paper introduces a new perspective on information behavior in Web 2.0 environments, including the role of mobile access in bridging formal to informal learning. Kuhlthau’s (1991, 2007) Information Search Process (ISP) model is identified as a theoretical basis for exploring Information Seeking attitudes and behaviors, while social learning and literacy concepts of Vygotsky (1962, 1978), Bruner (1962, 1964) and Jenkins (2010) are identified as foundations for Information Sharing. The Guided Inquiry Spaces model (Maniotes, 2005) is proposed as an approach to bridging the student’s informal learning world and the curriculum-based teacher’s world. Research within this framework is operationalized through a recently validated Information and Communications Technology Learning (ICTL) survey instrument measuring learners’ preferences for self-expression, sharing, and knowledge acquisition interactions in technology-pervasive environments. Stepwise refinement of ICTL produced two reliable and valid psychometric scales, Information Sharing (alpha = .77) and Information Seeking (alpha = .72). Cross-validation with an established Mobile Learning Scale (Khaddage & Knezek, 2013) indicates that Information Sharing aligns significantly (p < .05) with Mobile Learning. Information Seeking, Information Sharing, and mobile access are presented as important, complimentary components important, complimentary components in the shift along the formal to informal learning continuum. Therefore, measures of these constructs can assist in understanding students’ preferences for 21st century learning. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Innovators and entrepreneurs developing products and competing "on top" of digital platforms face different conditions than do those in more traditional industries. In this paper, we explore how this affects appropriability strategies in novel data on mobile app developers' appropriability strategies. We find that the many smallest developers in the "long tail"- the vast majority of all developers - do in fact take actions to capture value and to protect their intellectual property, but do so only through informal mechanisms. By contrast, larger developers exploit a combination of both informal mechanisms and formal intellectual property rights, using copyright, patents, and trademarks. Several strategies particular to digital platforms are also documented. We link this pattern of different strategies pursued by different competitor types to the structural features of digital competition.

AB  - Zielsetzung: Es ist vorgeschlagen worden, dass der nächste große Fortschritt in der Hörgerätetechnologie (HA) kognitives Feedback vom Benutzer zur Steuerung der HA-Funktionalität beinhalten muss. Um automatische hirnwellengesteuerte HA-Anpassungen zu ermöglichen, müssen die Aufmerksamkeitsprozesse, die der Sprach-Lärm-Wahrnehmung bei hörgeschädigten Personen zugrunde liegen, besser verstanden werden. Hier haben wir uns mit dem Einfluss zweier wichtiger Faktoren für die Hörleistung von HA-Trägern, der Hörgeräteverarbeitung und der Motivation, befasst, indem wir die laufenden neuronalen Reaktionen während des langfristigen Hörens kontinuierlicher geräuschvoller Sprache analysierten. Die Methoden: Sechzehn normalhörende (NH) und 15 linear hörgeschädigte (aHI) Teilnehmer hörten eine Hörbuchaufnahme, eingebettet in realistische Sprachlappergeräusche bei individuell angepassten Signal-Rausch-Abständen (SNRs). Ein HA-Simulator wurde sowohl für die Simulation einer Richtmikrofoneinstellung als auch für die individuelle Verstärkung verwendet. Um das Hörverhalten beurteilen zu können, beantworteten die Teilnehmer Fragen zum Inhalt des Hörbuchs. Wir manipulierten (1) die Motivation der Teilnehmer, indem wir in einer Hälfte der Messungen eine monetäre Belohnung für gute Hörleistung anboten, und (2) das SNR, indem wir die Einstellung des Richtmikrofons ein- und ausschalteten. Während der Speech-in-Noise-Aufgabe wurden Elektroenzephalographie-Signale (EEG) mit drahtloser, mobiler Hardware aufgezeichnet. EEG-Korrelate der Hörleistung wurden mit Hilfe von EEG-Impulsantworten untersucht, die anhand der Kreuzkorrelation zwischen dem aufgezeichneten EEG-Signal und der zeitlichen Einhüllenden des Hörbuchs am Ausgang des HA-Simulators geschätzt wurden. Ergebnisse: Auf der Verhaltensebene beobachteten wir bei den NH-Hörern eine bessere Leistung als bei den aHI-Hörern. Darüber hinaus führte die Einstellung des Richtmikrofons zu einer besseren Leistung für beide Teilnehmergruppen, und wenn die Einstellung des Richtmikrofons ausgeschaltet wurde, verbesserte sich die Motivation auch die Leistung der aHI-Teilnehmer. Die Analyse der EEG-Impulsantworten zeigte schnellere N1-P2-Reaktionen für beide Gruppen und grössere N2-Spitzenamplituden für die aHI-Gruppe, wenn die Richtmikrofoneinstellung aktiviert war, aber keine physiologischen Korrelationen der Motivation. Die Bedeutung: Die Ergebnisse dieser Studie weisen darauf hin, dass die Motivation eine wichtige Rolle für das Sprachverstehen im Lärm spielt. In Bezug auf neuro-gesteuerte HAs deuten unsere Ergebnisse darauf hin, dass die Latenz der Aufmerksamkeitsprozesse durch HA-induzierte Reizveränderungen beeinflusst wird, was potenziell genutzt werden kann, um einen Nutzen aus der automatischen Geräuschunterdrückungsverarbeitung abzuleiten. Weitere Forschung ist notwendig, um die neuronalen Korrelate der Motivation als exklusiven Top-down-Prozess zu identifizieren und solche Merkmale mit HA-getriebenen für Online-HA-Anpassungen zu kombinieren.

AB  - Background: The European beech is arguably the most important climax broad-leaved tree species in Central Europe, widely planted for its valuable wood. Here, we report the 542 Mb draft genome sequence of an up to 300-year-old individual (Bhaga) from an undisturbed stand in the Kellerwald-Edersee National Park in central Germany. Findings: Using a hybrid assembly approach, Illumina reads with short- and long-insert libraries, coupled with long Pacific Biosciences reads, we obtained an assembled genome size of 542 Mb, in line with flow cytometric genome size estimation. The largest scaffold was of 1.15 Mb, the N50 length was 145 kb, and the L50 count was 983. The assembly contained 0.12% of Ns. A Benchmarking with Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) analysis retrieved 94% complete BUSCO genes, well in the range of other high-quality draft genomes of trees. A total of 62,012 protein-coding genes were predicted, assisted by transcriptome sequencing. In addition, we are reporting an efficient method for extracting high-molecular-weight DNA from dormant buds, by which contamination by environmental bacteria and fungi was kept at a minimum. Conclusions: The assembled genome will be a valuable resource and reference for future population genomics studies on the evolution and past climate change adaptation of beech and will be helpful for identifying genes, e.g., involved in drought tolerance, in order to select and breed individuals to adapt forestry to climate change in Europe. A continuously updated genome browser and download page can be accessed from beechgenome.net, which will include future genome versions of the reference individual Bhaga, as new sequencing approaches develop.

AB  - Recent advances in mobile technology offer new directions for augmentative and alternative communication (AAC); however, it remains unclear whether they meet the needs of individuals with aphasia. This paper reports on research seeking to understand this changing landscape. A Web-based survey of aphasia-oriented clinicians helped illuminate device adoption trends. Observations of group therapy sessions featuring high-tech AAC use and focus groups with the clinicians from those sessions provided further nuance and insight into usage and adoption. It was shown that "smart" mobile devices are garnering acceptance as a promising platform for high-tech AAC; however, contrary to the authors' expectations, these devices are not being paired with mobile versions of traditional picture dictionaries. Rather, clinicians reported appropriating generic applications to complement other (non-high-tech) communication strategies, suggesting new opportunities for design.

AB  - The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of mobile phone on the socio-educational performance of the students in the city of Yazd. In order to do that, we used the theory of uses and gratification which provided a useful theoretical and explanatory tool. One of the axioms on which we can proceed to evaluate these impacts is that the mobile phone usage is one of the modern phenomena of the electronic century and digital world that has positive, negative, social and moral effects on its users. To examine such claims we used a cross sectional study that was done among 579 sample students who lived in city of Yazd as university students in 2012. The data were collected by a validated questionnaire. Based on the research results, it can be argued that although mobile phone may have negative impact on the lives of the youth, especially the students, it also has benefits including it helps them to meet their communication needs and educational needs.

AB  - This study focuses on two inter-related questions: What effect did new media have on the Iranian women’s movement; and what impact did the women’s movement have on the Green Movement. Emergence and significance of new social communication technologies on struggles for social equality. Development of the women's movement in Iran during 100-year politically historically significant period from Constitutional Revolution 1905, world and regional wars to contemporary cyberfeminism, with focus on new media in a critical decade of the women’s movement (2003–2013) and related Green Movement of 2009. During the Iranian women’s movement 100-year history Iranian women contributed actively to major political transitions including the Constitutional Revolution 1905 and Revolution of 1979. Yet efforts to secure equal rights achieved less success. The study examines four decades post-1979 revolution. The first two decades the women’s movement struggled to be heard. The third decade from 1999 the movement gained momentum. Internet, mobile phones and new media created opportunities to organize, build support abroad and mobilize large exile communities. Beginning 2006 worldwide Internet and global communication raised hopes for new effectiveness. The study analyses new media usage by women and civil activists in Iran, impacts, consequences on the women’s movement and interactions with the political Green Movement and related 2009 presidential campaign. The study is structured in 10 chapters: Chapter 1 overview. Chapter 2 social political history of women's movement in Iran struggle for rights. Chapter 3 women’s movement impacts, political approaches, new media, Internet, micro-macro interactions. Chapter 4 pragmatic women's rights and social activists’ use of new media. Chapter 5 social context, political change, resistance. Chapter 6 new media as agent for diversity and pluralism. Chapter 7 Internet as double-edged sword, social political gains, government responses, technological controls. Chapter 8 regional impact in the Middle East. Chapter 9 scientific methods, primary research data, statistical analysis. Chapter 10 conclusions. Primary data includes qualitative interviews with 18 experts in Iran and abroad, including women’s and civil rights activists, journalists, lawyers, political activists, artists, authors and students, regarding new media in the women’s movement in Iran. An online questionnaire with 278 respondents adds empirical quantitative data. Statistical analysis supports findings that the women’s movement shaped the presidential election of 2009 in at least two ways: “policy influence” and “transformational dialogue.” Women’s rights activists evolved use of new media to promote pluralistic voicing of demands in public platforms, to open dialogues for discussion and to promote civil society “tolerance approaches” in contrast to constrained political status quo, factional interests and extremism.

AB  - Modern technology allows for surveying through different media (e.g. Internet, mobile phones, tablets), which may influence the quality of collected data with additional effects due to the survey mode and should be pretested with the purpose of avoiding effects that would deteriorate the quality of collected data. In the present study, we analysed the technological development of surveying tools by testing the applicability of cognitive interviews on several different survey modes. We focused on the importance of the cognitive interviewer and the effect of reducing their degree of involvement on the quality of the interview results. We carried out personal interviews, interviews using voice-over-Internet protocol, interviews using programs for instant messaging, and web-based interviews; these enabled us to analyse the quality of each survey mode and recognize their advantages and deficiencies. Through the comparison of these modes and their assigned technique, we showed that the role of a cognitive interviewer is important for the quality of interviews regardless of the degree of their involvement in the survey process. However, the requirement for the pretesting situation to resemble the actual final process leads to a necessity to develop new, enhanced approaches to cognitive interviewing on trending survey modes.

AB  - With the proliferation of mobile devices and online video services, mobile learning has grown both in popularity and complexity. New challenges include the multitude of mobile devices with different characteristics and limitations, as well as the exponential growth in educational multimedia content. Streaming multimedia content to mobile devices is a resource intensive task that requires significant resources such as network bandwidth, with demand expected to increase beyond future networks capacity as users adopt new technologies such as UHD, AR, VR, 3D and 360-degree video. While a number of adaptive m-learning systems have been previously proposed, none of these have thoroughly addressed the adaptation of educational multimedia content. This article proposes the novel DQAMLearn framework that aims to support mobile learner’s seamless access to educational multimedia content from a variety of mobile devices with different characteristics. Moreover, as mobile users are increasingly becoming quality-aware, the framework integrates novel mechanisms for decreasing the video quality in a controlled way, with the aim to support a good learner quality of experience (QoE) even in resource constrained situations. A comprehensive subjective study was conducted to evaluate the proposed framework. The results showed that the framework enables both high learning achievement from educational multimedia clips, with 12% and 83% correct response rates for pre and post-test questionnaires, respectively, and high learner QoE with a mean video quality rating of 79.19 on a 0–100 acceptability scale.

AB  - Rapid increases in young people's time spent using digital technology ("screen time") in the mobile internet era have led to anxiety about long-term effects. This mixed-method US study examines childhood experiences and contextual factors that shape screen time in the transition to adulthood. We recursively analyzed 56 qualitative interviews with young adults in a large metropolitan area in 2016-2018 and prospective longitudinal nationally representative survey data (PSID-CDS-2007 and PSID-TAS-2017) to articulate a conceptual framework of life course influences on young adults' time spent using digital technologies. Inductive qualitative analyses built an initial framework, which was assessed with quantitative data, then further refined with qualitative analyses. Young adults drew on life course perspectives when discussing influences on their current digital technology use. As they suggested, in quantitative analyses more frequent adolescent technology use and greater device access weakly predicted increased technology frequency. Current school enrollment and several current peer factors predicted technology time. Interviewees emphasized the influence of parenting around technology use during adolescence, but parenting did not predict young adult screen time in quantitative analyses. Further qualitative analyses suggested that instead of influencing current technology time, earlier parenting shaped current emotional responses and imagined future technology use. We found young adults' technology use frequency to be informed by earlier experiences but highly malleable. Past technology use and current social contexts matter, but only up to a point. Moving beyond time use to incorporate emotional responses and future plans can better capture how the life course shapes technology use.

AB  - This article explores technological systems that dissimulate by design. Examples include untrustworthy hotel and workplace thermostats, digital applications to spy on workers and family members, and commercial and law-enforcement systems that surreptitiously collect mobile phone data. Rather than view such cases as exceptional, I argue that deceptive communication systems are hidden articulations of normal technological orders. If deception in itself is not the primary problem with such systems, then transparency alone cannot be the solution. As troubling as institutional opacity might be, an analysis of deceptive systems reveals more fundamental problems: imbalances in power and widespread acquiescence to corporate and state efforts to control individuals, groups, and their data. By moving beyond a quest for (or belief in) technological veracity, scholars could redirect attention to power inequalities and the pressing question of how to live together ethically.

AB  - Dissatisfaction with the traditional model of HCI research borrowed from experimental psychology has lead to a number of interesting new approaches. One is the so-called 'hermeneutic approach' based on field research methods. Another is to apply existing theory from cognitive psychology. This paper is mainly concerned with a third discernible approach based around a study of the artifacts or inventions built to facilitate human-computer interaction. The effectiveness of different system features is explained by reference to the user's task. The investigation of 'observation-invention pairs' is suggested as a way of providing generalisations about user behaviour consistent with this approach. The observation part is a statement about the behaviour of users with some specified generality. The invention serves to illustrate the observation's implications for design and provides a heuristic for further inventions. The paper relates observation-invention pairs to other analyses of artifacts and concludes that they have a place as general statements of knowledge for HCI design. © 1991 Butterworth-Heinemann Ltd.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak forced most of the world's population to be confined at home to prevent contagion. Research reveals that one of the consequences of this confinement for children is an increased amount of time spent using screens (television, computers, and mobile devices, etc.) at home. This exploratory study aims to analyze the association between screen time exposure and emotional/behavioral problems of infants and children aged under 7 years, as manifested during the lockdown period in Portugal due to the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. The study was controlled for sociodemographic and confinement variables. A sample of 193 parents of children aged from 6 months to 6 years and 12 months, residing in Portugal, completed a survey about the time and manner of use of screen time exposure of their children. Data were derived on circumstances both before and after the confinement; the survey also explored the child's behavioral and emotional adjustment. The findings revealed a modest relationship between children's exposure time to screens and behavioral and emotional problems on children studied. It was also found that parents may play an important role in children's behavioral and emotional adjustment during the confinement period.

AB  - First step of the development of an effective safety management system is to create reliable crash databases since the quality of decision making in road safety depends on the quality of the data on which decisions are based. Improving crash data is a worldwide priority, as highlighted in the Global Plan for the Decade of Action for Road Safety adopted by the United Nations, which recognizes that the overall goal of the plan will be attained improving the quality of data collection at the national, regional and global levels.
Crash databases provide the basic information for effective highway safety efforts at any level of government, but lack of uniformity among countries and among the different jurisdictions in the same country is observed. Several existing databases show significant drawbacks which hinder their effective use for safety analysis and improvement. Furthermore, modern technologies offer great potential for significant improvements of existing methods and procedures for crash data collection, processing and analysis. To address these issues, in this paper we present the development and evaluation of a web-based platform independent software for crash data collection, processing and analysis. The software is designed for mobile and desktop electronic devices and enables a guided and automated drafting of the crash report, assisting police officers both on-site and in the office.
The software development was based both on the detailed critical review of existing Australasian, EU, and U.S. crash databases and software as well as on the continuous consultation with the stakeholders. The evaluation was carried out comparing the completeness, timeliness, and accuracy of crash data before and after the use of the software in the city of Vico Equense, in south of Italy showing significant advantages. The amount of collected information increased from 82 variables to 268 variables, i.e., a 227% increase. The time saving was more than one hour per crash, i.e., a 36% reduction. The on-site data collection did not produce time saving, however this is a temporary weakness that will be annihilated very soon in the future after officers are more acquainted with the software. The phase of evaluation, processing and analysis carried out in the office was dramatically shortened, i.e., a 69% reduction. Another benefit was the standardization which allowed fast and consistent data analysis and evaluation. Even if all these benefits are remarkable, the most valuable benefit of the new procedure was the reduction of the police officers mistakes during the manual operations of survey and data evaluation. Because of these benefits, the satisfaction questionnaires administrated to the police officers after the testing phase showed very good acceptance of the procedure. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Despite the significance of studies related to mobile applications, little empirical research has been conducted into the factors that may affect visually impaired people's acceptance and usage of mobile applications. This study investigated how individuals with visual impairment (VI) adopt and use mobile applications (apps) in their daily lives based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology and explored what needs to be considered when developing a mobile app for people with VI. An online survey consisting of close-ended and open-ended questions was administered to a total of 259 participants with VI. Structural equation modeling was used to examine direct and moderated relationships among study variables. Thematic analysis was also conducted to analyze participants' responses to the open-ended questions. The results of the quantitative analysis revealed that the performance expectancy significantly predicted the behavioral intention to use mobile apps, and this relationship was significantly moderated by the attitude toward mobile apps. The qualitative analysis showed that the functionality and accessibility of mobile apps were essential for improving the acceptance and usage of mobile apps for persons with visual impairment. Moreover, future mobile apps need to focus on enhancing specific features in navigation, communication, visual identification, and screen reading. The theoretical and practical implications are further discussed.

AB  - Android 5 informs users of all permissions requested when downloading an app and gives users an all-or-nothing acceptance decision to make for the permissions. In contrast, Android 6 informs users of each permission upon first use of the downloaded app. We conducted an online study with participants recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk to compare the relative usability of the two permissions interfaces. Each interface condition contained a simulation of the Google Play Store and instructed participants to role-play the task of downloading an app. Afterward, each participant was questioned about which permissions were seen and the functions of those permissions. The Android 5 interface showed better performance with informing users as to which permissions access their device, whereas the Android 6 interface fared better with presenting the functions of the permissions. Also, the Android 6 interface was found to be more intuitive to use than that of Android 5. Although a pilot study showed that users favored the Android 6 permissions interface over Android 5’s, the present study found no clear evidence that it was more effective than Android 5.

AB  - Introduction: Multi-site tobacco cessation trials could benefit from remote biochemical verification for tobacco use without invasive, time-consuming, or expensive collection processes. To the authors' knowledge, there have been no previous studies examining the predictive validity of oral fluid swabs for the detection of cotinine levels with samples collected off-site and mailed for on-site interpretation. Methods: Tobacco users were recruited through an online survey and participants who met the initial eligibility criteria were invited to take part. Those who elected to enroll provided two positive iScreen Oral Fluid Device (OFD) cotinine test samples during an in-office visit. One sample was used as a control and stored in a temperature-regulated location, while the other was mailed from one of ten surrounding counties. Mailing method and time from collection to mailing were varied, and results were assessed against control samples. Results: Twenty tobacco users enrolled in the study. Participants ranged in age from 18 to 31 (M = 16.45, SD = 1.54). Several types of tobacco use were reported, with electronic cigarettes the most commonly reported product. None of the mailed sample interpretations changed from pre- to post-mailing, with up to twenty-one days from sample collection to results confirmation. Conclusions: Results indicate that the use of mailed oral swabs may be an easy to use, reliable, and low-cost option for the detection of cotinine in tobacco users when in-person collection is not feasible. Test result interpretations were found to be unchanged after mailing, and after extended post-collection time gaps. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: To evaluate a system—'the service'—designed to improve mobile telephone communication for people with hearing loss. Design: Each participant registered online and took an online hearing test using their own mobile telephone held in the position of their choice. The test assessed the combined effects of the telephone, the hearing loss of the participant and the hearing aid of the participant (if worn). The results were stored as a 'hearing profile' and used to set up frequency-dependent amplification and multichannel amplitude compression. The signal processing was performed in the telephone network and applied to all calls of the participant. Participants completed four questionnaires about their listening experiences using the telephone, one before using the service, two while using the service and one after using the service. Also, the ability to understand speech was measured using challenging sentences. Study sample: Fifty-three participants with varying degrees of hearing loss. Results: The great majority of participants indicated that call clarity was improved and that listening difficulty was reduced when using the service. Speech intelligibility scores were significantly improved when using the service. Conclusions: The service appears to be effective in improving phone communication for people with hearing loss.

AB  - The saturation of mobile phones throughout Australia has led to some individuals being unable to regulate their use within situations that are inappropriate or risky. One of the most prevalent risky mobile phone use behaviours is texting while driving. Attempts to explain texting while driving suggest cognitive variables and personality characteristics are key factors. This study explored relationships between trait self-regulation, habitual text messaging, trait mindfulness, and texting while driving. One hundred and seventy participants comprising Australian undergraduate psychology students and members of the public completed an online survey measuring trait self-regulation, habitual text messaging behaviour, trait mindfulness, and frequency of texting while driving. It was found that habitual texting behaviour mediated the relationship between trait self-regulation and frequency of texting while driving. Additionally, trait mindfulness moderated the relationship between habit and texting while driving, such that habitual texting was significantly, positively related to texting while driving, but only for individuals with low to moderate trait mindfulness. These results suggest personality constructs related to attention, awareness, and control of behaviour play a significant role in counteracting the association that habitual texting behaviour has with the frequency of texting while driving. As these traits are considered malleable, this association may be applicable in future development of intervention programs aimed at increasing control over mobile phone use and reducing the frequency with which people text while driving.

AB  - A review of popular technology adoption models identified several factors that are likely to influence Voice Activated Personal Assistant (VAPA) use in public spaces. To inform design decisions of how to make the private use of the VAPA in public spaces more acceptable from the users' point of view, an online survey was conducted to investigate the likelihood of usage of the smartphone VAPA such as Apple's Siri (compared to the usage of smartphone keyboard) as a function of location (private vs. public) and type of information (private vs. nonprivate). Responses from participants showed that users were more cautious of transmitting private than nonprivate information. This effect of type of information was amplified in the social context of public locations and when using conspicuous methods of information input such as the VAPA. Participants also preferred using the VAPA in private locations and showed no preference of location for keyboard entries. Correlations between likelihood of usage of VAPA and the social acceptability ratings were positive and predicted similar patterns of smartphone usage.

AB  - We conducted a pilot study to assess the feasibility of a web-based therapy management system with mobile phone access to support obese patients. A total of 25 patients participated in the study. The mean age of the patients was 48 years. The mean body mass index of the patients at recruitment was 35.6 kg/m². The mean observation period was 70 days. A total of 361 successful data transmissions was performed—the mean number of transmissions per patient was 14. The total number of outgoing reminder messages was 123, corresponding to 4.9 reminder messages per patient. At the end of the study, there were significant reductions of 2.4 cm in abdominal girth (P < 0.001), 2.4 kg in bodyweight (P < 0.001) and 0.78 kg/m² in body mass index (P < 0.001). In a questionnaire at the end of the study, the majority of the participants gave answers that indicated a positive attitude towards the system. The pilot study showed that mobile phones can be utilized as patient terminals for therapy in patients suffering from obesity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - While recent evidence has pointed to disturbances in emotion regulation strategy use in schizophrenia, few studies have examined how these regulation strategies relate to emotionality and social behavior in daily life. Using ecological momentary assessment (EMA), we investigated the relationship between emotion regulation, emotional experience, and social interaction in the daily lives of individuals with schizophrenia. Participants (N = 30) used mobile phones to complete online questionnaires reporting their daily emotional experience and social interaction. Participants also completed self-report measures of habitual emotion regulation. Hierarchical linear modeling revealed that self-reported use of cognitive reappraisal and savoring of emotional experiences were related to greater positive emotion in daily life. In contrast, self-reported suppression was related to greater negative emotion, reduced positive emotion, and reduced social interaction in daily life. These findings suggest that individual differences in habitual emotion regulation strategy usage have important relationships to everyday emotional and social experiences in schizophrenia.

AB  - Background: Given limited extant research, we assessed the use of portable, battery-powered cannabis vaporizers by adult e-cigarette users. Methods: 522 adult vapers completed an online survey. Demographics; lifetime and past-month cannabis vaporization via e-cigarettes/vape-pens; preferences for hash oil, D-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) wax, or dried buds; and cannabis vaporization beliefs and motives were examined. Demographics, age of e-cigarette onset, e-cigarette use frequency, state-level legal status of cannabis, cannabis vaping beliefs/motives, and impulsivity were examined as predictors of lifetime cannabis vaporization, past-month cannabis vaporization, and cannabis vaping frequency. Results: E-cigarette users reported lifetime (17.8%) and past-month (11.5%) cannabis vaporization. Vapers preferred hash oil (LT/PM 45.5/47.5%), THC wax (15.2/32.2%), and dried buds (39.4/35.6%). Motivations to vape cannabis included: it tastes better (39.3/37.9%), is healthier (42.9/39.7%), is easier to conceal/hide (35.7/46.6%), does not smell as strong (42.9/39.7%), is more convenient (42.9/27.6%), and produces a stronger/better high (58.1/40.7%) than smoking cannabis. Lifetime and past-month cannabis vaporization, respectively, were associated with initiating e-cigarette use at an earlier age (odds ratio (OR) = 0.09/0.88), being impulsive (OR = 2.25/3.23), having poor self-control (OR = 2.23/1.85), and vaporizing cannabis because it is easier to conceal/hide (OR = 2.45/2.48) or is more convenient than smoking cannabis (OR = 5.02/2.83). Frequency of vaping cannabis was associated with heavier e-cigarette use (ηp² = 0.10) and impulsivity (ηp2 = 0.09). Conclusions: Adult e-cigarette users are vaporizing cannabis using e-cigarettes/vape-pens. Efforts to curb cannabis vaporization may benefit from targeting impulsivity in users and regulating device features that facilitate or promote convenient, inconspicuous cannabis use.

AB  - The vast majority of consumer behavior research has examined how consumers respond to products that are offered on a "take it or leave it" basis by the manufacturer. Self-design changes the rules substantially, allowing consumers to have much more control over the product's characteristics. This research examines the factors influencing consumers' evaluations of self-designed products. Three studies demonstrate that a superior fit between consumers' underlying preferences and their customized products cannot fully explain self-design evaluations. Comparisons with designers of comparable products can significantly influence evaluations as well. The first two experiments examine how social comparisons with the designers of similar "off-the-rack" products influence evaluations, identifying two key moderators useful in overcoming the negative effects of an upward comparison. A third study uses a real online design task to gain understanding of how the timing of the social comparison moderates the direction of the comparison (upward vs. equivalent) to influence evaluations. © 2009 by Journal of Consumer Research, Inc.

AB  - Digital technology development has been proposed to explain higher levels of sedentary behaviour; but this has not yet been confirmed. Thus, here we evaluated the impact of digital development on sedentary behaviour using two metrics: digital country development and e-devices ownership from the Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) and the Eurobarometer 88.4 cross-sectional survey with 28,031 participants ≥ 15 years old. From an environmental macro perspective, at the national level, a simple linear regression has been performed between the DESI and mean sitting time per country. To develop a micro approach to this phenomenon, binomial logistic regression models have been run among individual e-devices ownership and the daily amount of time spent sitting (≤3.5 h/day, > 4.5 h/day). Digital country development is positively related to sitting time, whereas the ownership of e-device (either DVD player, CD player, desk computer, laptop, and Internet connection) was associated with a higher sitting time (>4.5 h/day) in the overall population, with slight differences by gender. While further research is needed to understand the effect of digitalization on sedentary behaviour throughout time, here we document how it is associated with higher sitting time, as assessed through both macro and micro approaches.

AB  - Technology can help support the goal of many older adults to live independently, though cognitive, attitudinal, and other barriers often result in a 'digital divide' in which older adults use and adopt new technology at a lower rate compared to younger adults. Due to the many potential benefits of technology it is not surprising that interest in tools that assess technology proficiency among older adults has increased. These tools can help support older adult technology research and training. However, to understand these issues more broadly, especially cross-cultural determinants of technology proficiency, translated, validated, and standardized measures of proficiency are necessary. For example, according to the last Eurobarometer (European Commission, 2015), Spain has experienced the largest increase in technology adoption among European Union nations in the past few years, indicating potential cultural mediation of technology adoption and use. To benefit the investigation of cross-cultural differences and their causes, we adapted the Mobile Device Proficiency Questionnaire (MDPQ) and Computer Proficiency Questionnaire (CPQ) for older adults in Spain, including the full and brief forms of each measure. Consistent with English versions of the questionnaires, the scales and their subscales were found to be reliable and valid measures of mobile device and computer proficiency in Spanish older adults. However, in contrast to earlier studies, the factor structure for both questionnaires simplified into two factors for the population under study. We conclude that the Spanish versions of the MDPQ and CPQ can be employed as useful tools for measuring mobile device and computer proficiency in the Spanish older adult population for research and training purposes.

AB  - Background: Few studies of employed people who use wheelchairs, canes, crutches or walkers have been reported in the literature. One reason for this paucity of research reports is that surveys are most often made of unemployed individuals with disabilities a defined broadly. Understanding the work site of successfully employed people who use mobility devices requires the development of as survey that can be used to examine the important features of worksite from employees who use mobility devices at their worksites. Objective: This article describes the development and psychometrics of a survey on currently employed people with lower limb impairments and mobility limitations who use mobility devices. The items in the Mobility Device User Work Survey (MWS) were based on interviews and survey items pilot tested on employed mobility device users. Participants: A sample of 183 employed people who use mobility devices including wheelchairs, canes, crutches or walkers was recruited using internet postings on disability-related organization web sites. The average age of the sample was 46.3, most were college educated, 72% used wheelchairs and the average number of years of employment was 24. Methods: The MWS was completed by 183 people who met the inclusion criteria. The survey was sent to these same people a second time and 132 of them returned the second survey. Results: The MWS consists of 106 questions on demographic, work and worksite characteristics and 58 subjective evaluation items that were organized into five scales. The internal consistencies (Cronbach’s alpha) of the five scales were moderate (0.72) to good (0.93). Stability values of the five scales were calculated using correlations between forms and ranged from 0.70 to 0.80. The evaluative scales were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis. Conclusions: The MWS provides a tool for studying the variables that influence employed people who use mobility devices. Future studies of unemployed people who use mobility devices may benefit from using the results of the MWS to plan interventions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Extensive reading (ER) in EFL is an approach to language learning that involves reading as much as possible for pleasure or information. ER improves reading speed and vocabulary acquisition and helps develop positive attitudes towards reading in general. The widespread use of digital devices such as mobile phones and tablets in and out of school has considerably widened the reading possibilities for EFL learners. ER through mobile devices is an emerging area of study and this chapter aims to contribute to the research by investigating its effects on vocabulary learning and student attitudes towards using mobile devices for their reading. The study records the results of an e-book ER programme at lower secondary school level in the Milan metropolitan area in Italy. The participants were 72 11-year-old students from two state schools. The students read 16 e-books at CEFR A1 and A2 levels over the course of eight months alongside the standard EFL school programme. Following a mixed method approach, the teachers, who were also researchers, asked students to complete a test on vocabulary items selected from the e-books both pre- and post-programme. Results from the analysis of vocabulary tests and questionnaires show positive effects of e-reading on incidental vocabulary learning and increased motivation towards EFL reading on mobile devices.

AB  - This article discusses the changing role of the media for minority languages in the context of the development of the digital media market. Media use in minority languages is affected by the position of the language in a growing digital market. The role of the media in daily language use is assessed against a development whereby digital media play an ever greater role due to increased daily usage of media. The asymmetric position of minority languages makes them particularly vulnerable to unfavourable changes in the media landscape. Internet-based and mobile digital media are likely to introduce such changes. The key question addressed in this article is whether the media landscape in its new form can maintain its institutional capacity to embrace and serve minority languages, and under what conditions. How are the intentions that are inherent in international policy instruments for the protection and promotion of minority languages served if these instruments are not applied according to the requirements set by the new conditions? The article calls for measures to balance the negative effects of the digital changes on minority languages by strengthening policy measures in this field. The empirical focus of the article leans towards developments in Western Europe, with a view towards examples elsewhere.

AB  - Users acceptance of innovative product appearance authoring tools based on Spatial Augmented Reality (SAR) is still limited due to their perception of a high technology complexity and a low performance/functionality of the current interaction systems. The integration of SAR technologies in professional design activities is still marginal, though many studies in this field have already proved their potential as supporting tools. To overcome this barrier, efficient means for interacting with the digital images projected onto the surfaces of real objects are essential. The aim of the current study is to respond to this demand by proposing and validating three UI configurations displayed by an unique and portable device embedded with a touch screen. These interface layouts, designed to cooperate with the output of the SAR system and to not affect the well-known benefits of its augmented environment, provide different types of visual feedback to the user by duplicating, extending or hiding the information already displayed by the projected mock-up. The experimental study reported here, performed with a panel of 41 subjects, revealed that accuracy, efficiency and perceived usability of the proposed solutions are comparable with each other and in comparison to standard desktop setups commonly used for design activities. According to these findings, the research simultaneously demonstrates (i) the high performances achieved by the touch device when coupled with a SAR system during the execution of authoring tasks, (ii) the capability of the projected mock-up to behave as an actual three-dimensional display for the real time rendering of the product appearance and (iii) the possibility to freely select according to the users preference, the design task or the type of product one of the three UI configurations without affecting the quality of the result.

AB  - Home computer users are regularly advised to install software updates to stay secure. Windows 10 Home Edition automatically downloads and installs updates, restarting the computer if needed. Automatic restarts can be managed through a number of features, such as 'active hours' (within which a computer will not restart to complete an update) or by setting a time for restart. Applications active prior to a restart can register with the operating system, to automatically restart once updates have been installed. This research investigates if the features Microsoft provides for managing updates on Windows 10 Home Edition are appropriate for computer owners. We build a model of Windows 10 update behaviour, identifying interaction points between update features and users. We contrast theory with reality in a survey with 93 Windows 10 Home users, capturing experiences and perceptions. While overall perceptions of updates were positive, the pattern of use of most participants was incompatible with the default 'active hours' settings (28% of participants knew of its existence). Participants were mostly unaware of quality (bug fix) updates, mostly perceiving that updates add features. Half of our participants reported unexpected restarts, while half also reported growing concern about the state of their device if an update took a long time. Those with previous negative update experiences had weaker beliefs about their ability to control updates than those who had not. To make the updates less disruptive, applications can request to be restarted by Windows after a reboot. Of the 47 commonly used applications which were tested, only two supported seamless continuation after a restart. Unsaved data were lost in 21 applications, and 14 appeared to rely on internal autosave features to capture unsaved data, but did not completely restore User Interface arrangements. We recommend that operating systems obtain explicit permission for restarts, consistently; there are opportunities for features such as active hours and update progress displays to learn from usage activity. At the same time, applications should be more resilient to restarts to reduce the burden on users to recover their activities.

AB  - Populist parties are often argued to be very skilled in using digital media to attract supporters and strengthen linkages with their followers. However, only rarely has research shown this linkage empirically. This study explores whether arguments about the relation between digital platforms and populist voting can be substantiated using comparative survey data in France, Germany and Italy. Digital media include a variety of online platforms that can affect populist vote in different ways. This article addresses the relation between the political use of digital platforms and the populist vote. First, it looks at how the use of Social Networking Sites (SNS) and Mobile Instant Messaging Services (MIMS) is related to voting for populist parties. Second, it assesses whether the role of digital platforms is different for supporting digital ‘immigrant’ and digital ‘native’ populist parties. Third, it explores country differences in the relation between SNS and MIMS’ use and the populist vote. Using original online surveys, the article shows that political activities on SNS and MIMS platforms (sending messages or posting, discussing or convincing others to vote for a candidate) increase the probability of voting for populist parties. However, it also finds that the political use of digital media is associated with the populist vote under certain (and limited) circumstances, that is only for a subset of populist parties. Finally, it identifies important differences in how SNS and MIMS are linked to the populist vote in countries presenting diverse institutional features, web regulations and constellations of media systems.

AB  - Jointly working on shared digital artifacts - such as wikis - is a well-tried method of developing knowledge collectively within a group or organization. Our assumption is that such knowledge maturing is an accommodation process that can be measured by taking the writing process itself into account. This paper describes the development of a tool that detects accommodation automatically with the help of machine learning algorithms. We applied a software framework for task detection to the automatic identification of accommodation processes within a wiki. To set up the learning algorithms and test its performance, we conducted an empirical study, in which participants had to contribute to a wiki and, at the same time, identify their own tasks. Two domain experts evaluated the participants' micro-tasks with regard to accommodation. We then applied an ontology-based task detection approach that identified accommodation with a rate of 79.12%. The potential use of our tool for measuring knowledge maturing online is discussed. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cell phone use has become a mainstay in the lives of young adults, with 93% of Millennials owning a smartphone. With the increased accessibility of technology, individuals? cell phone use may lead to personal distress in various facets of life. Specifically, problematic cell phone use may be the result of attempts to fulfill emotional needs or avoid connection with others. The present study used a systemic, attachment-based lens to investigate the roles of parental and romantic attachment in problematic cell phone use. A sample of 479 young adults (ages 18?26) completed an online survey gauging their cell phone use and attachment styles. Mediation analyzes were run to determine if adult attachment mediates the relationship from parental attachment to problematic cell phone use. The results found that attachment anxiety mediates the relationship between communication and alienation subscales for mother and alienation only for father to problematic cell phone use. Clinical implications are discussed with results informing assessment, prevention, and intervention efforts for individuals, families, and couples.

AB  - Smartphone use is transforming the meaning of being online, especially for African-Americans and Latinos. To what extent has this enabled these populations to become digital citizens, able to participate in society online? Internet use is increasingly important for the exercise of the political, economic and social rights that have often been associated with citizenship [Mossberger, K., Tolbert, C. J., & McNeal, R. S. (2008). Digital citizenship: The Internet, society, and participation. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press], and can be measured by the political and economic activities that individuals engage in online. Using unique survey data from a diverse city, we use multilevel analysis and interactions to examine relationships between forms of access and activities online in 2013, controlling for neighborhood context as well as individual characteristics. In contrast with prior work, we find that while broadband access is most strongly associated with political and economic activities online, that mobile is as well. The effects are strongest for African-Americans and Latinos, especially for Latinos who live in heavily Latino neighborhoods - who have lagged behind furthest in Internet use.

AB  - How should we measure broadband adoption by individuals and communities, given different modes of access, including home broadband, smartphone use, and public access? We measure online activities and indicators of skill to understand opportunities for digital citizenship, or participation in society online. Based on a 2011 survey in Chicago, we find more mobile phone adoption among Blacks than among non-Hispanic Whites, and greater likelihood of Internet use for job searches among residents who rely primarily on smartphones to go online than among home broadband adopters. Yet our analysis also shows that broadband at home remains critically important for digital citizenship, and that the growth in mobile phone use has not erased inequalities in participation online and seems unlikely to do so. Moreover, smartphones are not bridging the gap in disadvantaged communities. Multilevel statistical models show inequality in both Internet access and economic and political activities across geographic areas, or communities. Technology disparities that are patterned by place have implications for opportunity and equity at the neighborhood level. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Smart phone marketers are finding it difficult to maintain market share in a market characterised by fierce competition and continued new product development. Generation Y consumers generally have a good command of technology and engage in technology -related behaviour such as texting, tweeting and web-surfing. When it comes to the adoption of smart phone applications, it is believed that Generation Y is leading the way. To retain Generation Y consumers, it is critical for organisations to ensure that customer satisfaction is achieved, brand loyalty has to be generated and meaningful long-term relationships with these consumers should be established. In this regard, this study aims to determine the interrelationships between customer satisfaction, brand loyalty and the relationship intentions of Generation Y smart phone users. Self-administered questionnaires were fielded among 395 Generation Y smart phone users living in Gauteng, South Africa. Results indicate significant and positive interrelationships between customer satisfaction, brand loyalty and relationship intention.

AB  - Young people are often referred to as digital natives, who are familiar with digital technologies such as computers, the Internet and mobile phones for communication, entertainment and accessing information. As a result scholars have called for an educational approach that bypasses the traditional unidirectional lecture teaching style, and applies a more hands-on, learner-centered method, which includes information and communications technologies (ICT) environments and applications. Building on the outcome of expert interviews, focus group conversations and public test cases in two research projects, i.e., 'Bewaring en Ontsluiting van Multimediale data in VLaanderen' (Archiving and Distribution of Multimedia in Flanders— BOM-VL) and 'Multi-touch Multimedia Table' (MuTable), we want to reflect on the following questions by elaborating on the North Belgian (i.e., Flemish) context: How does the adoption of touch interfaces influence teaching and learning processes in classrooms and what are the implications for teaching models (traditional versus more interactive models)? Besides elaborating on the (attitudinal) bottlenecks and (pedagogical) opportunities of multi-touch displays in educational contexts, we discuss the implications for models of ownership of learning processes.

AB  - By their nature, smartphones must have small screens, and that is one of their limitations. Many users have trouble reading information on the Internet on such small screens because Internet browsers are usually designed for computers that have larger screens than smartphones. This study evaluates the usability of alternative user interfaces when reading news articles on smartphones. An experiment was conducted involving 120 smartphone users who were asked to evaluate six types of user interfaces based on three methods (pop-up, full-screen, and auto-zooming) and two display orientations (horizontal, vertical) in one of two languages (English and Persian). The participants were assigned four typical tasks that users must perform to obtain information from the Internet, that is, finding, refinding, reading, and browsing; they were asked to conduct the tasks in random order. In addition, a questionnaire was used to measure the efficiency and effectiveness of the participants' completion of the tasks, as well as their satisfaction, compatibility, and enjoyment of the undertakings. The results indicated that method, orientation, and language affected the actual usage and the time used. Based on the human factor experiment, the full-screen method was preferred in refinding and reading, whereas the pop-up method was preferred in browsing and finding. In terms of orientation, the vertical mode was preferred, and each user's performance in the vertical mode was better in all tasks except browsing. Of interest, using the English language turned out to be more satisfying, enjoyable, and efficient to the Persian users who did the experiment in English as their second language.

AB  - Internet surveys are cost-effective and convenient, but give respondents the opportunity to search the Web for answers to factual questions. Surprisingly, few have investigated the quality of political knowledge data collected in crowd-sourced Internet samples. Using a novel technique to identify individual "cheaters'' across six data sets-collected on Amazon's Mechanical Turk (professionalized paid "workers'') and Survey-Monkey (less-professionalized unpaid "audiences'')-we find that cheating is pervasive. In addition to detecting "cheaters,'' we also show that their political knowledge is significantly inflated compared with non-cheaters, posing problems for the accurate measurement of knowledge. Fortunately, we also demonstrate that question-wording alterations can significantly improve data quality and show that cheating is less-common on mobile survey-taking platforms (compared with desktop/laptop computers).

AB  - Background and objective The objective of this study was to identify physicians' and pharmacists' perceptions of the challenges and benefits to implementing a nationwide electronic prescribing network linking medical clinics and community pharmacies in Quebec, Canada. Methods Forty-nine people (12 general practitioners, 2 managers, 33 community pharmacists, and 2 pharmacy staff members) from 40 points of care (10 primary care clinics (42% of all the connected sites) and 30 community pharmacies (44%)) were interviewed in 2013. Verbatim transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results A low level of network use was observed. Most pharmacists processed e-prescriptions by manual entry instead of importing electronically. They reported concerns about potential errors generated by importing e-prescriptions, mainly due to the instruction field. Paper prescriptions were still perceived as the best means for safe and effective processing of prescriptions in pharmacies. Speed issues when validating e-prescription messages were seen as an irritant by physicians, and resulted in several of them abandoning transmission. Displaying the medications based on the dispensing data was identified as the main obstacle to meaningful use of medication histories. Conclusions Numerous challenges impeded realization of the benefits of this network. Standards for e-prescription messages, as well as rules for message validation, need to be improved to increase the potential benefits of e-prescriptions. Standard drug terminology including the concept of clinical medication should be developed, and the implementation of rules in local applications to allow for the classification and reconciliation of medication lists from dispensing data should be made a priority.

AB  - Greece is one of the few European countries that has not yet a fully operating Cadastre at national coverage. Cadastral surveying and property registration have been completed only for about 8% of the Greek territory, which includes about 18% of the total property rights. At the remaining areas, cadastral surveying and property registration is still under development and is expected to be completed by the end of 2021. The cadastral survey is a participatory procedure in which property right holders, or their representatives, are expected to declare the land parcels on which they have property rights and submit all documents that prove these rights. The time frame available for the declaration is 3 months, which is specific for each municipality. Right holders are now enabled to provide both spatial and descriptive information, regarding their properties and property rights, without the need of a professional. That includes the parcel's boundary lines along with the legal documents required to validate the declaration. Each right holder, or a representative, has the option to submit a declaration over the internet through a web application without the need of a professional. Within the frame of a PhD research, several concerns were addressed such as usability, security, and scalability in order for the outcome to support its scope while respecting binding constrains. As a result, two web applications have been created to officially support the Hellenic Cadaster property rights declaration process. The suggested approach was considered a big success in terms of both public acceptance and usability as shown from the statistics collected during the first eight months of its formal operation.

AB  - Several state prisons have provided tablets to imprisoned people which appears to be indicative of a larger trend to increase access to technology for imprisoned people. However, access to and the use of technology in prison has not been evaluated by social scientists. This study surveyed 70 prison officials from six states to report their attitudes toward access to and the use of tablets in prison for imprisoned people and for the prisons themselves. Survey results show that prison officials who work in prisons with more access to technology are more likely to believe technology to be a positive contribution for imprisoned people.

AB  - Studies have shown that any information and communication technology (ICT) intervention that improves the livelihoods of poor rural families is likely to have a significant impact (direct and indirect) on enhancing agricultural production, marketing, and post-harvest activities. Notable ICT services include: online information services; communication between researchers, extension (knowledge) workers, and farmers; updates on current market information; weather forecasting; input supplies; and credit availability. The lack of up-to-date ICTs can negatively affect information access and utilization among information users. The study sought to investigate the levels of ICT access and utilization by researchers and extension workers within the Ministry of Agriculture, Mechanisation and Irrigation Development and how this affected the generation and dissemination of agricultural information among researchers and extension workers. Survey questionnaires were distributed to researchers at the various institutes in the five agro-ecological zones and to extension workers in 10 provinces. The study revealed that the role of ICTs in work and as an information channel was considered inadequate despite the indications by the majority of extension workers and researchers that they had access to ICTs. Findings on the utilization of ICTs in managing information generated by the Departments of Research and Specialist Services and Agricultural Technical and Extension Services revealed that while some ICTs were used to generate documents, most distribution of documents involved hard copies. Available ICTs included computers, printers, telephones, television, Internet, mobile phones, and fax machines, and these were considered effective in the dissemination of agricultural information, although the levels of effectiveness varied according to the resources and respondents.

AB  - Recent developments in surveillance practices and their related technologies suggest that the heretofore dominant Foucauldian paradigm of discipline, with its sites of confinement in which space is 'segmented, immobile [and] frozen', may no longer be an adequate theoretical framework in which to discuss space within surveillance studies (Foucault 1995: 195). In his essay Postscript on Control Societies, Gilles Deleuze claims that these sites are in the midst of widespread breakdown, leading to a fundamental shift in the notion of space, characterised by the term 'modulation' (Deleuze 1990: 178-179). In the control model, urban surveillance can be said to be characterised by an emphasis on the use of digital surveillance practices, leading to a view of urban space and the city, as well as its inhabitants, which largely resides within a computer mainframe. This raises a question: if the surveillance carried out within this conception of urban space can be described as concentrated, hidden, passive, functional, mobile, and varied, how can these changes be communicated cinematically since there is an obvious problem of representation; when much of the surveillance technology is computer and digital in form, how does cinema make visible the potentially invisible? In considering the question of how film engages with urban space between the paradigms of discipline and control, two cinematic views of the (informational) city will be discussed by considering three scenes from Erasing David (2009) and Minority Report (2002) in order to identify some of the cinematic strategies used in communicating contemporary surveillance practices increasingly characterised as invisible and immaterial.

First, I question two aspects of the work: the Computers Are Social Actors (CASA) approach, and the use of psychophysiological measurements of emotion without a stated theory of emotion. Despite these criticisms, the contributions of Picard and colleagues are valuable and powerfully challenging. I suggest three convergent ways to pursue this important research program. © 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The ubiquity of internet-capable mobile devices enables individuals to use online communication and social networking sites (SNSs) almost anytime and anywhere, which may foster addictive usage patterns. SNSs provide manifold options and suggestions for social contacts and experiences, which can increase social comparison processes that potentially cause negative affective states, such as envy, dissatisfaction, or fear of missing out (FoMO). This empirical study (N= 226) investigates associations between the tendencies to maximize outcomes and to procrastinate and problematic social networks use. We assume socially driven cognitions such as FoMO and the tendency to switch or cancel appointments at short notice, named "social zapping," to mediate these effects. We tested the hypothesized effects through structural equation modeling. The results confirm positive associations between the mentioned constructs. Procrastination fully mediated the effect of maximization on problematic social networks use. Furthermore, FoMO mediated the effects of both maximization and procrastination. The findings indicate that tendencies to maximize and to procrastinate lead to problematic SNS use, especially in cases where specific fears and intentions to find/to not miss a potentially "better" alternative for social experiences are high. Potential relationships and reinforcement mechanisms in the developmental process of problematic social networks use are discussed.

AB  - Background: Children born with permanent hearing loss have the opportunity to receive services earlier as a result of newborn hearing screening (NHS). We conducted a survey to address three aspects within the early hearing detection and intervention (EHDI) process; (1) timeliness of service delivery, (2) hearing device access, and (3) hearing aid management. Parent experiences provide valuable information in identifying existing challenges for these components of the EHDI system. Purpose: The aim was to investigate parent experiences as they access and manage hearing aids for their child. Research Design: A cross-sectional, population-based survey was used. Study Sample: Three hundred fifty-two completed surveys from parents of children born between 1977 and 2010 were returned from 45 states in the United States. Data Collection and Analysis: Responses were obtained online and through the mail, and were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: Over time, the age of hearing loss identification has decreased to a median of 2 mo, age of first hearing aid fitting has decreased to a median of 5 mo, and the delay between hearing loss identification and hearing aid fitting has remained the same with a median of 2 mo. For children born between 2007 and 2010, the top three challenges parents reported in obtaining hearing aids were (1) paying for hearing aids, (2) accepting the. need for hearing aids, and (3) wait time for an appointment. Almost one-half (48%) of the parents reported that they did not receive adequate support from their audiologist in how to check the function of their child's hearing aids. Conclusions: Significant progress has been made over the past two decades in reducing the age of hearing loss identification and hearing aid fitting for children who do not pass the NHS. However, many children continue to experience delays between hearing loss diagnosis and hearing aid fitting that exceed Joint Committee on Infant Hearing recommendations. The experiences parents reported provide valuable information about areas that need further investigation to improve the process for children with hearing loss.

AB  - Combining mobile tracking data and a survey experiment, Munzert et al. show that Germany's contact tracing app is underused by those who socially distance less; however, even small cash incentives increased app uptake in the cohort.
Digital contact tracing apps have been introduced globally as an instrument to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, privacy by design impedes both the evaluation of these tools and the deployment of evidence-based interventions to stimulate uptake. We combine an online panel survey with mobile tracking data to measure the actual usage of Germany's official contact tracing app and reveal higher uptake rates among respondents with an increased risk of severe illness, but lower rates among those with a heightened risk of exposure to COVID-19. Using a randomized intervention, we show that informative and motivational video messages have very limited effect on uptake. However, findings from a second intervention suggest that even small monetary incentives can strongly increase uptake and help make digital contact tracing a more effective tool.

AB  - This paper describes an experiment which aims to examine the effectiveness and efficiency of a Virtual Reality Modelling Language (VRML) building model compared with equivalent architectural plans, for direction finding purposes. The effectiveness and efficiency issues being primarily investigated were number of tasks completed overall and task completion times. The experiment involved a series of tasks where participants had to find a number of locations/objects in a building unknown to them at the outset of the experiment. Statistically significant results are presented for the benefit of the research community, law enforcement officers and fire fighters where it is clear that in this context, the VRML model led to better task completions than the equivalent architectural plans. Regarding the task completion times, no statistical significance was found. Given the current climate of security issues and terrorist threats, it is important that law enforcement officers have at their disposal the best information possible regarding the layout of a building, whilst keeping costs down. This also applies to fire fighters when rescuing victims. This experiment has shown that a VRML model leads to better task completions in direction finding. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article compares Global Assessment of Function (GAF) and Client Satisfaction Survey scores for clients receiving either face-to-face or online counselling. Clients were assessed by phone and then assigned to one of the two modalities. Analyses of variance were conducted with α = 0.05, to examine differences between counselling modalities. No significant differences were found for degree of change in GAF between assessment and closing between the two modalities. Some differences were found in Client Satisfaction Scores. Implications for screening and social work practice are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Using Twitter as a case study, this article hypothesizes that social media content that is produced on mobile versus web platforms may be qualitatively different. As we increasingly tweet from our smartphones, we may be encouraged to "report" on our immediate thoughts, feelings, physical self, and surroundings. This article seeks to understand whether these presentations of self tend to be more egocentric, negative/positive, gendered, or communal depending on whether they were tweeted from mobile devices or web platforms. Using 6 weeks of Twitter data collected in 2013, we found evidence that users tweet differently from mobile devices and that mobile tweeting is informing new behaviors, attitudes, and linguistic styles online.

AB  - The findings for this article emerge from data collected in June 2010, during a week-long annual workshop with three groups of 14-year-olds. Working with a central London Academy school, the project as a whole asked teenagers to 'map' their journeys through their local environment, using a range of media from static cameras to audio recorders to mobile phones and flip cameras. It asked the teenagers to reflect on those journeys through group and individual interviews and through the editing process of converting their recordings into a mini-documentary of their area. In the course of a week, each group filmed, recorded, edited and produced a 'documentary', which was then showcased to their peers. At the end of each day, the audio-visual data was uploaded to group laptops and saved, along with the interviews. Our reflections and comments were also recorded and transcribed, along with our images and recordings of the processes during the day. The initial premise for the project was to move beyond conceptions of the so-called 'digital native' and conceptions of young people per se, and investigate the more nuanced engagements with media and with local environments. Our findings raise pertinent questions around understanding, conceptualizing, and working with young people. They also suggest, contrary to discourse of the so-called 'digital-native' (see Bennett et al., 2008, for discussions of the concept, and Thornham and McFarlane, 2011: 25879), that when teenagers are given innovative and novel media, they rarely use such media in intended ways.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to analyse the determinants for digital divide in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) by considering inequalities in internet use and broadband subscriptions. The study considers 41 countries in the region which are geographically linked, and it allows for spatial interdependence. It also accounts for differences in demographic characteristics as well as social, political and economic infrastructure which affect ICT access and use. Globally, about half of the world's population is connected to the internet whereas the remaining half, i.e. about 3.8 billion people, are not (yet) connected. The problem is more severe in developing countries compared to developed countries; it is said to be unsatisfactory in SSA compared to other countries. We apply a spatial panel analysis using the spatial Durbin model (SDM) specifications for 451 observations from 2006 to 2016. Our estimation results show that there is a strong spatial interdependence among SSA, implying that internet access and broadband subscriptions in one country are affected by internet access and broadband subscriptions in another country, most likely due to spillover effects. Our results reveal that GDP per capita, gross capital formation, political stability, regulatory efficacy and electricity infrastructure directly affect the digital divide. Moreover, GDP per capita, population growth, government consumption, trade openness, and electricity infrastructure also indirectly affect the digital divide through spillover effects. Regarding policy implications we suggest that SSA governments should work closer together in ensuring internet openness and to increase the level of coordination between their countries in order to ensure digital inclusion in their countries.

AB  - Mobile device use has become increasingly prevalent, yet its impact on infant development remains largely unknown. When parents use mobile devices in front of infants, the parent is physically present but most likely distracted and unresponsive. Research using the classic Still Face Paradigm (SFP) suggests that parental withdrawal and unresponsiveness may have negative consequences for children's social-emotional development. In the present study, 50 infants aged 7.20 to 23.60 months (M = 15.40, SD = 4.74) and their mothers completed a modified SFP. The SFP consisted of three phases: free play (FP; parent and infant play and interact), still face (SF; parent withdraws attention and becomes unresponsive), and reunion (RU; parent resumes normal interaction). The modified SFP incorporated mobile device use in the SF phase. Parents reported on their typical mobile device use and infant temperament. Consistent with the standard SFP, infants showed more negative affect and less positive affect during SF versus FP. Infants also showed more toy engagement and more engagement with mother during FP versus SF and RU. Infants showed the most social bids during SF and more room exploration in SF than RU. More frequent reported mobile device use was associated with less room exploration and positive affect during SF, and less recovery (i.e., engagement with mother, room exploration positive affect) during RU, even when controlling for individual differences in temperament. Findings suggest that the SFP represents a promising theoretical framework for understanding the impact of parent's mobile device use on infant social-emotional functioning and parent-infant interactions.

AB  - Given persistent communication inequalities, it is important to develop interventions to improve Internet and health literacy among underserved populations. These goals drove the Click to Connect project, a community-based eHealth intervention that provided novice computer users of low socioeconomic position with broadband Internet access, training classes, a Web portal, and technical support. In this article, we describe the strategies used to recruit and retain this population, the budgetary implications of such strategies, and the challenges and successes we encountered. Results suggest that personal contact between study staff and participants and provision of in-depth technical support were central to successful recruitment and retention. Such investments are essential to realize the promise of eHealth with underserved populations. © 2013 International Communication Association.

AB  - This study draws on communication infrastructure theory (CIT) to examine the extent to which expressive uses of Internet and mobile devices moderate the relationship between integrated connectedness to a storytelling network (ICSN) and offline and online civic participation. Data collected through a Web survey of a U.S. national online panel ( N = 1201) reveal that the relationships of ICSN with offline and online civic participation are conditioned by locality-oriented expressive uses of Internet and mobile media. With these findings, this study discusses theoretical insights, policy implications, and practical applications. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Lifelog is the foundation on which lifelong services and healthcare services are implemented in a smart home system. It also plays a major role in the sub-processes of the system because it acquires information about the home's residents for home automation and entertainment. Providing personalized services to individuals by acquiring and managing this personal lifelog information has great advantages in terms of service satisfaction and effectiveness. In this paper, we implemented a personal search system based on android that collected and stored an individual's lifelog based on nine smart phone sensors and used it to derive new meaningful information about the user. The activity recognition module for classifying the user's behavior, the naive Bayesian method, showed an accuracy of 88.23% and the area under the ROC curve value of 0.941. We designed and implemented density-based spatial clustering method in the module for extracting the point of interest and the participants filled out a satisfaction questionnaire to evaluate the search system. The proposed system efficiently uses a large amount of lifelog data and automates the process of extracting meaningful information, associating it according to the user's intention.

In this paper, we ask whether online news has any influence on the financial market, and we also investigate how much influence it has. We explore the burgeoning literature on the predictability of financial movements using online information and report its mixed findings. In addition, we collate the efforts of various disciplines, including economics, text mining, sentiment analysis and machine learning, and we offer suggestions for future research.

AB  - Documentary has been so closely associated with the mediums of film and television that the emergence of new forms of documentary, made for computerized mediums such as the Internet, mobile phones and tablets appear fundamentally transformative. The potential for audiences to interact with documentary in various ways is at the heart of what makes these new modes of documentary distinctive; audiences are potentially able to engage in a range of practices from navigating virtual environments, to choosing video content from a database, taking part in 'chat' sessions and creating content. Engaging theoretically with these emerging audience practices raises questions about authorship and the social impact of documentary. In this paper, interactivity and participation are considered from a social perspective. It is suggested that there is a need to distinguish between user actions that impact on the documentary text and the ability of users to engage with others through documentary. The concept of documentary voice is interrogated to reveal two distinct dimensions: voice-as-authorship and voice-as-social participation. Drawing on documentary and digital media scholarship, this paper explores the social functions of documentary interactivity and participation with reference to a range of web-documentary examples.

AB  - Computers, mobile phones and other information and communication technologies (ICTs) have become a major part of the everyday life in affluent societies, yet significant socio-demographic disparities remain in their use. Young adults in particular continue to be much more active users of ICTs than the older generations. In this article we explore an approach to understand the institutional implications of ICT usage disparity: the socio-psychological significance of a technology to its users. We argue that identification mediated by technology is for many purposes at least as important of a measure as the actual quantity and quality of their use for many peer groups. Analyses of a nationally representative survey sample collected in 2009 (Na=a1202) indicate that young Finns identify with online communities significantly more strongly than their elders do. Overall, however Finns identify much more with traditional offline formations. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

AB  - This exploratory experiment tested the effect of two virtual reality (VR) relaxation interventions on measures of physiological arousal and affect, compared to a control. Forty-nine participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions, all using the Oculus Rift. Participants wore a heart rate (HR) monitor and completed pre- and post-test surveys, including the positive and negative affect schedule, Likert-type and open feedback questions. Mixed repeated measures ANOVAs revealed significant reductions in HR and affect over time across all conditions, with a significant interaction identified for the breathing condition's effect on negative affect. Participants were able to identify feeling relaxation, as well as influencing factors. Further, the majority expected, and supported, the introduction of VR interventions in their workplace and/or college, with privacy being a common concern. These results demonstrate the potential of VR augmented relaxation interventions with recommendations for further study provided. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS: VR can potentially provide wellbeing interventions with a uniquely immersive quality Results suggest interactive and immersive VR experiences may facilitate relaxation and reduce stress Participants believe there may be substantial benefits to having VR wellbeing interventions at work and college.

AB  - The development of information and communication technologies has led to the rise of new working forms in firms, some of which are temporally and spatially dispersed, such as telework practices. However, ?telework? is a broad concept, including different forms of remote work as well as diverse reasons and performance implications for the separation of work from the firm's premises. Following this consideration, this paper has explored two sides of telework: 1) the main types of telework practises adopted by firms in relation to their technological, organizational and environmental context; 2) the association between the adoption of telework practices and labour productivity. Specifically, analysing data gathered through a survey analysis conducted from 2005 and 2009 on Italian enterprises, we identified two main typologies of telework: 1) firms using forms of home-based telework; 2) firms using mobile forms of telework. Whereas firms prevalently using the first type of telework modality do not exhibit a superior endowment of information systems and do not exhibit higher labour productivity, firms deploying ?mobile work? practices are characterized by a higher adoption of information systems, deal with more dynamic business environments and exhibit higher labour productivity with respect to firms that do not use telework practices.

AB  - Based on the premise that children are active agents who influence their parents' media use, this study investigated child-parent digital media guidance. Children often introduce new media into the family and influence parents' media adoption and use. This study also investigated whether this child-parent digital media guidance is associated with media conflicts in the family. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 187 parent-child dyads in Flanders, Belgium. Paired samples t-tests and multiple linear regression analyses were conducted. The results showed that both children and parents reported that children guide their parents how to use digital media, especially for newer media forms such as smartphones, tablets, and apps. Families where there was more child-parent digital media guidance reported more conflicts about media. These relationships were comparable in the parent and child reports.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance and test-retest reliability obtained when  administering a computerized baseline neurocognitive exam to NCAA Division I student-athletes in a controlled laboratory setting versus an uncontrolled remote location. METHOD: A sample of 129 (female = 100) Division I student-athletes completed Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT) pre-season assessments for two distinct and respective sports seasons in a controlled laboratory environment and an uncontrolled remote environment. Depending on the environment, participants were given verbal (controlled) or written (uncontrolled) guidelines for taking the test. RESULTS: Multivariate repeated-measures ANOVA's determined that there were no within-subject differences between testing environments on ImPACT composite scores and cognitive efficiency index (CEI). The Chi-square test did not find any significant differences in impulse control or the number of invalid test scores, as determined by ImPACT, between environments. Intraclass correlations found the ImPACT subtest scores to range in test-retest reliability across testing environments, demonstrating moderate (verbal memory composite, r = 0.46; visual memory composite, r = 0.64; reaction time, r = 0.61; impulse control, r = 0.52; and CEI, r = 0.61) and good (visual motor composite, r = 0.77) test-retest reliability. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that ImPACT is reliable between controlled and uncontrolled testing environments. This further suggests that ImPACT can be administered in a remote environment, pending specific adherence to testing instructions, or in the event of social distancing or isolation policies.

AB  - Online environments can be programmed to make use of movable, drag & drop objects. A drag & drop object is a geometric figure (which may contain text, pictures, or both) whose position on the screen can be changed by the user. Typically, a user accomplishes this by (a) moving the cursor over the object with a mouse or other pointing device, (b) holding down button that 'grabs' the object, (c) dragging the object to a new location by sliding the mouse or pointing device, and (d) dropping the object at the new location by releasing the button. Drag & drop objects can be useful in several self-administered measurement domains of interest to social scientists; these include visual analogue scales (VASs; Couper, Tourangeau, & Conrad, 2006), ranking tasks (Neubarth, 2008; Thurstone, 1931), magnitude scaling (Lodge, 1981), ideal scaling (Barrett, 2005; Ryf, 2007), preference point maps (Harris Interactive, 2007), and various grouping or sorting tasks (Coxon, 1999). Even preference statements (Hensher, Rose, & Greene, 2005), choice analyses (Hensher et al., 2005), and the measurement of similarities or dissimilarities (Bijmolt & Wedel, 1995; Borg & Groenen, 2005) can benefit from using movable objects instead of simple hypertext markup language (HTML) forms. This chapter explains how to implement a measurement framework for movable objects in Web questionnaires, how to define objects that can be dragged across all or predefined sections of the screen, and how to process the x- and y-coordinates of the objects. I provide code that restricts the range of the drag & drop objects to a predefined area. I also provide a function that allows one to align the objects smoothly after they are dropped. Finally, I suggest some practical applications for the movable object method and provide some further resources. This chapter will be useful to researchers who want to use drag & drop functionality in their Web research. It will also be useful for those who want to learn more about the technical basics of the document object model (DOM; see Keith, 2005, and Marini, 2002). The DOM allows objects to be moved and their positions to be saved into a data set. The chapter will also be useful to those who want to learn about the research possibilities afforded by drag & drop functionality. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Online crowdwork platforms have been praised as powerful vehicles for economic development, particularly for workers traditionally excluded from the labor market. However, there has been insufficient scrutiny as to the feasibility of crowdwork as an income-source among socioeconomically deprived populations. This article examines device requirements and differential access to digital infrastructure, both of which act as potential barriers to not only basic participation but also to economic success online. Given the increasing prevalence of mobile-first and mobile-only populations, research on this topic aids in understanding the crowdwork ecosystem among differing socioeconomic sectors. Based on a survey of 606 crowd workers across the United States and India, this article uses both quantitative and qualitative data to explore whether reliance on mobile devices is detrimental for economic outcomes of crowdwork. The results point to substantial inequalities in device use and received benefits from crowdwork, within each country and between the two contexts.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Physicians often describe the electronic health record (EHR) as a cumbersome impediment to meaningful work, which has important implications for physician well-being. This systematic review (1) assesses organizational, physician, and information technology factors associated with EHR-related impacts on physician well-being; and (2) highlights potential improvements to EHR form and function, as recommended by frontline physicians. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ProQuest, and Web of Science databases were searched for literature describing EHR use by physicians and markers of well-being. RESULTS: After reviewing 7388 article, 35 ultimately met the inclusion criteria. Multiple factors across all levels were associated with EHR-related well-being among physicians. Notable predictors amenable to interventions include (1) total EHR time, (2) after-hours EHR time, (3) on-site EHR support, (4) perceived EHR usability, (5) in-basket burden, and (6) documentation burden. Physician recommendations also echoed these themes. CONCLUSIONS: There are multiple complex factors involved in EHR-related well-being among physicians. Our review shows physicians have recommendations that span from federal regulations to organizational policies to EHR modifications. Future research should assess multipronged interventions that address these factors. As primary stakeholders, physicians should be included in the planning and implementation of such modifications to ensure compatibility with physician needs and clinical workflows.

AB  - Facebook?s usage has reached a point that the platform?s infrastructural ambitions are to be taken very seriously. To understand the company?s evolution in the age of mobile media, we critically engage with the political economy of platformization. This article puts forward a conceptual framework and methodological apparatus to study Facebook?s economic growth and expanding platform boundaries in the mobile ecosystem through an analysis of the Facebook Messenger app. Through financial and institutional analysis, we examine Messenger?s business dimension and draw on platform studies and information systems research to survey its technical dimension. By retracing how Facebook, through Messenger, operationalizes platform power, this article attempts to bridge the gap between these various disciplines by demonstrating how platforms emerge and how their apps may evolve into platforms of their own, thereby gaining infrastructural properties. It is argued that Messenger functions as a ?platform instance? that facilitates transactions with a wide range of institutions within the boundaries of the app and far beyond.

AB  - Background: Understanding factors associated with contraceptive use post-abortion can inform clinical practices to improve contraception uptake. Materials and Methods: This prospective cohort study included adult women who completed the survey before surgical abortion at an Atlanta, Georgia clinic, with an online survey 12 weeks later. Poisson regression models assessed associations between demographic and reproductive factors and use of more effective (contraceptive pill, ring, patch, injectables, intrauterine device [IUD], implant, sterilization) versus less effective (none, condoms, withdrawal, rhythm methods) contraception at follow-up. Results: Three hundred ninety three women completed the initial survey; 180 (46%) completed follow-up. Of those completing follow-up, 109 (61%) expressed interest in initiating more effective methods in-clinic, yet only 85 (47%) reported using these methods at follow-up. Sixty-one women (34%) were not using their preferred contraceptive at follow-up; 34 (56%) of whom preferred to use IUD, implant, or sterilization. More effective contraception use was significantly associated with age over 30 (adjusted risk ratio, aRR 1.71, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.14–2.57); nulliparity (aRR 1.70, 95% CI: 1.20–2.42); use of more effective methods at most recent conception (aRR 2.56, 95% CI: 1.73–3.79); interest in more effective methods at the time of the abortion (aRR 1.55, 95% CI: 1.11–2.18); and receiving a contraceptive/prescription at the time of abortion (aRR 1.97, 95% CI: 1.37–2.81). Conclusions: Over half of women use less effective contraception 3 months post-abortion, despite a high interest in more effective contraception. Additional research is needed to understand contraceptive decision making in the context of abortion care to inform interventions to increase contraceptive uptake.

AB  - This article presents results on how students became engaged and motivated when using digital storytelling in knowledge creation in Finland, Greece and California. The theoretical framework is based on sociocultural theories. Learning is seen as a result of dialogical interactions between people, substances and artefacts. This approach has been used in the creation of the Global Sharing Pedagogy (GSP) model for the empirical study of student levels of engagement in learning twenty-first century skills. This model presents a set of conceptual mediators for student-driven knowledge creation, collaboration, networking and digital literacy. Data from 319 students were collected using follow-up questionnaires after the digital storytelling project. Descriptive statistical methods, correlations, analysis of variance and regression analysis were used. The mediators of the GSP model strongly predicted student motivation and enthusiasm as well as their learning outcomes. The digital storytelling project, using the technological platform Mobile Video Experience (MoViE), was very successful in teaching twenty-first century skills.

AB  - Over the last two decades, computer-mediated and online research methods have been gaining ground over traditional data collection tools for research. As a consequence, the role of the interviewer is affected. In this article, the visibility or invisibility of the interviewer is used to express the degree of control that the interviewer has in the interviewing process. For example, the interviewer has full control in face-to-face interviews, but this control decreases as the interviewer's level of visibility decreases, such as in phone interviews, and is nullified when the interviewer is missing entirely, such as in self-administered surveys on the Web. This raises the question of how the visibility of the interviewer is currently surrogated and how the solutions adopted in social research may be suitable for describing the corresponding impact of digital technologies on social life. In concluding, possible scenarios of new digitally mediated solutions of data collection are presented.

AB  - Teachers' role can be catalytic in the introduction of innovative digital tools in order to create new learning and assessment opportunities. This study explores science technology engineering and mathematics (STEM) teachers' intention to use mobile‐based assessments in the teaching practice. The study proposes the teachers' acceptance mobile‐based assessment (TAMBA) model which extends the technology acceptance model by introducing individual, social, institutional and instructional design factors. An appropriate questionnaire was developed and answered by 161 STEM teachers from 32 European countries. Their responses were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The proposed TAMBA model explains about 50% of the variance in teachers' intention to adopt mobile‐based assessment. Perceived Ease of Use was found to be the most important determinant in teachers' intention to use mobile‐based assessment. Facilitating Conditions and Output Quality were the most influential external variables in the model. The study findings revealed that focusing on mobile assessment quality design as well as on institutional support are important factors for STEM teachers in order to accept mobile‐based assessments in schools.

AB  - Participants increasingly use mobile devices, especially smartphones, to fill out online questionnaires. However, standard questionnaire templates are often not optimized for presentation on smartphones, raising the question of whether an unfavorable layout may influence the survey results. In this study, interaction with questionnaires on different devices was investigated regarding processing time, data quality, and user experience of the questionnaire itself. Several standard and newly developed questionnaire layout templates were evaluated by means of an online study (N = 301). Results show that processing times are higher on smartphones compared to desktop computers. However, there were no differences regarding data quality. The comparison of different mobile layouts among smartphone users revealed effects on processing time and user experience. Design recommendations are derived.

AB  - With vast information that has been digitized and made available online, manually finding the answer to a question can be tedious. While search engines have emerged to facilitate information needs, users would have to manually read through the retrieved articles to locate the answer to a specific question. Therefore, the ability to automatically understand users' natural language questions and find the correct answers could prove crucial in information retrieval. Indeed, such automatic question-answering solutions have been extensively studied by the natural language processing (NLP) research communities. However, most of the development targets questions and information sources composed in high-resource languages such as English and Chinese. In this paper, we propose WabiQA, a novel system for automatically answering questions in the Thai language using the Thai Wikipedia articles as the knowledge source. Specifically, the proposed method first retrieves the Wikipedia article that is most likely to contain the answer. Then, a bidirectional LSTM model is used to read the article and locate candidate answers, which are ranked by confidence levels and returned to the user. WabiQA won the first prize award from Thailand's National Software Contest 2019 under category "Question-Answering Program from Thai Wikipedia," with 83.5%, 34.80%, and 45.96%, and outperforming the next best competitors' systems by 19.99, 24.26, and 33.10 percentage points in terms of Accuracy@1, EM, and F1 respectively. Furthermore, we also develop a prototype mobile application that aims to facilitate Thai users with visual impairment using voice-to-speech technology and an intelligent question-answer categorization. The findings of this research not only expand the horizon of the possibility to develop intelligent NLP applications for the Thai language using only available existing Thai NLP tools, resources, and deep learning technologies, but also shed light on the possibility to apply such techniques to develop many intelligent NLP tasks for the Thai and other low-resource languages such as reading assessment, writing assistance, and entity linking.

AB  - This paper identifies a number of factors involved in current practices of usability testing and presents profiles for three prototype methods: think-aloud, subjective ratings, and history files. We then identify ideal levels to generate the profile for new methods. These methods involve either a human observer or a self-administration of the test by the user. We propose methods of automating the evaluation form by dynamically adding items and modifying the form and the tasks in the process of the usability test. For self-administration of testing, we propose similar ideas of dynamically automating the forms and the tasks. Furthermore, we propose methods of eliciting the user's goals and focus of attention. Finally, we propose that user testing methods and interfaces should be subjected to usability testing. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Studies point to a relationship between fantasy sports/daily fantasy sports (DFS) play and gambling behavior. However, little is known about the nature of those relationships, particularly regarding the development of gambling problems. This study investigates the nature, frequency, and preferences of gambling behavior as well as problem gambling severity and comorbid conditions among DFS players. Data were collected from an epidemiologic survey of 3634 New Jersey residents on gambling and leisure activities. Participants were contacted by phone (land-line and cell) and online to obtain a representative, cross-sectional sample of non-institutionalized adults, aged 18 years or older. Excluding non-gamblers, the remaining 2146 participants, included in these analyses, indicated they had either played DFS (n = 299) or had gambled but not played DFS (1847) in the past year. Univariate comparisons and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the most significant characteristics and predictors of DFS players. Overall, a higher number of gambling activities, high frequency gambling, male gender, and reports of suicidal thoughts in the past year were most predictive of DFS players. Being Hispanic (vs. Caucasian) and/or single (vs. married or living with a partner) also doubled the odds of DFS play. Findings suggest that DFS players are characterized by high gambling frequency and problem severity and comorbid problems, notably suicidal ideation. Future research should examine the motivations and possible etiological sub-types of DFS players and the nature and course of DFS play, particularly in relation to gambling behavior and the development of gambling and other problems.

AB  - This article explores the integration of the mobile phone into the religious experience of Christians in Nigeria. Based on the results of an online survey and the author?s observation, it argues that the mobile phone has become an actant in the mediatization of religion, creating dependency among some users and transforming religious praxis in palpable ways. Unsurprisingly, perspectives vary on whether and how the phone should be used during worship. Attitudes coalesce around three viewpoints, leading to the emergence of user groups labelled critics, advocates, and dualists. The accounts of study participants give access into the ways some people seek to (re)configure their engagement with religion by inserting the mobile phone as a multifunctional techno-spiritual gadget.

AB  - Background: Feelings of loss, shame and stigmatization, reduced quality of life, isolation and loneliness are common among men and women with infertility. Fertility patients may seek peer mentoring and support, specifically through the use of online forums, to fulfil their needs for shared experience and guidance through the fertility treatment process. Objective: To assess the use and benefits of an online fertility-related peer support forum through two research questions: (1) do socio-demographics, stress, and anxiety differ between posters on the forum, lurkers who read messages but did not post, and people who chose not to use it?; and (2) how did forum users describe their experiences? Design: A sample of 220 male and female fertility patients aged 23–54 years old (M = 35.51, SD = 4.94) were recruited at fertility clinics in Montreal and Toronto, Canada, to test a mobile application called ‘Infotility’. They answered questionnaires before and after being given access to Infotility for eight weeks. The peer support forum was accessible through the Infotility dashboard. Main Outcome Measures: Psychological distress was measured through the 4-item Perceived Stress Scale and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item Scale. Experiences using the forum were assessed through open-ended questions and in-depth interviews. Results: Participants with heightened psychological distress were more likely to become posters rather than lurkers or non-users and reported less distress after using the forum. Forum users appreciated the opportunity to share their experiences with others in similar situations. Conclusion: The forum reduced loneliness and allowed participants to learn new ways to manage stress. It was particularly beneficial for those with heightened psychological distress.

AB  - Objectives: Previous research suggests that anticipation of incoming phone calls or messages and impulsivity are significantly associated with motor vehicle crash. We took a more explanative approach to investigate a conceptual model regarding the direct and indirect effect of compulsive cell phone use and impulsive personality traits on crash risk. Methods: We recruited a sample of 307 undergraduate college students to complete an online survey that included measures of cell phone use, impulsivity, and history of motor vehicle crash. Using a structural equation model, we examined the direct and indirect relationships between factors of the Cell Phone Overuse Scale-II (CPOS-II), impulsivity, in-vehicle phone use, and severity and frequency of previous motor vehicle crash. Self-reported miles driven per week and year in college were included as covariates in the model. Results: Our findings suggest that anticipation of incoming communication has a direct association with greater in-vehicle phone use, but was not directly or indirectly associated with increasing risk of previous motor vehicle crash. Of the three latent factors comprising the CPOS-II, only anticipation was significantly associated with elevated cell phone use while driving. Greater impulsivity and use of in-vehicle cell phone use while driving were directly and significantly associated with greater risk of motor vehicle crash. Conclusions: Anticipation of incoming cellular contacts (calls or texts) is associated with greater in-vehicle phone use, while greater in-vehicle cell phone use and impulsive traits are associated with elevated risk of motor vehicle crashes.

AB  - Transhumance is a resource efficient means of livestock production by seasonally moving grazing animals to utilize pastures between varying ecological zones. This article investigated the interrelationship between the environmental services the transhumant provides whilst maintaining its cultural heritage and theorized what the cultural and environmental impacts would be if the practice of transhumance were to vanish. The authors interviewed 45 transhumant families during their 2015 seasonal migration through the Taurus Mountains and in their settled tent sites in Central Anatolia. The interview topics related to geography of the region, migration routes, natural resource constraints and opportunities, animal husbandry, grazing strategies and their income sources. By practicing agro-ecological principles over millennia, the research showed that the transhumant has helped shape a complex mosaic of habitats in one of Mediterranean's most interesting ecosystems. The mobile pastoralist with conservation and natural resource management skills over a long period has reduced erosion control, improved soil quality and deterred the likelihood of forest fires, whilst weaving a resilient social web. The survey also indicated a clear link between social and ecological resilience emphasizing that sustainable development relies on the interconnectedness between biological and cultural diversity. The study recommends special provisions be made by the Turkish government for the educational needs for the children of the transhumant, provide initiatives for improved trading of their produce, introduce law enforcement for oppressive behavior against them and finally support the pastoralists to attain world heritage listing as a unique and an irreplaceable culture for the future welfare of humankind.

AB  - Recently, the idea of ?data fusion?, that is, of combining different types of data, became quite popular because of the advances of new technologies. In particular, several studies started investigating the possibility of combining survey data with other data types in order to get a more complete or accurate picture of the reality and/or to reduce survey burden. One key element, then, is the willingness of people to share different types of data, beyond survey answers. In this article, we investigate to what extent members from an opt-in online panel in Spain are willing to share different types of information that have in general not been studied before in the literature: records of their surrounding sound (audiotracking), information from their email inbox (in different ways, sharing the email credentials, using an email plug-in or redirecting emails, partially or totally), sensorial reactions measured by a wearable device (neuroscience) and public information about them available online. We use a choice-based conjoint analysis in order to study the level of willingness depending on the incentives offered in exchange, and we present the level of willingness by gender and age groups. Overall, we find huge differences in the level of willingness across data types. Increasing the incentives, on the contrary, does not improve the willingness so much, even if there is a positive trend. Some differences are observed across gender and age groups but most of them are not statistically significant.

AB  - Against the backdrop of an aging world population increasingly affected by a diverse range of abilities and disabilities as well as the rise of ubiquitous computing and digital app cultures, this paper questions how mobile technologies mediate between heterogeneous environments and sensing beings. To approach the current technological manufacturing of the senses, two lines of thought are of importance: First, there is a need to critically reflect upon the concept of assistive technologies (AT) as artifacts providing tangible solutions for a specific disability. Second, the conventional distinction between user and environment requires a differentiated consideration. This contribution will first review James Gibson's concept of "affordances" and modify this approach by introducing theories and methods of Science and Technology Studies (STS) and Actor-Network Theory (ANT). Then, we present two case studies where we explore the relations between recent "assistive" app technologies and human sensory perception. As hearing and seeing are key in this regard, we concentrate on two specific media technologies: ReSound LINX2, a hearing aid which allows for direct connect (via Bluetooth) with iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch, and Camassia, an IOS app for sonic wayfinding for blind people. We emphasize the significance of dis-/abling practices for manufacturing novel forms of hearing and seeing and drawing on sources like promotional materials by manufacturers, ads, or user testimonials and reviews. Our analysis is interested in the reciprocal relationships between users and their socio-technical and media environments. By and large, this contribution will provide crucial insights into the contemporary entanglement of algorithm-driven technologies, daily practices, and sensing subjects: the production of techno-sensory arrangements.

AB  - Navigate PD was an educational program established to supplement existing guidelines and provide recommendations on the management of Parkinson's disease (PD) refractory to oral/transdermal therapies. It involved 103 experts from 13 countries overseen by an International Steering Committee (ISC) of 13 movement disorder specialists. The ISC identified 71 clinical questions important for device-aided management of PD. Fifty-six experts responded to a web-based survey, rating 15 questions as ‘critically important;’ these were refined to 10 questions by the ISC to be addressed through available evidence and expert opinion. Draft guidance was presented at international/national meetings and revised based on feedback. Key take-home points are: 1. Patients requiring levodopa > 5 times daily who have severe, troublesome ‘off’ periods (> 1–2 h/day) despite optimal oral/transdermal levodopa or non-levodopa-based therapies should be referred for specialist assessment even if disease duration is < 4 years. 2. Cognitive decline related to non-motor fluctuations is an indication for device-aided therapies. If cognitive impairment is mild, use deep brain stimulation (DBS) with caution. For patients who have cognitive impairment or dementia, intrajejunal levodopa infusion is considered as both therapeutic and palliative in some countries. Falls are linked to cognitive decline and are likely to become more frequent with device-aided therapies. 3. Insufficient control of motor complications (or drug-resistant tremor in the case of DBS) are indications for device-aided therapies. Levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel infusions or subcutaneous apomorphine pump may be considered for patients aged > 70 years who have mild or moderate cognitive impairment, severe depression or other contraindications to DBS.

AB  - We implement an experiment to elicit subjects' ambiguity attitudes in the spirit of Ellsberg's three-color urn. The procedure includes three design elements that (together) have not been featured in similar experiments: strict ambiguity preferences, a single decision, and a mechanical randomization device with an unknown distribution (to both subjects and experimenters). We use this device in order to eliminate possible "strategic" ambiguity related to subjects' beliefs about the experimenters' motivations. In addition, we survey 40 experimental studies on Ellsberg's two- and three-color problems, and find that, on average, slightly more than half of subjects are classified as ambiguity averse. Our results, with our new design, fall on the low end of the range of results in the surveyed studies, and are comparable to a control test where "strategic" ambiguity was induced.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine the factors that influence social presence and user satisfaction with Mobile Instant Messaging (mIM). The proposed research model integrates channel expansion, social influence, social presence and media richness theories, to explain how user experience, social influence, and medium richness influence social presence and user satisfaction with mIM. A total of 239 students from a state university in the US participated in this study. Data was collected via a web-based survey. The results suggest that user experience, social influence, and perceived richness are important drivers for social presence and user satisfaction in mIM. The implications of the study findings are discussed in the paper. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Facilitated by advancement in technology, today, usage of mobile instant messaging (MIM) applications is a dominant global phenomenon that permeates every part of the world. This phenomenon results in drastic shift in customer attitude and behavior on how to connect and interact with others. MIM service has been replacing telecommunications operators (telcos)' short message service, and because third-party MIM applications are those gaining meaningful traction, this trend is threatening the telecommunications industry as it leads to losses in telcos' revenues. To cope with this onslaught of third-party MIM applications, telcos launched Joyn, their own MIM application. However, despite their similar technical characteristics, Joyn still lacks user traction. It is critical, therefore, to understand the antecedents to continuance use intention of MIM applications in both contexts. Based on the expanded expectation-confirmation model (ECM), the present research develops a benefit-confirmation model that examines the antecedents to continuance intention to use MIM applications, while provides a comparative analysis of two popular MIM applications in Korea KakaoTalk (third-party) and Joyn (telcos). A total of 467 data point were collected online. The structural equation modeling results of the total sample provide support for ECM-related hypotheses as well as for significant effects of net benefits and network benefits on continuance intention to use MIM applications, while the comparative analysis suggests that KakaoTalk's prominent features are hedonic in nature, whereas, Joyn's main attribute is its interoperability. The implications of these findings are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Smartphone cameras are increasingly used for document capture in daily life. To understand user behaviors, we performed two studies: (1) an online survey (n=106) to understand general smartphone camera usage behaviors related to information capture, as well as participants' experiences of orientation errors, and (2) a controlled lab study (n=16) to understand detailed document capture behaviors and to identify patterns in orientation errors. According to our online survey, 79.30% of the respondents reported experiencing orientation errors during document capture. In addition, our lab study showed that more than 90% of landscape capture tasks result in incorrect orientation. To solve this problem, we systematically analyzed the user behavior during document capture (e.g., video sequences and photographs taken or hand grip used) and propose a novel solution called ScanShot, which detects document capture time to help users correct orientation errors. ScanShot tracks the direction of gravity during document capture and monitors the users rotational or tilting movements of to update changes in orientation automatically. Our results confirm that document capture with 93.44% accuracy; in addition, our orientation update mechanism can reduce orientation errors by 92.85% using a gyroscope (for rotation) and 81.60% using an accelerometer (for micro-tilts).

AB  - This study addresses why Japanese teenagers participate in mobile-based word-of-mouth (WOM) campaigns. It is posited that commitment to the promoted brand, relationship with the mobile device, and group-person connectivity act as antecedents of two primary gratifications of the campaign, entertainment value and purposive value, which in turn determine the direction and strength of the attitude-intention-behavior chain. A 'real' mobile campaign was used as stimulus. Based on a random sampling method, 22,500 structured questionnaires were sent to young consumers, 13-18 years old, via mobile device. Our data fit the proposed model fairly well, and all hypothesized paths are supported. There are significant differences in the strength of the paths between teenagers who learned of the campaign from non-WOM sources (i.e., content-based Web sites and e-mail magazines) versus WOM sources (pass-along e-mail and direct referral). In closing, theoretical and managerial implications are discussed and important limitations are recognized. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Despite the growing importance of the online mobile gaming industry, little research has been undertaken to explain why consumers engage in this ubiquitous entertainment. This study attempts to develop an instrument to measure experiential value in online mobile gaming adoption. The proposed scale consists of seven first-order factors of experiential value: intrinsic enjoyment, escapism, efficiency, economic value, visual appeal, perceived novelty, and perceived risklessness. The survey obtained 164 usable responses from Japanese college students. The empirical data fit our first-order model well, indicating a high level of reliability as well as convergent and discriminant validity. The single second-order model also shows an acceptable model fit. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study examines the effects of online gossip propensity in social networking sites (SNSs). We posit that online gossip propensity affects SNS identification, which in turn determines normative pressure and SNS engagement. The ultimate outcome is electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) intention. We also explore the impact of two types of SNS communication channel, i.e. handheld (mobile devices and tablets) and traditional (desktop PCs and laptops) computing devices. The data were collected from a questionnaire survey with 400 general consumers. Using a scenario approach, we asked the respondents how they would react to a special discount campaign for a popular beer brand ad posted on an SNS. Our structural equation modelling results indicate that online gossip propensity is indeed a significant driver of SNS identification. All hypothesised paths are supported, except the one from normative pressure to eWOM intention. Furthermore, SNS communication channels had a clear impact, since the latent means are greater for most of the constructs in the handheld computing device group than in the traditional computing device group.

AB  - Drawing upon utility maximization theory, this study examines the consequences of quick response (QR) code mobile promotion in terms of information privacy concerns, defensive responses (intention to protect, fabricate, or withhold), and loyalty. Two contextual variables, social anxiety and situational involvement, are hypothesized as moderators. The main survey employs the scenario method with 667 general consumers in Japan. The results indicate that most of the main effects are supported for both moderators. There are strong interaction effects of social anxiety and situational involvement in intention to protect and intention to fabricate personal information. Our study suggests that QR code promotion is a practical and useful tool for loyalty, and its use may significantly depend on its context, whether physical or psychological.

AB  - Purpose - This study aims to identify distinct online media user segments on the basis of three media theories, namely media displacement theory, media complementarity theory and media richness theory
Design/methodology/approach - A largescale, mobile-based web survey was conducted in Japan to assess behavioural variables (media time allocation, media richness perceptions, and media access motives) and demographics
Findings - The latent class model reveals four distinct media user segments dual media users (i.e, users of the internet on both the mobile and the PC), mobile internet suers. PC internet users, and passive online users Dual media users are likely to spend more time on information searching, perceive greater levels of media richness in online media, and share common motives for accessing internet media via both mobile and PC The findings are consistent with our theoretical expectations
Research limitations and implications - Any exploratory clustering of consumers is by definition a snapshot that depends on time and place Consequently the findings would very likely have been different if the underlying data had been sampled at another time of in different locations Despite this limitation the findings corroborate some of the basic tenets of theories of media competition and complementarity
Practical implications - The fact that almost a third of online media users access internet content via both mobile and PC suggests the increasing importance of cross-media strategies
Originality/value - This is a pioneering study that examines media competitions and complementarity between the mobile internet and the PC internet

AB  - Survey research has long grappled with the concept of survey mode preference: the idea that a respondent may prefer to participate in one survey mode over another. This article experimentally examines the effect of mode preference on response, contact, and cooperation rates; mode choice; and data collection efficiency. Respondents to a 2008 telephone survey (n = 1,811; AAPOR RR3 = 38 percent) were asked their mode preference for future survey participation. These respondents were subsequently followed up in 2009 with two independent survey requests. The first follow-up survey request was another telephone survey (n = 548; AAPOR RR2 = 55.5 percent). In the second follow-up survey (n = 565; AAPOR RR2 = 46.0 percent), respondents were randomly assigned to one of four mode treatments: Web only, mail only, Web followed by mail, and mail followed by Web. We find that mode preference predicts participation in Web and phone modes, cooperation in phone mode (where contact and cooperation can be disentangled), and the selection of a mode when given the option of two modes. We find weak and mixed evidence about the relationship between mode preference and reduction of field effort. We discuss the important implications these findings have for mixed mode surveys.

AB  - Mobile devices facilitate the use of mobile services that are similar to services used via fixed Internet connections. The objective of this article is to assess displacement effects between fixed and mobile Internet services, and to research the role of technical capabilities of mobile handsets and demographics as moderators. This study is based on a sample of 628 respondents who have access to fixed and mobile Internet services. The respondents' usage of services was analyzed. An online questionnaire was used to collect data on the use of information, communication, entertainment, and transaction services. Mobile Internet reinforces, rather than replaces, Internet usage. When people possess an iPhone® or (mobile) laptop, this reinforcement effect is present for entertainment services. With respect to transaction services, the Blackberry® makes a stronger case. With the exception of gender, demographic characteristics do not have a moderating effect. Women display a stronger reinforcement effect than men in relation to transaction services. To the best of our knowledge, no study to date has investigated the displacement effects of fixed Internet services by the mobile handset. This empirical study contributes to the literature regarding the displacement effects of mobile Internet services. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The notion that digital-screen engagement decreases adolescent well-being has become a recurring feature in public, political, and scientific conversation. The current level of psychological evidence, however, is far removed from the certainty voiced by many commentators. There is little clear-cut evidence that screen time decreases adolescent well-being, and most psychological results are based on single-country, exploratory studies that rely on inaccurate but popular self-report measures of digital-screen engagement. In this study, which encompassed three nationally representative large-scale data sets from Ireland, the United States, and the United Kingdom (N = 17,247 after data exclusions) and included time-use-diary measures of digital-screen engagement, we used both exploratory and confirmatory study designs to introduce methodological and analytical improvements to a growing psychological research area. We found little evidence for substantial negative associations between digital-screen engagement-measured throughout the day or particularly before bedtime-and adolescent well-being.

AB  - When used in a mobile ecosystem, social Web applications are commonly criticized due to their poor quality. We believe this is accounted for by the inadequacy of current approaches for their evaluation as well as the lack of suitable quality models. With an objective to address the aforementioned issues, this paper introduces a quality model that captures the particularities of social Web applications when used on mobile devices. Drawing on the comprehensive literature review, a finite set of performance variables (items, attributes, and categories) that contribute to the mobile quality of social Web applications was identified and subsequently employed for the purpose of designing a conceptual model in the form of a mobile quality requirements tree. An empirical study was then carried out to assess the reliability and validity of the conceptual model and pertaining measuring instrument. During the study, participants accomplished predefined scenarios of interaction with a representative sample of social Web applications for collaborative writing and evaluated their mobile quality by completing the post-use questionnaire. An analysis of data collected from end users uncovered a relevance of performance variables at different levels of granularity in a mobile quality requirements tree as well as pros and cons of evaluated collaborative editors.

AB  - Access to information via handheld devices supports decision making away from one's computer. However, limitations include small screens and constrained wireless bandwidth. We present a summarization method that transforms online content for delivery to small devices. Unlike previous algorithms, ours assumes nothing about document formatting, and induces a hierarchical structure based on the relative importance of sentences within the document. As compared to delivering full documents, the method reduces the bytes transferred by half. An experiment also demonstrates that when given hierarchical summaries, users are no less accurate in answering questions about the documents. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The challenges include (1) memory errors and biases when reporting everyday news media consumption leading to (2) errors when linking mass media outlets to survey data; (3) personalization of media content, as well as (4) short-term dynamic processes. Mobile Intensive Longitudinal Linkage Analysis (MILLA) uses an innovative combination of smartphone data donations to capture media exposure and relevant media content, a mobile experience sampling questionnaire to capture immediate reactions to news, and the content analysis of uploaded news media content to measure media effects. The design is explained by using an example of negativity in the news and its effects on emotional reactions of recipients.

AB  - In 2013 the Mexican Telecommunications and Broadcasting Reform was launched with the goal of promoting competition and access in the telecommunications sector. The aim of this paper is to evaluate whether the 2013 reform had an impact on household fixed internet adoption and to what extent Mexican households, classified into ten wealth groups, had adopted intemet. For the assessment, after a revision of supply and demand Reform's measures to reduce the digital divide, data from the 2010 Census and 2015 Intercensal Survey were used to create adoption indexes using Poisson estimations. The results were analyzed by ten wealth groups, constructed on principal components based on household characteristics (type of dwelling, electricity availability, availability of drinking water, sewer system, intemet and ICT devices: computer, telephone, cell phone and intemet). Additionally, the impact of both indexes was validated by a difference in differences method. The results suggest a 66% overall increase in intemet adoption between 2010 and 2015. The decile analysis showed considerable intemet adoption in the low and middle wealth groups (deciles 2-8), while in the highest wealth groups (deciles 9-10) the impact of internet adoption has been relatively moderate. It is worth noting that interne adoption is unequally distributed, as less than 1% of households in deciles 1 to 6 had adopted internet in 2015, while nearly all of the wealthiest ten percent of households have intemet access. Nevertheless the increment in interne adoption was not only the result of the reform but the combination of the broadband penetration trend and the reform together.

AB  - Mobile phone distracted driving has been identified as a significant contributor to road trauma. The use of voluntary smartphone applications (or mobile phone functions) which are designed to prevent certain phone behaviours while driving is an emerging countermeasure for distracted driving. Despite the potential for voluntary smartphone applications to reduce crashes associated with mobile phone distracted driving, there has been limited research assessing how effective these applications are in reducing mobile phone use while driving, and the perceived acceptance of such applications. The overall aim of this study is to investigate factors that influence the use of voluntary smartphone applications to reduce the distraction associated with mobile phone use while driving. A total of 712 drivers from Australia participated in an online questionnaire about their preferences and opinions regarding smartphone applications to prevent mobile phone distracted driving. Statistical analyses including a random-effects logistic regression model were conducted to analyse the impact of the application functions on the participants' willingness to install and activate the application. The willingness of participants to install and activate a mobile phone app was determined by the facility to disable visual-manual tasks and notifications and allow hands-free conversations. The facility to set up automatic responses to inform contacts that they are driving was also important. Females were significantly more likely to install and activate the app. Preferred functions included the blocking of visual-manual interactions such as texting and browsing but allowing applications that support driving such as GPS and Bluetooth. Participants also wanted to retain the ability to use music-playing functions. The ability to give commands to the phone exclusively through audio using a hands-free device or Bluetooth was also favoured. Some age-related differences were evident when examining preferred functions. Overall, findings suggest that the use of app-based technology is a potential intervention opportunity to reduce exposure to high-risk behaviours among motorists and particularly young drivers.

AB  - Driver visual distraction due to the prevalence of mobile phone engagement has become a major safety concern for transport authorities worldwide. Despite long-term efforts to prevent engagement in mobile phone tasks, drivers continue to use their phones while driving. To develop better policy and prevention practices, gaining an understanding of the predictors and strategies utilised by drivers who use their mobile phone for distracting tasks is necessary. Visually intensive tasks are the main interest of this investigation, e.g., texting and browsing. In an online questionnaire in Queensland (Australia), of the 484 drivers who participated, a 33.5% (n = 162) of respondents reported using a mobile phone for texting and browsing while driving on a typical day. Answers from these participants were analysed for this study. Negative binomial regression was used to model the effect of the independent variables (personal characteristics, perceived crash risk, beliefs, workload management strategies, and police avoidance strategies) over the rate of texting/browsing events per hour driving. The final statistical model confirmed that drivers who reported previous collisions; who believed that the effects of doing the texting/browsing task would last after it was finished; and who reported keeping their phone low to avoid police had an increased texting/browsing incidence rate. Comparably, drivers who held a valid driving license for longer; who perceived larger crash risk regarding texting/browsing behaviour; who avoided mobile phone use in demanding driving conditions; and who used workload management strategies such as reduced speed when engaged in mobile phone use had a reduced texting/browsing incidence rate. The results provide insights into the limitations of actual enforcement control and potential opportunities for countermeasures.

AB  - Digital mobile communication tools have become cultural artefacts for everyday sociability. As technology use becomes pervasive in society, it brings many advantages for everyday social relations, but these benefits come in tandem with some disadvantages and unintended consequences. One such consequence is the tendency for people to be distracted due to technology use while driving. The focus of this study was to explore the prevalence of texting, making phone calls, and other technology use, such as adjusting or tuning dashboard music players or radios, while driving. Through a survey of drivers, roadside ethnographic observations of drivers, and interviews with traffic officers in Polokwane, Limpopo, South Africa, the study broadly examined the social and cultural impact of technology and mobility with specific focus on technology use and distracted driving. The findings revealed a prevalence for texting and driving: 60 per cent of the participants reported that they have sent a text while driving; and 88 per cent acknowledged that they have seen drivers texting while driving. The study is significant considering the limited research on this social issue in South Africa, and it is also relevant considering that technology use and distraction portends the potential for causing road accidents.

AB  - Purpose
Based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2), the purpose of this study was to examine users' continued usage intention of mobile event application (MEA) technology.
Design/methodology/approach
A self-administered online survey was used to collect the study data from 407 MEA users, and structural equation modeling was used to test the study's hypotheses.
Findings
The study's results revealed that users' continued usage behavior was positively influenced by effort expectancy, performance expectancy, habit, facilitating condition and perceived security. The study's results further indicated that personal innovativeness had a positive impact on effort expectancy and performance expectancy.
Practical implications
The findings of the current study deliver important practical implications for event organizers and event technology vendors for identifying factors affecting MEA users' continued usage intention.
Originality/value
By extending UTAUT2, the current study is one of the first studies that examined users' intention to continue to use MEA technology.

AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate the determinants for the intention to adopt mobile technology as a data collection methodology in market research projects. A conceptual framework was developed using the technology-organization-environment (TOE) model to identify technological factors (perceived benefits and limitations), organizational factors (open attitude toward change, professional competence, satisfaction with traditional systems, and firm size), and environmental factors (industry pressure, client pressure, and participant pressure) affecting adoption. The empirical study was performed with data from 67 firms in the Spanish market research industry, which were analyzed using partial least squares (PLS). The results suggest that only organizational and environmental factors have a significant influence on adoption. Key factors include professional competence, organizational openness, satisfaction with traditional and online methodologies, and pressure from industry, clients and survey participants. The findings reveal that technological characteristics are no longer a driver, as firms are starting to adopt mobile marketing research based on its greater convenience for participants, and as an element of strategic differentiation.

AB  - Background: A nationwide survey of family members of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities ranging in age from birth through adulthood was conducted to replicate a similar effort by Wehmeyer and update the knowledge base concerning technology use by people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Method: Survey responses provided information about use of technology for mobility, hearing and vision, communication, independent living, and in the area of computer use. In addition, survey items queried the use of electronic and information technology devices such as use of email, mobile telephones and digital cameras. Results: Survey results showed that although the use of computers for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities is more prevalent, other technology use frequency is much the same as in the late 1990s. However, technology needs did vary among school-age individuals over time. Conclusion: Implications of results for technology use of people with disabilities are discussed through the lens of frequency of use and needs for individuals with disabilities.

AB  - This study examined the effect of mobile operator promotions (MOP) on customer purchase intentions using longitudinal survey data (over two phases in a two-year period) from mobile phone consumers in South Korea. Results indicated that MOP led indirectly to repurchase intentions, but moderated mediation effects varied across time points. MOP appears primarily to moderate brand attitudes, which strongly influence repurchase intentions. Specifically, the direct effect appears between purchase intentions at time T and repurchase intentions at T + 1; however, the moderating influence of MOP is limited in these timeframes.

AB  - Nepali information and communication technology (ICT) policies, informed by dominant international discourses on internet and ICT for development, have attributed a ?self-evident? positive impact to economic growth. Such a conception is inconclusive and hides the underlying socioeconomic inequalities and the barriers they oppose to universal connectivity ambitions. The self-evident discourse overlooks the importance of adjacent infrastructures like electricity, critical for efficient functioning of a ?digital society?. History has shown Nepal?s eagerness to buy the irrational exuberance of the dot-com era. It also shows policy targets were not based on local evidence and experiences. While the question about when the next bubble will emerge and burst is debatable, the techno-deterministic arguments need to be checked in light of evidence. We offer insights from import trajectories since the drafting of the first IT policy. The proliferation of mobile phones is explored in light of data consumption (i.e., usage) and access during the deadly earthquake in 2015. The evidence clearly highlights the mismatch between connectivity ambitions and socioeconomic realities in a stratified information society. We contend that the self-evident visions of connectivity need to be checked empirically. We call for internet and ICT policies that have a nuanced conceptualisation of access and its gradation.

AB  - This study examines factors influencing adoption and use of computer-based voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) phone service and attempts to integrate 2 theoretical approaches: the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the uses and gratifications framework. Using data from an online survey of VoIP users (N = 420), structural equation modeling analyses revealed that perceived ease of use had a significant impact on perceived usefulness. In addition, perceived usefulness had a positive effect on actual VoIP use. The study further discovered that motivations for communication and instrumental use significantly affected perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and actual VoIP use. This study suggests that integration of TAM and uses and gratifications can be fruitful in understanding user acceptance of new communication technologies.

AB  - This paper assesses how use of smartphones relates to exposure to heterogeneity, political efficacy, and political engagement and suggests a new mediation model that can be applied to mobile communication. Drawing on online survey data collected during the 2012 presidential election in South Korea, this study finds that exposure to heterogeneity and political efficacy jointly mediate the impact of informational uses of smartphones on political participation. The current study also shows that informational uses of smartphones are significantly related to encounters with heterogeneity, political efficacy, and participatory behaviors. Additionally, recreational uses of smartphones were found to have a positive association with exposure to heterogeneity. However, relational uses of smartphones were not associated with democratic outcomes. The findings suggest that smartphones, by increasing the possibility of encountering diversity and subsequently enhancing political efficacy, create an additional pathway to citizen engagement in democratic processes.

AB  - This article investigates whether Twitter use motivations relate to exposure to discordant information. To this end, this research conducted an online survey of 1,350 adults of South Korea. The results reveal that using Twitter for information-seeking, public-expression, and leisure-seeking purposes helps users to encounter crosscutting exposure, while the use of Twitter for private expression does not. Offline network diversity has a significant association with crosscutting exposure, and it moderates the relationship between Twitter use for public expression or leisure seeking and crosscutting exposure. The positive association between Twitter use for leisure seeking and crosscutting exposure is stronger among younger people than among older people.

Based on a Web survey of 1,230 South Korean voters, it finds that informational uses of SNSs are positively associated with expressive participation both online and offline, but not with collective participation. The use of SNSs for social interaction purposes was associated only with online expressive participation. Recreational uses had a negative or insignificant relationship with expressive and collective participation. Political efficacy moderated the impact of social interaction uses of SNSs on expressive participation both online and offline. The findings suggest that the political impact of SNSs is mostly limited to expressive participation and dependent upon users' motivations.

AB  - This study proposes an integrated research model for investigating driver adoption of car navigation systems. We consider the potential causal connections between core cognitive and psychological factors and driver intention to use these systems. We extracted possible factors that may significantly affect the perceived usability of car navigation systems from in-depth interviews with two groups of individuals: an expert group and a driver group. Data collected from N = 1045 drivers via an online survey were analysed by structural equation modelling. The results showed that the service & display quality components of the systems were the most significant determinants of driver attitude and intention to use car navigation systems. Two other factors, namely attitude and perceived usefulness, also had impacts on driver intention. Moreover, both satisfaction and service & display quality were affected by perceived system reliability, while usefulness was affected by both perceived locational accuracy and satisfaction. Satisfaction also significantly affected perceived ease of use. In addition, we introduced new external variables to the technology acceptance model (TAM) and validated the causal connections proposed by the original TAM. The present study provides valuable insights into the core factors that significantly affect driver perspectives of and intention to use car navigation systems.

AB  - Tablet personal computers (tablet PCs) are popular electronic devices worldwide. They influence many aspects of our social lives. Compared with laptop computers, tablet PCs feature characteristics including enhanced portability and display quality. The purposes of this study were to examine users' attitudes toward tablet personal computers and identify the effects of external factors. This study extended the technology acceptance model and used perceived mobility and viewing experience as the external variables in the proposed model. This study used a web-based survey of 511 participants and found that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use were key determinants of attitude toward tablet personal computers. Also, the perceived ease of use and usefulness of tablet PCs were significantly enhanced by perceived mobility and viewing experience. In addition, all traditional relationships from the origin technology acceptance model were supported. Lastly, both implications of the study and areas of future research are discussed.

AB  - With an integrated framework, this paper aims to analyze user perception and acceptance toward long-term evolution (LTE) services, focusing on factors that may influence the intention to use. We conducted a web-based survey of 1,192 users to test our research model. We employed structural equation modeling (SEM) as the analysis method. The results of the integrated model analysis indicate that system satisfaction is a core determinant of intention to use LTE services. The model also found that other factors, including perceived usefulness and system and service quality, significantly affect intention to use these services. In addition, both perceived adaptivity and processing speed significantly influence perceived usefulness and service quality, respectively. These factors also play key roles in determining users' attitudes. This paper is of value to researchers and engineers designing and improving LTE services for use via mobile phones.

AB  - Mobile radio frequency identification (RFID) services are expected to be launched in full-scale as a new service option in the telecommunications service market following the development of RFID technology and maturation of the IT infrastructure. Importance of customer loyalty has been widely recognized in business marketing for a long time, and the customer loyalty enhancement strategies for mobile RFID services is of significance to telecommunication carriers in terms of new business value creation. This study identifies the factors affecting customer loyalty for mobile RFID services and presents telecommunication service managers with information useful for improving customer loyalty for related new services. The data was collected from customers with some experience in the use of mobile RFID services through an online survey for an empirical analysis. And the collected data was analysed with structural equation model to verify the cause and effect relationship among perceived quality, switching cost, perceived value, customer satisfaction, switching barrier and customer relationship. The analysis showed that the quality of tag recognition and content quality proved to have a direct impact on the customer satisfaction, whereas connection quality and ease of use would rather indirectly than directly influence customer satisfaction by perceived value. Perceived value and satisfaction affected the loyalty. Adaptation cost affects switching barriers, the higher the switching barriers, the stronger the loyalty. Based on the results of the empirical analysis, practical implications were given. What is more, mobile RFID customers were divided into two groups that are favourably and unfavourably disposed toward the service, and suggested customer loyalty improvement strategies adapted for each group.

AB  - One of the ubiquitous technology fields that have received the most attention recently from technology communities worldwide is mobile radio frequency identification (RFID). Mobile handsets loaded with RFID readers enable the identification and retrieval of information on RFID tagged objects. In Korea, a variety of mobile RFID services are currently being piloted, and their commercial roll-out looks imminent. The goal of this study is to propose, ahead of the commercial launch of mobile RFID services, a customer satisfaction index (CSI) model for this service category and to then measure the CSI to derive practical implications for their providers and pointers related to the improvement of service. A web survey was conducted on Korean mobile phone subscribers who had participated in a mobile RFID pilot program. Using the results of this survey, we tested the CSI model and its hypotheses by employing a partial least-squares-based structural equation model analysis and calculated the index. We further conducted an importance-performance analysis in order to provide insights that may be useful for improving the quality of mobile RFID services.

AB  - The digital revolution and the ongoing dissemination of mobile phones carry several prospects for smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. Food insecurity and low dietary quality remain major issues among African smallholders. Mobile phones could potentially facilitate access to food markets and thus improve food security and nutrition, but research on such types of effects remains scarce. In this study, we analyze whether mobile phones improve dietary quality among pastoral communities in Northern Kenya. We use six rounds of household panel data covering the period between 2009 and 2015. During this period, mobile phone ownership in the sample increased from less than 30% to more than 70%. Regression models with household fixed effects allow robust estimation while reducing potential issues of unobserved heterogeneity. The estimates show that mobile phone adoption and use are positively and significantly associated with dietary diversity. The effects are particularly large for frequent mobile phone users. We also examine the underlying mechanisms. Mobile phone use improves dietary diversity mainly through better access to purchased foods. These results encourage the promotion of mobile phone technologies as a valuable tool for nutritional improvements, especially in remote rural settings with poor access to food markets.

AB  - The quality of online information is highly variable because anyone can post data on the internet, and not all online sources are equally reliable, valuable, or accurate. Previous studies reveal problems with online information evaluation skills and a lack of ability in using evaluation criteria, including currency, relevance, authority, accuracy and purpose. The primary purpose of this study is to develop a framework for cooperative and interactive mobile learning to improve students' online information evaluation skills. A mobile learning application is subsequently developed based on the proposed framework. To assess the effectiveness of the developed application, an experiment is conducted on diploma students in a university. A usability questionnaire is conducted on an experimental group to identify students' perceptions regarding the usability of the developed mobile application. The experimental results indicate that the application is significantly more effective with an effect size of 1.91 in improving students’ online information evaluation skills than traditional learning. The results contribute to the extant literature in the context of mobile learning by identifying usability evaluation features and providing a framework for developing cooperative and interactive mobile learning. The implications of the present findings for research and instructional practice are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The advent of mobile technologies in learning context, has been increased the requirements for developing appropriate usability model to align with mobile learning applications. Even though mobile learning has been studied from different aspects of pedagogy environment and technology acceptance, there is little scientific and published research on usability of mobile learning applications. To fill up the gap, in this study, a usability evaluation model with the inclusion of timeliness is developed to assess the usability of mobile learning applications. Timeliness or response time as an important feature in mobile learning, which influences learning satisfaction, can be considered to evaluate the peers and instructors' timely response. The main objective of this study is to construct and validate a usability evaluation survey for mobile learning environments. This study employed a two round Delphi method to empirically verify the usability questionnaire by obtaining a consensus from fourteen experts regarding the questionnaire items. Results indicate that over 88% of experts have consented on all usability items represented in the usability questionnaire. The usability evaluation survey for mobile learning applications can help to improve user satisfaction and reductions in training costs. The decrease in costs attracts many researchers, interface designers and project managers to employ the usability evaluation when designing the interfaces for mobile learning applications.

AB  - The aim of this research was to explore the role of Schwartz's ten universal human values in the context of using products and services. Seventy-five participants were asked to qualitatively describe a product or service especially well in line with their values and a product or service in conflict with their values, and to evaluate them on a number of rating scales. The scales included 30 statements (three statements per universal value) probing the presence of each value in user experiences related to products and services and 10 statements studying the perceived importance of each value. The results showed that all the ten universal values were relevant in the evaluations of products and services both in line with the users' values and in conflict with the users' values. In the current sample, hedonism and self-direction were rated as the values most frequently present and most important in the evaluations of products and services in line with values. Power was rated as a moderately important value for products in conflict with values, but significantly less important for products in line with values. Achievement values were frequently reported in the qualitative descriptions, but they were less prominent in the quantitative data. The results suggest that the model of ten universal values is promising in understanding the role of users' value preferences in using products and services, and it seems to have potential for complementing the psychological needs approach in understanding user experience.

AB  - The pervasive use of mobile information technologies brings new patterns of media usage, but also challenges to the measurement of media exposure. Researchers wishing to, for example, understand the nature of selective exposure on algorithmically driven platforms need to precisely attribute individuals’ exposure to specific content. Prior research has used tracking data to show that survey-based self-reports of media exposure are critically unreliable. So far, however, little effort has been invested into assessing the specific biases of tracking methods themselves. Using data from a multimethod study, we show that tracking data from mobile devices is linked to systematic distortions in self-report biases. Further inherent but unobservable sources of bias, along with potential solutions, are discussed.

AB  - Recent developments in medical informatics research have afforded possibilities for great advances in health care delivery. These exciting opportunities also present formidable challenges to the implementation and integration of technologies in the workplace. As in most domains, there is a gulf between technologic artifacts and end users. Since medical practice is a human endeavor, there is a need for bridging disciplines to enable clinicians to benefit from rapid technologic advances. This in turn necessitates a broadening of disciplinary boundaries to consider cognitive and social factors pertaining to the design and use of technology. The authors argue for a place of prominence for cognitive science. Cognitive science provides a framework for the analysis and modeling of complex human performance and has considerable applicability to a range of issues in informatics. Its methods have been employed to illuminate different facets of design and implementation. This approach has also yielded insights into the mechanisms and processes involved in collaborative design. Cognitive scientific methods and theories are illustrated in the context of two examples that examine human-computer interaction in medical contexts and computer-mediated collaborative processes. The framework outlined in this paper can be used to refine the process of iterative design, end-user training, and productive practice.

AB  - Background: The electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) JUUL has quickly captured the ENDS market, representing 74.6% of the total dollar share for this category as of November 2018. Although JUUL is marketed as an alternative to cigarettes intended for current adult smokers, evidence suggests that a majority of ENDS users are concurrently current cigarette smokers. Little is known about the dual use of JUUL and cigarettes, as well as the reasons for trying JUUL among adult tobacco users. Methods: A survey fielded via web and phone of 1332 current cigarette, cigar, little cigar or cigarillo (CLCC), and ENDS users aged 18–54 years was conducted from March to May 2018. Weighted descriptive and bivariate analyses examined JUUL use and reasons for trying JUUL by demographics, combustible tobacco use, ENDS use and intention to quit. Results: Approximately 81% of our sample reported current use of two or more tobacco products, including cigarettes, CLCCs or ENDS. Among current tobacco users, 15% ever used JUUL and 12% used JUUL in the past 30 days. Most individuals (74%) reporting ever JUUL use indicated using it for 5 days or fewer in the past 30 days. The most common reason for trying JUUL was trying to quit smoking cigarettes (37%), followed by family, friends or colleagues using the product (32%). Conclusion: Although some tobacco users may be initiating JUUL to decrease combustible use, most were using the product infrequently and concurrently with other products. Findings have significant implications for cessation intervention efforts and policy development to help smokers quit. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The national Monitoring the Future (MTF) study examines substance use among adolescents and adults in the United States and has used paper questionnaires since it began in 1975. The current experiment tested three conditions as compared to the standard MTF follow-up protocol (i.e., MTF Control) for the first MTF follow-up survey at ages 19/20 years (i.e., one or two years after high school graduation). The MTF Control group included participants who completed in-school baseline surveys in the 12th grade in 2012-2013 and who were selected to participate in the first follow-up survey in 2014 (n = 2,451). A supplementary sample of participants who completed the 12th grade baseline survey in 2012 or 2013 but were not selected to participate in the main MTF follow-up (n = 4,950) were recruited and randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions: (1) Mail Push, (2) Web Push, (3) Web Push + E-mail. Results indicated that the overall response rate was lower in Condition 2 compared to MTF Control and to Condition 1; there were no differences between Condition 3 and other conditions. Web response was highest in Condition 3; among web responders, smartphone response was also highest in Condition 3. Subgroup differences also emerged such that, for example, compared to white participants, Hispanics had greater odds of web (versus paper) response and blacks had greater odds of smartphone (versus computer or tablet) response. Item nonresponse was lowest in the Web Push conditions (compared to MTF Control) and on the web survey (compared to paper). Compared to MTF Control, Condition 3 respondents reported higher rates of alcohol use in the past 30 days. The total cost was lowest for Condition 3. Overall, the Condition 3 Web Push + E-mail design is promising. Future research is needed to continue to examine the implications of web and mobile response in large, national surveys.

AB  - The rise in the network society might lead to a decline in face-to-face contact as people substitute it with more mediated forms, or an increase in both face-to-face and mediated contact as complements, with unknown consequences for social support. This article examines trends in social contact, mediated contact (phone, online, etc.), and social support in 2002, 2006 and 2010, using aggregated ABS General Social Survey data. Results show an aggregate decline in face-to-face contact and rise in mediated contact in Australia between 2002 and 2010, but no aggregate decline in perceived social support, and a strong positive individual-level association between both forms of contact and social support. There are, however, signs of an emerging class-based digital divide, with low-income older men and less educated respondents reporting lower levels of mediated contact and social support by 2010.

AB  - With the increasing penetration of mobile phones and the internet in India, citizen journalism has experienced a steady growth in recent years. This paper adds to the growing scholarship on citizen journalism by exploring the motivations of Indian citizen journalists to produce online news content. Through a Web-based survey of citizen journalists (<italic>N</italic> = 134) contributing to the leading news portals in India, this study addresses the role of traditional media experience among citizen journalists’ reporting practices. One of the key findings of this study is that, unlike American citizen journalists, Indian citizen journalists who have not worked in traditional media are less likely to work collaboratively than those with traditional media experience.

AB  - Previous research has highlighted age-related differences in social perception, in particular emotional expression processing. To date, such studies have largely focused on approaches that use static emotional stimuli that the participant has to identify passively without the possibility of any interaction. In this study, we propose an interactive virtual environment to better address age-related variations in social and emotional perception. A group of 22 young (18–30 years) and 20 older (60–80 years) adults were engaged in a face-to-face conversation with an embodied conversational agent. Participants were invited to interact naturally with the agent and to identify his facial expression. Their gaze behaviour was captured by an eye-tracking device throughout the interaction. We also explored whether the Big Five personality traits (particularly extraversion) and anxiety modulated gaze during the social interaction. Findings suggested that age-related differences in gaze behaviour were only apparent when decoding social signals (i.e., listening to a partner’s question, identifying facial expressions) and not when communicating social information (i.e., when speaking). Furthermore, higher extraversion levels consistently led to a shorter amount of time gazing towards the eyes, whereas higher anxiety levels led to slight modulations of gaze only when participants were listening to questions. Face-to-face conversation with virtual agents can provide a more naturalistic framework for the assessment of online socio-emotional interaction in older adults, which is not easily observable in classical offline paradigms. This study provides novel and important insights into the specific circumstances in which older adults may experience difficulties in social interactions.

AB  - The advent of online games, crowdsourcing, and user-generated content has led to the emergence of a new paradigm called the Human Computation Games (HCGs) which utilize games as a motivator to encourage users' participation in human computation. HCGs are different from games for pure entertainment which emphasize play and fun, rather than output generation. Therefore, research has yet to fully explore the factors underlying players' perception of HCG enjoyment. In this paper, we study the influence of motivational needs satisfaction and perceived output quality on perceived HCG enjoyment using a survey (N = 205) of a location-based information sharing HCG called SPLASH, developed as part of our research. According to the results, perceived needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness influence perceived enjoyment of HCGs, suggesting that HCGs that fulfill these three needs are more likely to be enjoyable, thereby encouraging players to make useful computations. The results also show that participants who perceive higher levels output relevancy report a greater level of enjoyment, indicating that HCGs that assist players in generating relevant outputs are more likely to be perceived as enjoyable.

AB  - "Technology" is lately equated with hardware and software, but for the Ancient Greeks, a technology combined two linked features: the doing of an art/craft (techne) and theorizing about the doing (technologia). We thus consider a "technology" as a "sociotechnical system" - an entanglement of humans with one another, the tools, arts, crafts, practices and institutionalized forms of life of their time. Writing systems and new media are each relevant to understanding the roles of technologies in development, considered at an ontogenetic or historical level. We consider two ostensibly conflicting claims by Piaget that lead to the question of how the postnatal environment fundamentally differs from the intrauterine environment and how this difference changes the process of development. Vygotsky's focus on the cultural/historical mediation of social relations helps us understand the dynamic interplay of technology and development as part of a single process of human development - and to resolve Piaget's multifaceted views. To illustrate the insights offered by our cultural-historical approach, we compare the ancient period coupled with the development of literacy/numeracy and current historical circumstances in which new digital technologies are the focus. These two cases illuminate ways current changes are replaying in new circumstances a developmental process as old as Homo sapiens. (C) 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Objective: The study aims were to identify: i.) energy drink (ED), caffeine tablet, and caffeine intranasal spray use amongst a sample who report drug use, and ii.) the association between ED use frequency and demographic profile, drug use, hazardous drinking, and wellbeing. Method: Participants (n = 74,864) who reported drug use completed the online 2014 Global Drug Survey. They provided data on demographics, ED use, and alcohol and drug use, completed the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and Personal Wellbeing Index (PWI), and reported whether they wished to reduce alcohol use. Results: Lifetime ED, caffeine tablet and intranasal caffeine spray use were reported by 69.2%, 24.5% and 4.9%. Median age of ED initiation was 16 years. For those aged 16–37, median years using EDs increased from 4 to 17 years of consumption, where it declined thereafter. Greater ED use frequency was associated with: being male; under 21 years of age; studying; and past year caffeine tablet/intranasal spray, tobacco, cannabis, amphetamine, MDMA, and cocaine use. Past year, infrequent (1–4days) and frequent (≥5days) past month ED consumers reported higher AUDIT scores and lower PWI scores than lifetime abstainers; past month consumers were less likely to report a desire to reduce alcohol use. Conclusions: ED use is part of a complex interplay of drug use, alcohol problems, and poorer personal wellbeing, and ED use frequency may be a flag for current/future problems. Prospective research is required exploring where ED use fits within the trajectory of other alcohol and drug use. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - While recent research has documented a rapid increase in the use of new technologies such as touchscreen tablets early in life, little is known about how young children use tablets, what activities they engage in, and whether family demographic and maternal well-being are associated with early use. Guided by Bronfenbrenner's bioecological theory of human development, the current study addressed these questions with a cross-sectional, online survey of mothers with children between 12 and 48 months of age. Mothers reported on their child's tablet use as well as their own personal well-being (depressive symptoms and role overload) and relational well-being (relationship satisfaction, coparenting quality, conflict frequency). Nearly 63 % of all mothers owned a tablet. Approximately 46 % of children with access typically use a tablet in an average day, with the majority using for 15 min or less. For families who owned a tablet, child's frequency of use was positively associated with child's age and mother's use and negatively associated with mother's relational well-being. Despite the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation that screen media be avoided for children under 24 months, children in our study used tablets, albeit infrequently. Our findings suggest that it is important for researchers to consider the relationship between contextual factors within the family and child media use. Refining their focus for families with particular needs may allow child advocates and policy makers to develop more beneficial media recommendations for families with a variety of circumstances.

AB  - This paper provides an overview of the e-book publishing industry in China and its changing business models. As the conventional publishing industry has continued to contract, digitization is becoming increasingly popular. Although China is an influential developing country undergoing rapid change, a dearth of research on its digital publishing industry exists at the present time. This article therefore explores two main research questions: (1) What are the recent trends and business models of digital publishing in China? (2) How might we evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of such business models? To this end, multiple case studies are employed, as is the paradigm of structure-conduct-performance (SCP). It is proposed that Content plus App and Content plus Device are the basic business models for Chinese digital content producers and distributors. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Purpose: Electronic cigarettes (e cigarettes) are a new type of device that delivers vaporized nicotine without the tobacco combustion of regular cigarettes. We sought to understand aware ness of and willingness to try e cigarettes among adolescent males, a group that is at risk for smoking initiation and may use e cigarettes as a 'gateway' to smoking. Methods: A national sample of 11-19 year old males (n = 228) completed an online survey in November 2011. We recruited participants through their parents, who were members of a panel of U.S. households constructed using random digit dialing and addressed based sampling. Results: Only two participants (< 1%) had previously tried e cigarettes. Among those who had not tried e cigarettes, most (67%) had heard of them. Awareness was higher among older and non Hispanic adolescents. Nearly 1 in 5 (18%) participants were willing to try either a plain or flavored e cigarette, but willingness to try plain versus flavored varieties did not differ. Smokers were more willing to try any e cigarette than nonsmokers (74% vs. 13%; OR 10.25, 95% CI 2.88, 36.46). Nonsmokers who had more negative beliefs about the typical smoker were less willing to try e cigarettes (OR .58, 95% CI .43, .79). Conclusions: Most adolescent males were aware of e cigarettes, and a substantial minority were willing to try them. Given that even experimentation with e cigarettes could lead to nicotine dependence and subsequent use of other tobacco products, regulatory and behavioral interventions are needed to prevent 'gateway' use by adolescent nonsmokers. Campaigns promoting negative images of smokers or FDA bans on sales to youth may help deter use. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Combined with the ubiquity and constant connectivity of mobile devices, and with innovative approaches such as Data-Driven Learning (DDL), Natural Language Processing Technologies (NLPTs) as Open Educational Resources (OERs) could become a powerful tool for language learning as they promote individual and personalized learning. Using a questionnaire that was answered by language teachers (n = 230) in Spain and the UK, this research explores the extent to which OER NLPTs are currently known and used in adult foreign language learning. Our results suggest that teachers’ familiarity and use of OER NLPTs are very low. Although online dictionaries, collocation dictionaries and spell checkers are widely known, NLPTs appear to be generally underused in foreign language teaching. It was found that teachers prefer computer-based environments over mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets and that teachers’ qualification determines their familiarity with a wider range of OER NLPTs. This research offers insight into future applications of Language Processing Technologies as OERs in language learning. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Mobile journalism is one of the fastest areas of growth in the modern journalism industry. Yet mobile journalists find themselves in a place of tension, between print, broadcast, and digital journalism and between traditional journalism and lifestyle journalism. Using the lens of field theory, the present study conducted an online survey of mobile journalists (N = 39) from six countries representing four continents on how they conceive of their journalistic role, and how their work is perceived within the newsroom. Participants were journalists in television, print, magazine, and digital local and national newsrooms. The present study sought to understand how mobile journalists see mobile production as a part of their journalistic role, and what field theory dimensions influence mobile production in their newsrooms. While prior research has established a growing prevalence of lifestyle journalism, the present study finds that the growth of mobile journalism represents the development of lifestyle journalism norms, such as content driven by the audience, within even traditional journalism.

AB  - This paper describes three case studies, where language learners were invited to use 'LingoBee' as a means of supporting their language learning. LingoBee is a mobile app that provides user-generated language content in a cloud-based shared repository. Assuming that today’s students are mobile savvy and 'Digital Natives' able to engage in language learning autonomously using technology, initial studies were conducted with little or no intervention by the language teachers. However, the support and guidance provided within a teacher-led context can impact positively on learner engagement and use of LingoBee. The authors discuss this hypothesis using three case studies conducted in three European countries, within the EU LLP project SIMOLA, Situated Mobile Language Learning. This paper answers the research question: Does the level of the support and guidance, pedagogical approach and prior learning impact on learners’ engagement and use of LingoBee? An earlier version of this paper was presented at the IADIS Mobile Learning 2013 conference. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Mobile device (e.g., smartphone) proficiency is becoming increasingly necessary to perform important everyday tasks, and inadequate proficiency can prevent groups of individuals such as older adults from obtaining the benefits of mobile computing and smartphone utilization. To facilitate mobile device training and research on barriers to mobile device use and adoption by older adults, Roque and Boot [1] developed the Mobile Device Proficiency Questionnaire (MDPQ). The current study is the first to assess the validity of the MDPQ based on confirmatory factor analysis and objective measures of their smartphone skills. In addition, it represents the first attempt to validate the MDPQ on a sample of older smartphone users. Results suggest that modifications may be necessary for the MDPQ to serve as a valid and reliable measure of proficiency among older adult smartphone users. In this sense, four important implications and recommendations for application of the MDPQ are discussed that could promote the general goal of ensuring that individuals of all ages can benefit from the use of smartphone devices and services such as mobile apps.

AB  - Self-administered surveys can be conducted on mobile web-capable devices, yet these devices have unique features that can affect response processes. Ninety-two adults were randomly selected and provided with mobile devices to complete weekly web surveys. Experiments were designed to address three main objectives. First, the authors test fundamental findings which have been found robust across other modes, but whose impact may be diminished in mobile web surveys (due largely to the device), by manipulating question order and scale frequencies. Second, the authors test findings from experiments in computer-administered web surveys, altering the presentation of images and the number of questions per page. Third, the authors experiment with the unique display, navigation, and input methods, through the need to scroll, the vertical versus horizontal orientation of scales, and the willingness to provide open-ended responses. Although most findings from other modes are upheld, the small screen and keyboard introduce undesirable differences in responses.

AB  - Rationale: As therapeutic interventions are being developed utilising telehealth and mobile phones, it is important to understand how substance‐dependent individuals will respond to offers of online assistance. Objectives: The present paper considered the following: (1) how decision‐making style is associated with use and dependence upon commonly used stimulants and (2) how it influences behavioural responses to electronic offers of further information about these drugs. Method: An online survey examined patterns of nicotine and caffeine use, administered Severity of Dependence Scales for caffeine and nicotine and assessed decision‐making style using the Melbourne Decision Making Questionnaire and mood using the Kessler Distress Scale. Upon completing these scales, the 181 participants with a mean age of 28.14 years were offered further information online. Results: Stimulant dependence was associated with psychological distress. Caffeine dependence was linked to hypervigilance (panic). Decisional self‐esteem varied with stimulant dependence and Kessler Distress Scale score. Participants with high decisional self‐esteem declined electronic offers of further information. Conclusion: Confidence rather than defensive avoidance was a factor in reducing information‐seeking behaviours on the Internet. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Multiple computing devices continue to develop capabilities that support online gambling, resulting in the need to evaluate the extent that this trend will contribute to gambling problems. A sample of 1,141 participants completed an online survey assessing interest in and difficulties limiting use of digital services. Questionnaire items measured a range of behaviours associated with electronic service use (e.g., surfing, complaints). Results indicated that individuals utilising digital services and experiencing problems limiting their TV and Mobile phone usage were more likely to report gambling problems. These respondents were more likely to click on gambling-related links, report receiving larger amounts of spam, make more attempts to unsubscribe, and to click on links to counselling sites. Exposure and interest in electronic modes of communication can be associated with a greater risk of gambling related problems. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Despite the growing number of digital apps designed to teach coding skills to young children, we know little about their effectiveness. To formally explore this question, we conducted a naturalistic observation of a one-week program designed to teach foundational coding skills (i.e., sequencing, conditions, loops) to young children (N = 28, Mage = 5.15 years) using two tablet applications: Daisy the Dinosaur and Kodable. Pre- and post-assessments measured familiarity with technology, appeal of coding apps, knowledge of Daisy commands, ability to play Kodable, and conceptual understanding of coding. Participants improved in their knowledge of Daisy commands (i.e., move, grow, jump) and Kodable gameplay (i.e., placing arrows in the correct sequence to move a character through a maze), but did not improve in their ability to verbally explain what coding is. Appeal of the games was significantly related to children's learning of Daisy commands, but child gender was not related to either Daisy or Kodable learning outcomes. Results suggest that young children can learn foundational coding skills via apps, especially when the apps are appealing to children. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Electromyographic (EMG) signals play a key role in many clinical and biomedical applications. They can be used for identifying patients with muscular disabilities, assessing lower-back pain, kinesiology and motor control. There are three common applications of the EMG signal: (1) to determine the activation timing of the muscle; (2) to estimate the force produced by the muscle and (3) to analyze muscular fatigue through analysis of the frequency spectrum of the signal. We have developed an EMG tool that was incorporated in an existing web-based biosignal acquisition and processing framework. This tool can be used on a post-processing environment and provides not only frequency and time parameters, but also an automatic detection of starting and ending times for muscular voluntary contractions using a threshold-based algorithm with the inclusion of the Teager-Kaiser energy operator. The algorithm for the muscular voluntary contraction detection can also be reported after a real-Time acquisition, in order to discard possible outliers and simultaneously compare activation times in different muscles. This tool covers all known applications and allows a careful and detailed analysis of the EMG signal for both clinicians and researchers. The detection algorithm works without user interference and is also user-independent. It manages to detect muscular activations in an interactive process. The user simply has to select the signal's time interval as input, and the outcomes are provided afterwards.

AB  - Although Mobile Instant Messaging (MIM) is a massive communication phenomenon and its educational use can be seen as a genuine form of mobile learning, it has been studied to a limited extent to date. The present study examined the use of MIM to engage young professionals in mobile learning communities during their school-to-work transition. This transition is one of the most central but also challenging developmental phases marked by the experience of knowledge gaps and a lack of belonging. To assess knowledge and socio-professional learning effects associated with the use of MIM, this study adopted a quasi-experimental, survey-based approach with an intervention and control condition (n = 114) in the setting of an international research project. In the intervention condition, newly graduated nurses from Nigeria participated in WhatsApp groups in which moderators shared knowledge and stimulated professional discussions over a period of 6 months. Data were collected via online surveys and knowledge tests. The findings show that participants in the moderated WhatsApp groups had significantly higher knowledge and exhibited fewer feelings of professional isolation compared with the control group, which was not subject of any treatment. The effects were even more pronounced when controlling for active contributions (writing vs reading messages), which also amounted to significantly higher levels of professional identification. In addition, across intervention and control groups, the self-reported general active use of WhatsApp (outside of the intervention) was positively associated with the measures of professional social capital maintained with school connections, professional identity, (lower) professional isolation, job satisfaction, and the perceived transfer of school knowledge to work practice. Whereas knowledge and socio-professional effects can be triggered through moderated WhatsApp interventions yet the general (and thus informal) use of WhatsApp is associated with socio-professional connectedness. The findings are of particular relevance in the developing context under investigation, which is marked by a lack of alternative support structures.

AB  - Developed and implemented a new system that utilizes the P300 pattern to compose music. The P300 event-related potential is a well-known pattern in the electroencephalogram (EEG). This kind of brain signal is used for many different brain-computer interface (BCI) applications, e.g., spellers, environmental controllers, web browsers, or for painting. In recent times, BCI systems are mature enough to leave the laboratories to be used by the end-users, namely severely disabled people. Therefore, new challenges arise and the systems should be implemented and evaluated according to user-centered design (USD) guidelines. The developed Brain Composing system consists of three parts: the EEG acquisition device, the P300-based BCI, and the music composing software. 17 musical participants and one professional composer performed a copy-spelling, a copy-composing, and a free-composing task with the system. The efficiency, effectiveness, and subjective criteria were investigated in terms of satisfaction, enjoyment, frustration, and attractiveness according to the USD guidelines. Measures included visual analogue scales, the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX), and the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ). Results showed that the musical participants group achieved high average accuracies: 88.24% (copy-spelling), 88.58% (copy-composing), and 76.51% (free-composing). The professional composer also achieved high accuracies: 100% (copy-spelling), 93.62% (copy-composing), and 98.20% (free-composing). General results regarding the subjective criteria evaluation were that the participants enjoyed the usage of the Brain Composing system and were highly satisfied with the system. Showing very positive results with healthy people in this study, this was the first step towards a music composing system for severely disabled people.

AB  - Adapted to different ecological niches, moth species belonging to the Hyles genus exhibit a spectacular diversity of larval color patterns. These species diverged ∼7.5 million years ago, making this rather young genus an interesting system to study a wide range of questions including the process of speciation, ecological adaptation, and adaptive radiation. Results: Here we present a high-quality genome assembly of the bat hawkmoth Hyles vespertilio, the first reference genome of a member of the Hyles genus. We generated 51× Pacific Biosciences long reads with an average read length of 8.9 kb. Pacific Biosciences reads longer than 4 kb were assembled into contigs, resulting in a 651.4-Mb assembly consisting of 530 contigs with an N50 value of 7.5 Mb. The circular mitochondrial contig has a length of 15,303 bp. The H. vespertilio genome is very repeat-rich and exhibits a higher repeat content (50.3%) than other Bombycoidea species such as Bombyx mori (45.7%) and Manduca sexta (27.5%). We developed a comprehensive gene annotation workflow to obtain consensus gene models from different evidence including gene projections, protein homology, transcriptome data, and ab initio predictions. The resulting gene annotation is highly complete with 94.5% of BUSCO genes being completely present, which is higher than the BUSCO completeness of the B. mori (92.2%) and M. sexta (90%) annotations. Conclusions: Our gene annotation strategy has general applicability to other genomes, and the H. vespertilio genome provides a valuable molecular resource to study a range of questions in this genus, including phylogeny, incomplete lineage sorting, speciation, and hybridization. A genome browser displaying the genome, alignments, and annotations is available at https://genome-public.pks.mpg.de/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=HLhylVes1.

AB  - Novel data-mining tasks in e-science involve mining of distributed, highly heterogeneous data and knowledge sources. However, standard data mining platforms, such as Weka and Orange, involve only their own data mining algorithms in the process of knowledge discovery from local data sources. In contrast, next generation data mining technologies should enable processing of distributed data sources, the use of data mining algorithms implemented as web services, as well as the use of formal descriptions of data sources and knowledge discovery tools in the form of ontologies, enabling automated composition of complex knowledge discovery workflows for a given data mining task. This paper proposes a novel Service-oriented Knowledge Discovery framework and its implementation in a service-oriented data mining environment Orange4WS (Orange for Web Services), based on the existing Orange data mining toolbox and its visual programming environment, which enables manual composition of data mining workflows. The new service-oriented data mining environment Orange4WS includes the following new features: simple use of web services as remote components that can be included into a data mining workflow; simple incorporation of relational data mining algorithms; a knowledge discovery ontology to describe workflow components (data, knowledge and data mining services) in an abstract and machine-interpretable way, and its use by a planner that enables automated composition of data mining workflows. These new features are showcased in three real-world scenarios. © 2011 The Author. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The British Computer Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - We investigate people’s attitudes toward the possible use of negotiation support systems (NSS) in different social contexts and the consequences for their design. To explore functional requirements and social acceptance in different use contexts, we followed a three-step approach. In the first step, we conducted a number of focus groups with negotiation experts. Second, we conducted focus groups with potential users. The focus groups were a qualitative exploration of people’s ideas about NSS that led to design guidelines for mobile NSS. Third, we conducted an online survey (a) to find out in which situations people consider a mobile NSS socially acceptable, (b) to find the factors and relationships that influence this acceptance in the different situations and social contexts, and (c) to investigate the consequences of people’s attitudes toward NSS for the system’s design. The data showed that subjective norm is an important factor influencing the intention to use the system and that the acceptance of NSS depends on the use context. Therefore, we argue that NSS should be designed not only merely as tools being used in the actual negotiation but also as social devices harnessing social networks to provide support in all negotiation phases.

AB  - Cycling is becoming one of the most popular forms of recreation and transport the world over, but cyclists still have a high level of vulnerability. A bicycle helmet is an important safety device available to cyclists, but little is known regarding possible determinants of helmet use among adults. This study aims at providing information on helmet usage patterns in Italy and identifying the factors associated with bicycle helmet use. Data on 2072 bicycle riders from an Italian friends of cycling association aged 18 years or older who had ridden a bicycle in the last month were collected using an ad-hoc questionnaire via the web. The sample was equally distributed among subjects who always, most of the time, sometimes, rarely, or never use a helmet. To evaluate the association among socio-demographic and bicycle use characteristics and helmet use, a multinomial logistic regression model was performed. The results show a higher propensity to use a helmet among males, riders coming from Central and Southern Italy, people who cycles more than 60kilometres in a week, cyclists who have already had a crash, people who do not cycle daily or almost daily, riders of sport bikes. Moreover, the propensity to use a helmet increases with age. The survey provided a first step in approaching the lack of data on cycling behaviour and the wearing of a helmet in Italy.

AB  - Although text messaging while driving is illegal in Spain previous research has shown that a substantial proportion of drivers, particularly young drivers, engage in this risky behaviour. The present study set out to investigate the psychological predictors of this behaviour using the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). This study also measured the drivers' perceptions regarding the effectiveness of the ban on mobile phone use while driving, their perceived crash risk, the risk of being fined and the drivers perceived ability to compensate for the distraction caused by reading or writing text messages while driving. Data were collected using an online questionnaire from 1082 university students who were drivers and owned a mobile phone. Attitude and perceived behavioural control significantly predicted the intention to send and read text messages while driving, even after controlling for exposure and demographic variables. Furthermore, intention was found to be a significant predictor of retrospective measures of both sending and reading text messages while driving, as was perceived behavioural control for several of the outcome measures. The present findings provide support for the TPB and also demonstrate the additional contributions that the mobile phone ban and perceived ability to compensate for the distraction had in predicting intentions. In addition, perceived crash risk was positively related to the prediction of intentions to send text messages and the number of messages read in the last week. The implications of these findings are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The substantial growth in mobile handheld technologies has heralded the opportunity to provide physicians with access to information, resources, and people at the right time and place. But is this technology delivering the benefits to workflow and patient care promised by increased mobility? The authors conducted a systematic review to examine evidence regarding the impact of mobile handheld technology on hospital physicians' work practices and patient care, focusing on quantification of the espoused virtues of mobile technologies. The authors identified thirteen studies that demonstrated the ability of personal digital assistants (PDAs) to positively impact on areas of rapid response, error prevention, and data management and accessibility. The use of PDAs demonstrates the greatest benefits in contexts where time is a critical factor and a rapid response crucial. However, the extent to which these devices improved outcomes and workflow efficiencies because of their mobility was largely absent from the literature. The paucity of evidence calls for much needed future research that asks explicit questions about the impact the mobility of devices has on work practices and outcomes.

AB  - The increased acquisition of touch-screen technologies, such as tablet computers, in both homes and schools raises important questions about their role for very young children's learning and development. Their inherent touch-based interaction offers new opportunities for mark making practices, which are linked to literacy development, through the emergent process of using marks as symbolic representation. This paper reports a comparative study of touch-based interaction using a tablet computer versus traditional physical paint and paper. Children aged 2–3 years engaged in a free finger painting activity and colouring in activity in both paper and digital environments. Video data of their interactions was used to develop a coding scheme for analyzing touch-based interaction, providing insight into how the use of fingers and hands differed in each environment, the different types and qualities of touch that were engendered, and the composition of the final paintings produced. Findings show that while the tablet computer limited the number of fingers used for interaction, its material affordances supported speed and continuity, which led to more mark making, and different ‘scales’ of mark making extending the range of mark making practices. At the same time it limited the sensory experience of physical paint and resulted in more uniform final compositions. The findings are discussed in terms of shaping young children's mark making, the implications of the use of touch screen technologies in literacy development for educational practitioners and technology design, and key future research directions.

AB  - Ziel Für die diätetische Beurteilung können mobile Geräte mit einer Kamera als Alternative zu handgeschriebenen Papieraufzeichnungen verwendet werden. Die Nutritional Tracking Information Smartphone (Nutris-Phone)-Studie zielte darauf ab, die relative Validität und Machbarkeit einer fotobasierten Ernährungsaufzeichnung im Alltag zu untersuchen. Design Parallel zu der fotobasierten Technik wurde eine gewogene Aufzeichnung durchgeführt. Die Zufriedenheit der Teilnehmer wurde mittels eines Fragebogens ermittelt. Ein ausgebildeter Ernährungswissenschaftler bewertete die Portionsgrößen und der Nährstoffgehalt wurde berechnet (DGExpert). Spearman-Korrelation und Bland-Altman-Analysen wurden angewandt. Setting Gesunde, nicht schwangere Freiwillige (>= 18 Jahre) ohne Abnehmabsicht, rekrutiert an der Universität Ulm, Deutschland. Probanden Sechsundsechzig Teilnehmerinnen (36 % Männer, Medianalter 22 Mittelpunkt 0 (Interquartilbereich 20 Mittelpunkt 0-25 Mittelpunkt 0) Jahre) fotografierten mit einem handelsüblichen Mobiltelefon konsumierte Lebensmittel und Getränke. Ergebnisse Signifikante Korrelation zwischen der fotobasierten und der gewogenen Aufzeichnung wurde beobachtet: Energie (r=0 Zentralpunkt 991), Kohlenhydrate (r=0 Zentralpunkt 980), Fett (r=0 Zentralpunkt 972), Protein (r=0 Zentralpunkt 988), Ballaststoffe (r=0 Zentralpunkt 941). Bland-Altman-Analysen ergaben vergleichbare Mittelwerte und akzeptable 95 % Übereinstimmungsgrenzen (Energie: -345 Zentralpunkt 2 bis 302 Zentralpunkt 9 kJ (-82 Zentralpunkt 5 bis 72 Zentralpunkt 4 kcal); Kohlenhydrat: -15 Zentralpunkt 2 bis 13 Zentralpunkt 1 g; Fett: -6 Zentralpunkt 4 bis 6 Zentralpunkt 4 g; Protein: -5 Zentralpunkt 9 bis 5 Zentralpunkt 6 g; Ballaststoffe: -2 Zentralpunkt 7 bis 2 Zentralpunkt 5 g). Mit zunehmender Aufnahmemenge lag jedoch eine Unterschätzung durch die digitale Methode vor (mit Ausnahme von Fett, alle P<0 Zentralpunkt 01). Über 80 % der Teilnehmer waren mit der fotobasierten Aufzeichnung zufrieden. Bei fast 90 % war die technische Umsetzung ohne größere Probleme. Schlussfolgerungen Im Vergleich zu einer gewogenen Aufzeichnung scheint die fotobasierte Ernährungsaufzeichnung valide, durchführbar und benutzerfreundlich zu sein, um die Energie-, Makronährstoff- und Ballaststoffzufuhr abzuschätzen, wobei jedoch eine systematische Verzerrung mit zunehmender Zufuhrmenge zu berücksichtigen ist.

AB  - In this article I address some images, categories and open-ended trajectories of the laptop in music production. The aim is to explore the laptop's increasing presence in the sites of music, from cyberspace to live venues, as well as the relationship between music and mobile computerized space. Implicit in the article is the claim that the laptop is a neglected device, but that close attention to its position in cultural networks and everyday settings is one way of examining some possible ways into the complex entanglements and layerings of mobile space. The first part of the article explores the laptop as the archetypal nomadic machine of the digital age, inserted into mobile networks, hubs and flows. The laptop mediates mobility and by doing so not only serves macro-processes of social and economic change, but also opens up creative possibilities for the musician beyond the studio and the home. The second part of the article examines the role of software in activating the laptop's capabilities. The growth of music software and Virtual Studio Technology in the early 2000s, it will be argued, represents a major transformation in music production. A case study is made of a single application, Ableton Live, to show that new forms of music software encourage norms of creativity and play that take it beyond emulations of hardware studios. A residual distrust of the laptop's automative capabilities, however, reprises an anxiety in the history of popular music around questions of creativity and musicianship. The final part explores this anxiety and argues that the laptop is a place-holder for conflicting meanings about what belongs in music: productivity and creation, reality and virtuality, play and work, the cybernetic and the organic. It thereby reveals socio-technical imbroglios in action, where digitized music and software code meet the material properties of technologies and the practices of users in complex, networked societies.

AB  - Based on a study of iPod use amongst 155 undergraduate students, the article argues that an emphasis on the mediated constitution of what Bull (2007) calls "auditory bubbles" raises limited questions around the situated and varied practices of iPod users. The article instead suggests that we need to develop more sophisticated understandings of how mobile digital devices are used and appropriated in context, not just by letting users tell their own stories but by listening carefully to how these stories point to anomalies, variations and discordances in their use and non-use.

AB  - The present study aims to deepen the relationship between people's loneliness and relational motivations toward people-nearby applications (PNAs) use, within the uses and gratification framework. Indeed, due to the spread of indifference and mistrust toward other citizens, local communities and the relationships within them can leave some individuals' social needs unsatisfied. An online questionnaire, including the Social and Emotional Loneliness Scale for Adults-short version and the Cyber Relationships Motives Scale, was administered to 647 PNAs users (age: M = 26.76; standard deviation = 8.77); hierarchical regressions were performed. Individuals' loneliness associated significantly with the search for love and the desire to meet new people when perceiving offline constraints, but not with the simple desire to meet new people. These results support the idea that PNAs could represent a mean to integrate the aggregation functions of local communities, allowing to find new people to meet nearby regardless of the constraints actually perceived. Being social relationships critical for individuals' well-being, understanding the unsatisfied individual needs underlying PNAs social uses and how these apps could be used within local communities could help in integrating people within their local communities and neighbourhoods again, fostering their well-being too.

AB  - This chapter describes case studies conducted in five European countries, where language learners were invited to use 'LingoBee,' a mobile app, as a means of supporting their language learning. Assuming that today’s language learners are mobile savvy and 'Digital Natives' and that they should be able to engage in language learning autonomously using technology, initial studies were conducted with little or no intervention by the language teachers. However, the support and guidance provided within a teacher-led context can impact positively on learner engagement. The case studies confirm this hypothesis. This chapter addresses the research question: Does the level of the support and guidance and pedagogical approach impact on learners’ engagement and the synergy between formal and informal learning? Based on the experiences from the five case studies, recommendations are provided for teachers and designers of educational technologies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The Internet has always been understood through spatial terminology—cyberspace, web addresses, sites, domains—but this article argues for moving beyond the metaphors to recognize the Internet as an embodied and socially-produced digital space. Building from a Lefebvrian framework of perceived, conceived, and lived spaces, the article proposes a new model for examining Internet social space, featuring three co-productive spaces: a space of affordance, a space of programming, and a space of virtuality. While our interaction with Internet social space is enabled through affordances, these actions are constrained by the limitations of the Internet's underlying programming. It is possible to subvert this power dynamic through tactical action when we realize that—unlike the spaces of affordance and programming—the space of virtuality is not tethered to any specific program or paradigm, but rather exists across platforms.

AB  - In recent years, the new media have become so attractive that they are used for meetings, entertainment, and work. People more and more often use Facebook or phones instead of doing their work or family duties. The main aim of the present study was to test the mediating role of future anxiety in the relationship between procrastination and problematic new media use. The participants were students (N = 478), aged 18 to 27 (M = 19.93, SD = 1.77); 64% of the sample were women. The General Procrastination Scale, the Decisional Procrastination Scale, the Facebook Intrusion Questionnaire, the Adapted Mobile Phone Use Habits, and the Future Anxiety Scale-Short Form were used. The study showed that those students who procrastinated often reported a high tendency to engage in problematic new media use and a high level of future anxiety. The findings of the study have important implications for research on problematic Facebook and mobile phone use. They may be applicable in the work of psychologists, psychiatrists, and therapists, both in prevention and in developing online addiction therapies.

AB  - Advances in information and communication technologies have made it increasingly easy for individuals to remain connected to their organizations. Part of this change may be due to the advent of mobile communication technologies such as smart phones (e.g., BlackBerry, iPhone, Palm Treo) that have revolutionized when and where individuals are able to perform their work. Past research concerning the effects of mobile technology in the workplace has been both optimistic and pessimistic, suggesting that mobile technology results in increased autonomy, work functioning, and work-schedule flexibility, while at the same time resulting in negative consequences such as increased work-life conflict, role overload, and an invasion of workers' sense of personal mastery. The current study presents a model examining the effects of mobile connectivity on work-life outcomes during non-working hours. The present study tests a series of direct, mediating, and moderating models that influence the relationship between mobile connectivity and stress, psychological well-being, job satisfaction, and life satisfaction. Specifically, work-life conflict was hypothesized to mediate the relationship between mobile connectivity and each of the work-life outcome variables, while boundary management strategy, psychological detachment from work, job involvement, and job control were included as moderating variables that influence the strength and direction of the relationship between mobile connectivity and each of the work-life outcomes. Participants in the study included 311 individuals collected through a web-based survey among users of mobile technologies. Results indicate that mobile connectivity was positively related to stress and work-life conflict, while negatively related to psychological well-being. Furthermore, results from the mediated analyses suggest that work-life conflict acted as a significant mediator between mobile connectivity and stress, psychological well-being, and job satisfaction. The present study's findings suggest that mobile connectivity is impacting work-life outcomes in more negative than positive ways. Because mobile technologies are changing the ways in which we stay connected to work while during non-working hours, it is important to understand how mobile technology affect outcomes related to an employee's work and non-work lives. Implications for both employees and employers are discussed with particular emphasis on the changing nature of technology.

AB  - Urban regions are complicated functional systems that are closely associated with and reshaped by human activities. The propagation of online geographic information-sharing platforms and mobile devices equipped with the Global Positioning System (GPS) greatly proliferates proximate sensing images taken near or on the ground at a close distance to urban targets. Studies leveraging proximate sensing images have demonstrated great potential to address the need for local data in the urban land-use analysis. This paper reviews and summarizes the state-of-the-art methods and publicly available data sets from proximate sensing to support land-use analysis. We identify several research problems in the perspective of examples to support the training of models and means of integrating diverse data sets. Our discussions highlight the challenges, strategies, and opportunities faced by the existing methods using proximate sensing images in urban land-use studies.

AB  - This paper seeks to provide new empirical evidence that demonstrates the importance of digital technologies in promoting economic growth, drawing on the literature on advances in growth and leveraging a broader and more robust country-level panel dataset. In particular, this paper estimates the long-run economic impact of digital technologies using mobile phone penetration and internet usage as broad indicators. The empirical results suggest that, between 2004 and 2014, the diffusion of digital technologies significantly improved economic output in Australia and abroad, contributing to steady-state gross domestic product per capita growth of approximately 5.8 per cent on average. These findings could serve as the starting-point for predictions about the likely impact of future technologies, providing a better understanding for policy-makers in prioritising initiatives that will continue to lift living standards in the coming years.

AB  - Informed by the social orientation of loyalty, the study extends the current body of knowledge by integrating multiple relationship layers (i.e., personal loyalty, relationship with online consumption communities and local network effects) as antecedents of various states of firm‐customer interactions including habitual loyalty, fanaticism, and retaliation. Data collection was carried out in the mobile telecommunications market using a paper‐based survey. A total of 600 completed survey responses were collected. The respondents were 18 or older and had been mobile service users for at least 1 year. Overall, it was found that personal loyalty, relationship with online consumption communities and local network effects were significant antecedents of fanaticism. Personal loyalty and local network effects can reinforce habitual loyalty whereas the relationship with online consumption communities can increase retaliation. The role of relationship with online consumption communities becomes more significant as customers perceive a higher level of indifference among service providers. Further, local network effects were significantly and negatively related to retaliation. The findings of this study provide important theoretical and practical implications for academics and practitioners alike, especially in the contractual, network industries.

AB  - This paper explores computer failure as a social event by examining recorded interactions between computer users and help-desk consultants (technicians). It was found, first, that the nature of a failure was negotiated between participants rather than being simply technically evident. Failure was defined from users' perspectives, in relation to what they were trying to achieve, rather than according to technical parameters. Secondly, negotiations of failure had social consequences for both users and help-desk consultants. Both avoided being seen as incompetent and actively defended their social standing. Thirdly, such social issues sometimes took precedence over technical and practical ones. The implications for HCI theorists and practitioners are twofold: firstly, failure should be accepted as a regular part of computer use in which human-computer interaction continues even though the interface may be non-functional. Secondly, the management of failure could be better addressed if technicians were trained in social as well as technical intervention skills. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Computer users have access to computer security information from many different sources, but few people receive explicit computer security training. Despite this lack of formal education, users regularly make many important security decisions, such as "Should I click on this potentially shady link?" or "Should I enter my password into this form?" For these decisions, much knowledge comes from incidental and informal learning. To better understand differences in the securityrelated information available to users for such learning, we compared three informal sources of computer security information: news articles, web pages containing computer security advice, and stories about the experiences of friends and family. Using a Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model, we found that security information from peers usually focuses on who conducts attacks, information containing expertise focuses instead on how attacks are conducted, and information from the news focuses on the consequences of attacks. These differences may prevent users from understanding the persistence and frequency of seemingly mundane threats (viruses, phishing), or from associating protective measures with the generalized threats the users are concerned about (hackers). Our findings highlight the potential for sources of informal security education to create patterns in user knowledge that affect their ability to make good security decisions.

AB  - Due to highly innovative technologies such as the smart phone, cyberbullying and on-line aggression have increasingly affected individuals across the world. In this study, a broad symbolic interactionist approach is used to study both cyberbullying and on-line aggression. Cyberbullying is defined as repeated unwanted, hurtful, harassing, and/or threatening interaction through electronic communication media. On-line aggression is defined as hurtful, harassing, and/or threatening behavior that is not repeated. Undergraduate students at a Midwestern university (N = 221) were surveyed to determine the extent and nature of their cyberbullying and on-line aggression experiences. By using open ended questions to inquire about respondents' personal experiences with cyberbullying and on-line aggression, we identified three motivations for these acts, which included cyber sanctioning, power struggles, and entertainment. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the role of English as Foreign Language (EFL) learners’ metacognitive listening strategies awareness and podcast-use readiness in using podcasting technology for learning English as a foreign language. One hundred and forty-one EFL students completed Metacognitive Awareness Listening Questionnaire (MALQ) that assessed their awareness and perceived use of listening strategies in five components including planning-evaluation, directed attention, person knowledge, mental translation, and problem solving. They also completed a questionnaire that assessed their readiness to use podcasting in terms of familiarity, attitude, and experience. Information on participants’ frequency of podcast use for learning English, frequency of the internet use, and digital device ownership was also obtained. The result of the analysis revealed that podcasting use was significantly related to metacognitive listening strategies awareness in general and its entire components except mental translation strategies while the strongest correlation was found with problem solving strategies (r = .49, p < 0.01). Podcasting use was also found to be significantly related to perceived podcast-use readiness and internet use hours. Further, multiple regressions showed that perceived podcast-use readiness, problem solving, and person knowledge -in order of power prediction- were good predictors of podcasting use for learning English as a foreign language.

AB  - Virtualization as one of the leading technologies has assisted datacenters to cloudify their products and provide versatile platforms and variety of Internet services. This technology also has facilitated agile deployment of complex Internet services such as Cloud-based multi-tier applications. However implementing multi-tier applications assists providers to set up flexible and scalable services, deploying such applications in virtualized environments faces challenges, which harden collocation of disparate multi-tier applications in a shared environment. In this article, we propose a placement strategy to consolidate multi-tier applications' tiers in a virtualized datacenter regarding workload demands of individual tiers, utilization of physical hosts' resources and operational status of virtual machines. The placement strategy identifies over-utilized hosts based on the birth- death stochastic process and ranks tiers based on Data Envelopment Analysis-Analytic Hierarchy Process modeling to be placed on target hosts. A prioritized tier will be placed on an appropriate host though least operational interference with hosted tiers incurred. The efficiency of the proposed model is evaluated using a series of in-depth experiments. We introduce results derived from quantitative and qualitative analyses that are useful for multi-tier applications placement in virtualized datacenters. Simulation results reveal that the proposed solution excels in terms of both load distribution and energy consumption in the datacenter, while the number of unnecessary migrations and consecutive Service Level Agreement violations is considerably reduced.

The article by by Smith, Tremont, and Ott, comes at a critical time in our planning for the future of Alzheimer’s diagnosis and care; but, this review also piques a number of moral and ethical questions that merit discussion and thoughtful debate. How would the person be informed about the results of the screening? Would a 'live' person deliver the results by phone, or would it be a digital computer voice indicating that the person should seek further evaluation? I would hope the results are given in a manner that does not frighten the person unduly and explains what the screen really means and how they can get more help.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of the study was to examine associations of gender role beliefs with marital safety as well as social and digital connectivity among married adolescent girls in India. Methods: We analyzed cross-sectional survey data from married adolescent girls from rural Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, India in 2015–2016 (N = 4,893). Gender role belief items assessed participants' beliefs regarding appropriateness of female marital choice and economic decision-making, male childcare responsibility, and marital violence. The outcomes were time with friends (social connection), freedom of movement, mobile phone ownership and internet access (digital connection), and safety from marital violence (marital safety). Adjusted regression models examined associations between gender role beliefs and outcomes, caste/religion beliefs related to segregation, and demographics. Results: Beliefs supportive of female marital choice (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00–1.88, p = .048) and female economic decision-making (AOR 1.43, 95% CI 1.03–1.99, p = .03) were associated with social connection. Beliefs supportive of female marital choice (AOR 1.88, 95% CI 1.31–2.71, p = .001), female economic decision-making (AOR 1.67, 95% CI 1.03–2.72, p = .04), and male childcare responsibilities (AOR 1.42, 95% CI 1.05–1.94, p = .03) were associated with freedom of movement. Belief supporting female marital choice was associated with mobile phone ownership (AOR 1.23, 95% CI 1.01–1.50, p = .04), and belief supporting male childcare responsibility was associated with internet access (AOR 1.76, 95% CI 1.11–2.77, p = .02). Beliefs supportive of female marital choice (AOR .73, 95% CI .59–.89, p = .003), male childcare responsibility (AOR 1.26, 95% CI 1.03–1.54, p = .02), and unacceptability of marital violence (AOR 1.72, 95% CI 1.38–2.15, p < .001) were associated with safety from marital violence. Conclusions: Progressive gender role beliefs regarding female choice, control, and safety in marriage are associated with greater connectivity and safety for married adolescent girls in India. Future studies that can longitudinally assess these associations are warranted. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objectives: 1) To enhance the content of an ontology for designing virtual environments (VEs) for upper limb motor rehabilitation of stroke patients according to the suggestions and comments of rehabilitation specialists and software developers, 2) to characterize the perceived importance level of the ontology, 3) to determine the perceived usefulness of the ontology, and 4) to identify the safety characteristics of the ontology for VEs design according to the rehabilitation specialists.
Methods: Using two semi-structured Web questionnaires, we asked six rehabilitation specialists and six software developers to provide us with their perception regarding the level of importance and the usability of the ontology. From their responses we have identified themes related to perceived and required safety characteristics of the ontology.
Results: Significant differences in the importance level were obtained for the Stroke Disability, VE Configuration, Outcome Measures, and Safety Calibration classes, which were perceived as highly important by rehabilitation specialists. Regarding usability, the ontology was perceived by both groups with high usefulness, ease of use, learnability and intention of use. Concerning the thematic analysis of recommendations, eight topics for safety characteristics of the ontology were identified: adjustment of therapy strategies; selection and delimitation of movements; selection and proper calibration of the interaction device; proper selection of measuring instruments; gradual modification of the difficulty of the exercise; adaptability and variability of therapy exercises; feedback according to the capabilities of the patient; and real-time support for exercise training.
Conclusions: The rehabilitation specialists and software developers confirmed the importance of the information contained in the ontology regarding motor rehabilitation of the upper limb. Their recommendations highlight the safety features and the advantages of the ontology as a guide for the effective design of VEs.

AB  - An important part of current research regarding online risks is aimed at analysing cyber aggression according to its frequency and type. By contrast, there is less scientific knowledge available on risk perception, the analysis of its components, and the measurement and impact on the behaviour of minors on the Internet. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to establish a classification of minors based on their perception of risk, digital consumption habits, family and/or educational protection factors, and the flow of communication. A structured questionnaire was used from a sample of 865 minors aged 10 to 17 from the Autonomous Region of Madrid. Data were processed using SPSS 15.0 and SPAD 5.0. After a factor and classification analysis was conducted, seven different groups were obtained. The predominant profile, in 42% of the cases, is that of a 'prudent person', characterized by a high perception of risk, not spending an excessive amount of time on the Internet, avoiding unsafe behaviour, talking with parents about online difficulties, receiving advice, and having clear rules on Internet use. The perception of risk is shown as a relevant construct in relation to other indicators such as child-rearing techniques used by parents, the time children spend on Internet, dependency on the device, and the type of digital behavior involved.

AB  - Smartphone use influences teenagers' behaviors and lifestyles, not always in a positive way. Abuse and dependence on the use of this device is what has led to the study of nomophobia. The objective of this research is to measure the level of nomophobia in adolescents, and to study their digital consumption habits. The study seeks to analyze the relationships between risk of nomophobia, digital behavior, age and smartphone use. A structured questionnaire has been applied to a sample of 850 students aged 12 to 16. The data has been analyzed with SPSS and SPAD. Multivariate statistical characterization, one of the most recent data mining techniques, has been used to study differences in teenagers' behaviors according to their risk of nomophobia, and to find related explanatory variables. Teenagers' nomophobia risk ranges from mild to moderate, showing a relation with age, academic performance and intensity of use of mobile social networking apps. The risk of nomophobia responds to differences in students' digital, social, relational and educational behaviors, and exhibits differences according to academic performance, age, gender, motivation and self-perception.

AB  - Growth of digital, social, and mobile media has enabled engagement with multiple media activities during news consumption in a more efficient and synchronous fashion than before. This study investigates whether media multitasking activities while consuming political news affects individuals' levels of subjective and factual political knowledge. Results from a Web survey of online panel members show that on the whole, pairwise and bundled forms of media multitasking are negatively related to factual political knowledge. Also, those who engage in media multitasking are more likely to report that they are politically knowledgeable but they do not know about politics as much as they think they do. Implications are discussed for media multitasking and an informed citizenry. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Digital technologies have led to the emergence of new forms of flexible work, such as crowdwork or information and communication technology-enabled mobile work, over the past decade. This is considered as a positive development for its high flexibility in hours and place of work, and also for providing employment opportunities to workers in developing countries, individuals with disabilities or those with care responsibilities. This article examines the on-going trend in outsourcing low-skilled work to the crowd through online platforms, and how platform design features and algorithmic management are used by digital labour platforms to assign, monitor and evaluate work. The paper argues that these distinctive features of digital platforms have an impact on working conditions in terms of access to tasks, remuneration and working time flexibility. The paper draws on a global survey of 675 workers on five globally operating platforms in 27 developing countries. Its findings highlight the need for transparency in platform architecture, design and algorithms to ensure that workers are protected from the vulnerabilities they face with digital work.

AB  - This study reports a content analysis of 35 World Wide Web sites that included in their mission the goal of engaging girls with information and communication technology (ICT). It finds that sites emphasize cultural and economic uses of ICT, doing little to foster civic applications that could empower girls as citizens of the information age. The study also finds that sites foster a narrow range of ICT proficiencies, focusing mostly on areas such as communication, in which girls have already achieved parity with boys. An examination of the role models portrayed in ICT occupations indicates that the sites show females mainly in elite technology jobs, reversing stereotypical mass media depictions of females in low-status roles in relation to ICT. Employing an original index of ICT knowledge and skills, the study finds that the sites that scored highest both on fostering comprehensive knowledge and skills as well as featuring civic content were general interest Web communities. Ownership (for-profit or not-for-profit) of sites was less important than editorial control: Sites that offered girls a place to contribute their own content were more likely to offer civic material and a broader range of ICT knowledge and skills. We conclude with recommendations for Web site designers to rethink their design strategies and their rationales for closing the gender gap in computing. © 2006 International Communication Association.

AB  - Recently a number of studies appeared that operationalised coolness and explored its relation to digital products. Literature suggests that perceived coolness is another factor of user experience, and this adds to an existing explosion of dimensions related to aesthetics, hedonic quality, pragmatic quality, attractiveness, etc. A critical challenge highlighted in prior research is to study the relationships among those factors and so far, no studies have empirically examined the relationship between coolness and other established user experience factors. In this paper, we address this challenge by presenting two studies one that focuses on factors from two cool questionnaires, and one that compares them against existing User eXperience (UX) factors. Our findings show that factors from the two cool questionnaires converge and they also converge to existing, established UX factors. Thus, 11 distinct cool and UX factors converge into 5 for the case of mobile devices. Our findings are important for researchers, as we demonstrate through a validated model that coolness is part of UX research, as well as for practitioners, by developing a questionnaire that can reliably measure both perceived inner and outer coolness as well as the overall coolness judgement based on 5 factors and 21 items.

AB  - Successful inclusion is a subject that addresses the question of how well a society can prevent discrimination and ensure access to information, products, services, and spaces for all. Disability may not necessarily lead to exclusion, unless society fails to respond to the needs of people regardless of their impairment. Digital tools combined with ethnographic research may help researchers explore users’ needs, perceptions, behaviors, and attitudes and can aid in understanding the interactions between the human, the space, and the digital within the urban realm. This paper thus outlines a diversity of digital tools in the context of the disability-inclusive city. Through ethnographic encounters with Joe, Ann, and Vanessa, we then explore how these tools can be applied to practice. Centering on Joe, we attempt to exemplify some of the key issues that need to be addressed when looking into the terrain of disability, the city, and digital tools.Points of interestThis paper explores how mobile phones and mobile applications can support people with disabilities in accessing the city and its services.The research also explores how modern technology, such as mobile applications can support city officials in understanding better what makes cities more disability friendly.With the help of Joe, Vanessa and Ann from Maribor, Slovenia, the authors have tried out a selected number of mobile applications and observed how these can help people with disabilities use the city and its services.The research with Joe, Vanessa and Ann showed that mobile phones and mobile applications can be useful for moving around the city, but people with disabilities may still face difficulties using mobile phones while moving.The research also showed that technology can make cities more disability friendly, but it cannot remove all the barriers that people with disabilities face in their everyday lives.

AB  - This paper examines channel choice and the digital divide in Egyptian electronic government or e-government. Citizens have access to a variety of service delivery channels when they initiate contact with their government, ranging from e-government to more traditional channels such as the phone and in-person visits to a government office. This paper examines the extent of use of both contact channels for citizens and the impact of the digital divide on channel use. A public opinion survey of Egyptian citizens was analyzed, and the results showed that there was a digital divide in the use of e-government by citizens. The digital divide also extended to other contact channels such as the phone and when citizens used multiple contact channels for public service delivery. The results of this study imply that for the development of e-government, especially in the context of a developing country such as Egypt, policy-makers need to understand that e-government is one of many channels that citizens can use when they initiate contact with their government. The results of this study should encourage policy-makers to recognize the importance of public service delivery in a multichannel environment.

AB  - This study examines channel choice and public service delivery in Canada, comparing e-government to traditional service delivery channels such as the phone or visiting a government office. Factors studied include the digital divide, the nature of the citizen interaction with government, public service values, and satisfaction with services received by citizens. These factors are used to determine whether they impacted choice of channel and satisfaction with that channel. This study, through logistic regression of a public opinion survey of Canadian residents, found indications suggesting a digital divide in accessing e-government; found that government websites were most commonly used for information purposes, while the phone was most commonly used to solve problems. In regards to citizens' satisfaction, the apparent digital divide was bridged when females and older Canadians were more satisfied with their contact with a government website. In addition, a positive experience with service delivery and positive public service values lead to greater website satisfaction. The results of this study imply that the phone is a more effective service channel for solving problems, and the website is more effective for getting information. Therefore, governments need to provide multiple contact channels for citizens, depending upon their task at hand, while ensuring consistency of information and service response across channels. Creating a positive experience for citizens when they received a service translates into a more satisfied experience with e-government. [Copyright Elsevier Inc.]

AB  - Given the ever-rising frequency of malware attacks and other problems leading people to lose their files, backups are an important proactive protective behavior in which users can engage. Backing up files can prevent emotional and financial losses and improve overall user experience. Yet, we find that less than half of young adults perform mobile or computer backups regularly. To understand why, we model the factors that drive mobile and computer backup behavior, and changes in that behavior over time, using data from a panel survey of 384 diverse young adults. We develop a set of models that explain 37% and 38% of the variance in reported mobile and computer backup behaviors, respectively. These models show consistent relationships between Internet skills and backup frequency on both mobile and computer devices. We find that this relationship holds longitudinally: increases in Internet skills lead to increased frequency of computer backups. This article provides a foundation for understanding what drives young adults' backup behavior. It concludes with recommendations for motivating people to back up, and for future work, modeling similar user behaviors.

AB  - In this article, a dance metaphor is developed to deepen our understanding of the material, sensual, processual, and experiential potential of digital data relations. Premised upon Blumer’s notion of a sensitising concept, ballroom dance theory is applied to everyday use of the Apple Watch so as to prompt investigation of subtle interactional features of device use. The aim is to engender an inclusive umbrella concept while simultaneously stimulating questions of analysis of and access to small-scale and intimate moments of embodied behaviours in future interactional analysis. In so doing, the article contributes to the sociology of data relationality in everyday life, as well as constituent approaches such as science and technology studies and the interactional study of bodies and machines.

AB  - Despite decades of research demonstrating the efficacy of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), many clinicians have not adopted it into their practice. In an effort to increase the number of trained clinicians, the International OCD Foundation (IOCDF) developed a nationwide intensive training program, the Behavior Therapy Training Institute (BTTI). We report the first data on the BTTI. We emailed a 30-item online survey to all clinicians (N = 350) who attended one of twelve BTTI workshops between 2008 and 2011. One hundred and sixty one individuals (53%) responded. Participants reported more than moderate use of all BTTI skills. Expert phone consultation and peer consultation after the training were associated with greater skills use. The most commonly reported barrier to skill use was difficulty integrating the techniques into their practice because of time or an inability to leave the office. The majority of participants also reported an increase in OCD-related referrals after the BTTI. Limitations of this work, suggestions for improvement, and the implications of our findings for broader dissemination efforts are discussed.

AB  - Can digital devices enhance participation? Can the electronic ballot help trade unions in involving different categories of members in their decision-making processes and extend their representativeness? Trade union crisis is largely a legitimacy problem, as unions are representing mostly older and permanent workers. Simultaneously, the enthusiasm towards the internet as a mean to union revitalization seems to have waned somewhat. It was against this backdrop that we decided to conduct a survey of schoolteachers in Portugal and focus on the potential impact of a digital device to engage workers in union life. The survey sought to examines how the electronic ballot could be used as a tool to help decision-making, being aware of the different interests in play, and contributing to the increase of participation within trade unions. Our findings show negligible differences between teachers according to contractual status although non-unionized and precarious workers prove to be less receptive to the use of the electronic ballot.

AB  - This research explores the design, implementation, and evaluation of a prototype augmented reality application that assists operators in performing procedural tasks in control room settings. Our prototype uses a tablet display to supplement an operator’s natural view of existing control panel elements with sequences of interactive visual and attention guiding cues. An experiment, conducted using a nuclear power plant simulator, examined university students completing both standard and emergency operating procedures. The augmented reality condition was compared against two other conditions – a paper-based procedure condition using paper manuals and a computer-based procedure condition using digital procedures presented on a desktop display. The results demonstrated that the augmented reality -based procedure system had benefits in terms of reduced mental workload in comparison to the other two conditions. Regarding task completion time, accuracy, and situation awareness, the augmented reality condition had no significant difference when compared against the computer-based procedure condition but performed better than the paper-based procedure condition. It was also found that the augmented reality condition resulted in fewer intra-team inquiry communication exchanges in comparison to both paper-based and computer-based conditions. The augmented reality condition, however, yielded poorer memory retention score when assessed against the other two conditions. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study investigates the popularity of mobile messaging as a social medium. Using data from an Internet questionnaire (N = 635) on the use of the short message service (SMS) for mobile phone text messaging ('texting'), we examine two components of an affordance pathways hypothesis of SMS uptake: (1) mobile phone users must first discover and make use of hidden social affordances of texting in order to obtain significant interpersonal benefit from the medium, and (2) key social and psychological variables differentially predispose users to capitalise on these affordances. We developed and validated latent factor measures of texting affordances and relationship outcomes, examined the differential effects of a range of predictor variables on these measures, and tested a model in which the expressive and conversational use of texting mediates the effects of social anxiety, loneliness, age, and relationship status on relationship outcomes. This model proved a significant fit to the data, and was superior to alternative models which systematically varied the causal priority of SMS affordances and relationship outcomes. The results suggest that young, single, and socially anxious mobile phone users are predisposed to recognise and take advantage of the social functionality of SMS to enrich their personal relationships.

AB  - Computer technologies have been introduced into schools since about 1960, with large scale deployment starting in the 1980s once personal computers became widely available and affordable. A second wave of deployment saw the networking of computers, first in the form of classroom based local-area network (LAN), and more recently the connection to the Internet. More recent trends include such developments as the introduction of interactive whiteboards into classrooms, and the establishment of 1:1 computing (one digital device per student) in some systems. However, the major meta-analyses available at this time do not address these more recent developments—one might also add the increasing interest in mobile and cloud computing amongst them—but focus on the classic question: Do students in classes where computers are used profit from this compared to students in classes where no computers are used?

AB  - There are currently three generations of individuals that make up the genetic counselor workforce: Baby‐Boomers, Generation X, and Millennials. These generations are presumed to be shaped by the historical, cultural, and social events that occurred during critical developmental periods. Understanding the underlying perceptions and viewpoints of genetic counselors regarding the multigenerational workforce may facilitate successful working relationships as well as recognition of the perceived unique characteristics that each generation offers. An online survey was distributed to practicing genetics counselors (GC) and genetic counseling students through the National Society of Genetic Counselors and the American Board of Genetic Counseling to elicit opinions about the perceived characteristics or skills of genetic counselors in each generation. Respondents (n = 407, estimated 10% response) preferentially assigned certain traits or skills to specific generations including their own. Findings suggest GC Baby Boomers were least likely to be described as 'comfortable with phone or skype counseling' (p < 0.0001), Millennial GC, were least often assigned the term 'Strong respect for authority' (p < 0.0005) and Generation X GC were most likely to be described as 'Does not ask for feedback' (p < 0.05). These research findings demonstrate that GC perceive that their colleagues from every generation have unique attributes to bring to the profession and these attributes match those typically described in the U.S. literature about non‐GC cohorts.

Tablets were tested as potential substitutes for digital whiteboards, while smartphones were tested as potential survey media in the classroom using a question and answer method. Two teaching strategies were evaluated and compared: (1) traditional, which includes the use of the blackboard together with PowerPoint presentations and (2) interactive, where lessons are taught with the aid of a tablet, using interactive activities and digital materials. Measures of performance outcomes achieved with these strategies were made using the question and answer method at two points, during the classes and during the end-of-term examination. Three different question and answer methodologies were studied and compared, ranging from the very traditional method where students raise their hand to answer a question to the most modern where students use their smartphones to answer. The findings demonstrated higher outcomes with interactive lessons than with traditional learning (PowerPoint included). Tablets proved to be an effective and cheaper substitute for interactive whiteboards during lessons. The results suggested that the use of interactive procedures increased student participation. Furthermore, the students were very receptive to the use of smartphones as survey media. The use of smartphones as clickers is an interesting and instant way for both teachers and students to check students’ learning and perceived engagement. Considering that students are advanced users of smartphones and/or tablets, the use of these may be considered as more convenient than clickers. In addition, it is economically more acceptable than some other audience response systems. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - More and more respondents are answering web surveys using mobile devices. Mobile respondents tend to provide shorter responses to open questions than PC respondents. Using voice recording to answer open-ended questions could increase data quality and help engage groups usually underrepresented in web surveys. Revilla, Couper, Bosch, and Asensio showed that in particular the use of voice recording still presents many challenges, even if it could be a promising tool. This article reports results from a follow-up experiment in which the main goals were to (1) test whether different instructions on how to use the voice recording tool reduce technical and understanding problems, and thereby reduce item nonresponse while preserving data quality and the evaluation of the tool; (2) test whether nonresponse due to context can be reduced by using a filter question, and how this affects data quality and the tool evaluation; and (3) understand which factors affect nonresponse to open-ended questions using voice recording, and if these factors also affect data quality and the evaluation of the tool. The experiment was implemented within a smartphone web survey in Spain focused on Android devices. The results suggest that different instructions did not affect nonresponse to the open questions and had little effect on data quality for those who did answer. Introducing a filter to ensure that people were in a setting that permits voice recording seems useful. Despite efforts to reduce problems, a substantial proportion of respondents are still unwilling or unable to answer open questions using voice recording.

AB  - Much research has been done comparing grids and item-by-item formats. However, the results are mixed, and more research is needed especially when a significant proportion of respondents answer using smartphones. In this study, we implemented an experiment with seven groups (n = 1,476), varying the device used (PC or smartphone), the presentation of the questions (grids, item-by-item vertical, item-by-item horizontal), and, in the case of smartphones only, the visibility of the ?next? button (always visible or only visible at the end of the page, after scrolling down). The survey was conducted by the Netquest online fieldwork company in Spain in 2016. We examined several outcomes for three sets of questions, which are related to respondent behavior (completion time, lost focus, answer changes, and screen orientation) and data quality (item missing data, nonsubstantive responses, instructional manipulation check failure, and nondifferentiation). The most striking difference found is for the placement of the next button in the smartphone item-by-item conditions: When the button is always visible, item missing data are substantially higher.

AB  - We implemented an experiment within a smartphone web survey to explore the feasibility of using voice input (VI) options. Based on device used, participants were randomly assigned to a treatment or control group. Respondents in the iPhone operating system (iOS) treatment group were asked to use the dictation button, in which the voice was translated automatically into text by the device. Respondents with Android devices were asked to use a VI button which recorded the voice and transmitted the audio file. Both control groups were asked to answer open-ended questions using standard text entry. We found that the use of VI still presents a number of challenges for respondents. Voice recording (Android) led to substantially higher nonresponse, whereas dictation (iOS) led to slightly higher nonresponse, relative to text input. However, completion time was significantly reduced using VI. Among those who provided an answer, when dictation was used, we found fewer valid answers and less information provided, whereas for voice recording, longer and more elaborated answers were obtained. Voice recording (Android) led to significantly lower survey evaluations, but not dictation (iOS).

AB  - The development of web surveys has been accompanied by the emergence of new scales, taking advantages of the visual and interactive features provided by the Internet like drop-down menus, sliders, drag-and-drop, or order-by-click scales. This article focuses on the order-by-click scales, studying the comparability of the data obtained for this scale when answered through PCs versus smartphones. I used data from an experiment where panelists from the Netquest opt-in panel in Spain were randomly assigned to a PC, smartphone optimized, or smartphone not-optimized version of the same questionnaire in two waves. I found significant differences due to the device and optimization at least for some indicators and questions.

AB  - The increasing use of mobile devices in the frame of online surveys has been accompanied by the development of research apps. These research apps have the potential to facilitate the process for respondents (e.g. being able to complete surveys when Internet is not available provides more freedom on when and where participants can participate) and fieldwork companies (e.g. the possibility to use push notifications could lead to higher participation rates). However, previous research suggests that panelists may also be reluctant to install an app. In this study, we answer research questions related to the knowledge and use of the Netquest app. We found that a majority of panelist did not know about the app and although sending invitations significantly increased its installation, the overall total of respondents installing the app remained low. Furthermore, the profile of those who installed the app differs from those who did not. The participation of panelists after they installed the app seems stable. The main reason for installing the app is comfort while the main reason for not installing relates to space/battery usage. Most of those who did not install could accept to install the app.

AB  - Some respondents already complete web surveys via mobile devices. These devices vary at several levels from PCs. In particular, we expect differences when grid questions are used due to the lower visibility on mobile devices and because in questionnaires optimized to be completed through smartphones, grids are split up into an item-by-item format. This paper reports the results of a two-wave experiment conducted in Spain in 2015, comparing three groups: PCs, smartphones not-optimized, or smartphones optimized. We found similar levels of interitem correlations, longer completion times for grid questions for smartphone respondents, and sometimes less non-differentiation for PCs. Thus, using the item-by-item format for smartphones and PCs seems the most appropriate way to improve comparability. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - We studied the impact of different layouts for rank order questions on respondent effort, data quality, and substantive results among PC and smartphone respondents, in an experiment in an opt-in online panel in Spain, using an order-by-click design. We experimentally varied the device, the number of columns, and, for smartphone respondents, the position of the 'next' button in questions on trust in institutions.We found some evidence of lower data quality for smartphone users but no evidence that presenting ranking items in one column performs differently than two columns. We also find little evidence that these effects differ by the number of response options presented or the number to be ranked. The placement of the 'next' button had little effect on performance on ranking items. Overall, our findings suggest that the format and layout of order-by-click questions has little effect on data quality, regardless of device used.

AB  - Most survey questions are closed questions, where respondents have to select an answer from a proposed set of alternatives. However, a lot of surveys also include, at least occasionally, some open questions. Open questions that call for elaborated and developed answers, called "open narrative questions", are used when the researchers want to go deeper into what the respondents think. This paper compares the answers to open narrative questions when the respondent is participating in a PC survey, in a smartphone-not-optimised survey or in a smartphone-optimised survey. The experiment was carried out in Spain using data collected by the Netquest online access panel. Respondents were assigned randomly to each type of device and survey format, in two successive waves. Because respondents have to type in their answer, we expect differences between devices, linked with the size and the kind of keyboards (i.e. physical versus digital, touch-screen or not). Differences are observed between answers that come from PCs and smartphones for the response time per written character, for the number of total characters and for the use of abbreviations, but not for the non-answer and non-substantive responses. No differences are observed between optimised and not optimised versions for smartphones, except for the response time per character written.

AB  - Purpose - Despite the quick spread of the use of mobile devices in survey participation, there is still little knowledge about the potentialities and challenges that arise from this increase. The purpose of this paper is to study how respondents' preferences drive their choice of a certain device when participating in surveys. Furthermore, this paper evaluates the tolerance of participants when specifically asked to use mobile devices and carry out other specific tasks, such as taking photographs.
Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected by surveys in Spain, Portugal and Latin America by Netquest, an online fieldwork company.
Findings - Netquest panellists still mainly preferred to participate in surveys using personal computers. Nevertheless, the use of tablets and smartphones in surveys showed an increasing trend; more panellists would prefer mobile devices, if the questionnaires were adapted to them. Most respondents were not opposed to the idea of participating in tasks such as taking photographs or sharing GPS information.
Research limitations/implications - The research concerns an opt-in online panel that covers a specific area. For probability-based panels and other areas the findings may be different.
Practical implications - The findings show that online access panels need to adapt their surveys to mobile devices to satisfy the increasing demand from respondents. This will also allow new, and potentially very interesting data collection methods.
Originality/value - This study contributes to survey methodology with updated findings focusing on a currently underexplored area. Furthermore, it provides commercial online panels with useful information to determine their future strategies.

AB  - Changes in technology, economy, and demography have generated today’s mobile and flexible workplace. These aspects, while leading to more permeable boundaries, render it more difficult to manage the boundaries between life domains. We conducted a quasiexperimental study to evaluate the effects of an intervention teaching mindfulness as a cognitive–emotional segmentation strategy to promote well-being. In all, 191 employees participated in the 3-week online self-training intervention and completed the preintervention– postintervention and follow-up questionnaires. As expected, the experimental group participants compared to the control group participants experienced significantly less emotional exhaustion and negative affect, and significantly more life satisfaction. Moreover, we could show that boundary management competency can be improved with an online-based self-training intervention. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: To review published reports on Web-based treatment and prevention programs for depression, anxiety, and suicide prevention in children, adolescents, and emerging adults. Method: A systematic search of the PsycINFO, PubMed, Medline, and Web of Science databases was conducted in December 2013. Programs were classified according to evidence-base level (Well-Established, Probably Efficacious, Possibly Efficacious, Experimental, and Of Questionable Efficacy). Results: Of the 14,001 citations initially identified, 25 articles met inclusion criteria for Web-based interventions. These described 9 programs, of which 8 were Internet based and 1 was a mobile application. No Web-based interventions for suicide prevention were identified. Of the randomized controlled trials (n = 14) and open trials (n = 3) identified, 10 reported significant postintervention reductions in symptoms of depression and/or anxiety or improvements in diagnostic ratings, with small to large effect sizes. Many of these studies also reported significant improvements at follow-up. The methodological quality of the studies varied. Many programs were limited by their small sample sizes and use of waitlist or no-treatment control groups. Conclusion: There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of Web-based interventions for youth depression and anxiety. Additional research and program development are needed to fill the current gaps in the literature. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Technological advances in the information and knowledge society have influenced and transformed economic, social, and educational dynamics. Currently there are many digital gaps related to the access to technology, level of digital literacy, and social use. These gaps vary based on the age of the population and become more noticeable among elders. Digital illiteracy leads to the underusing of technological developments of the 21st century, making it difficult to take advantage of all the possibilities that they offer to our society. This study aims to analyze the level of penetration and use of handheld digital devices, especially the cellular phone, among the adult population. This study is based on the 2016 National Survey of Life Quality in Colombia, elaborated by Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadística-DANE, specifically on the module of ownership and use of ICT goods. Results of four age groups are compared, which include 32 year olds or under, from ages 33 to 45 years, 46 to 59 years, and over 60 years. The sample consists of 37047 inhabitants of the Colombian territory, grouped by regions (Antioquia, Bogota, Caribbean, Eastern Central, Orinoquia, Amazonia, Pacific, San Andres, and Valle del Cauca). Data have been analyzed by descriptive and inferential statistical procedures, contingency tables analyses, and logistic regression, in order to identify and know the effect of age on the level of penetration and use of handheld digital devices when comparing results in young adults and elderly people. Findings show that young adults use these technologies to a greater proportion when compared to older adults, showing a significant correlation between age and the increase of digital gaps in access and social use of handheld digital devices. Results also make evident that digital divide in Colombia may be associated to the place of residence, as people who live in rural zones are the ones who suffer greater from inequalities.

AB  - Background: Electronic platform surveys are ideal for self-administration in adolescent populations, as nearly all adolescents in the US report using or having access to smartphones. This technology-savvy population seems prepared to graduate away from paper surveys. Despite predicted advantages of using smartphones for data collection, there is a surprising lack of data regarding the use of this mode for surveillance of substance use trends among adolescent populations. Objectives: The objective of this study was to evaluate completion rates, times, and responses of high school students taking the Secondary Student Life Survey: Nevada (SSLS:NV) on their own personal smartphones compared to provided computers or tablets. Methods: The SSLS:NV is a web-based survey designed to assess adolescent beliefs, attitudes, and use-trends surrounding substance use. The SSLS:NV was self-administered via self-selected device (personal vs. provided) within one class period to approximately one thousand 9th–12th grade students in December 2016. Data was collected and analyzed to compare outcomes by computer, tablet, or smartphone. Statistical analysis was performed in SPSS 23.0 using χ² or Fisher’s exact test for categorical data and one-way ANOVA for continuous data. Results: SSLS:NV completion times averaged 21 min overall (p = .193). Differences were seen with completion rates of 86% smartphone 94% tablet, and 95% computer (p < .001), while responses to lifetime substance use were similar across all groups. Conclusions/Importance: The current study provides proof of concept that personal smartphones are effective in achieving more comprehensive adolescent substance use surveillance within a relatively short amount of time, while retaining robust response rates.

AB  - Consumer-facing cybercrime is an increasing concern for individuals and societies. Nevertheless, current estimates of its costs are unreliable and there is no consensus on adequate measurement methods. This article presents a tailored survey instrument, which explicitly asks for monetary and non-monetary cybercrime losses and protection expenses. We collect representative data in a victimization survey of adult Internet users covering seven types of consumer-facing cybercrime in six selected EU member states. Victims are oversampled to increase the number of informative data points in the loss distributions. We use the loss data to evaluate different summary indicators regarding their robustness and precision in depicting the size of the cybercrime problem. We find that the distributions of victim losses and protection expenses are zero-inflated and skewed to the right. Aggregate victim losses are dwarfed by protection expenses at the societal level. A robust harmonized loss indicator allows for comparisons between crime types and across countries. Among the crime types studied, scams cause the severest impact on victims, as opposed to payment-related fraud. From the perspective of method development, our findings offer evidence-based insights to inform the instrument design and data analysis of future survey-based measurements of consumer-facing cybercrime.

AB  - As use of mobile technology grows rapidly, planning agencies experiment and adopt new policies to accommodate this increase. While a significant body of literature has extolled the growth and opportunity this technological change presents, little is looking about its use by local government and urban planning organizations. This research investigates whether planning departments are capable of responding to increased mobile users given their current web and information technology tools, applying a replicable method for benchmarking website capacity. Based on a 2014 survey of planning department websites (N?=?523), this study evaluates whether or not web technology, in planning departments, is tracking growth in mobile technology finding that while 99% of planning agencies have a web presence, very few planning websites have mobile responsive frameworks. Additionally, few websites have online GIS or e-permitting capability. Of those with such capacity, many use a common content management system for data management. These findings offer key design lessons for cities that want to pursue responsive websites that better match the user profile of the trend toward accessing websites from smartphones and tablets?providing useful and timely information to citizens, and respond to changing user needs.

AB  - The emergence of web technology creates tremendous opportunity to advance good government, through increased information, interaction with the public, and cost-effective, efficient means of conducting public transactions. Some have proposed that e-government tools have two major roles: (1) receptive and (2) interactive. We argue that there is a third role for planning and e-government technology ? the transactive. To evaluate this, we survey public sector planning officials on their professional use of mobile technology. Results confirm the recent trends in increased smartphone use, but indicated that only a limited amount of this increased use is for work purposes. We find that there are still planners who not only do not rely on web technologies at all, within even desktop computer access. Furthermore, our results suggest that the current use of mobile technology appears to be less transactive than the literature suggests. This finding provides room for growth in these transactive and more dynamic exchanges, especially with the increasing prevalence of mobile devices. To assist in this, we provide a taxonomy to help define how mobile technology can change planning and local governance. Such a tool can provide a roadmap for increasing transactive exchanges between local government and citizens in the future.

AB  - Background: Second and third generation sequencing technologies have revolutionised bacterial genomics. Short-read Illumina reads result in cheap but fragmented assemblies, whereas longer reads are more expensive but result in more complete genomes. The Oxford Nanopore MinION device is a revolutionary mobile sequencer that can produce thousands of long, single molecule reads. Results: We sequenced Bacteroides fragilis strain BE1 using both the Illumina MiSeq and Oxford Nanopore MinION platforms. We were able to assemble a single chromosome of 5.18 Mb, with no gaps, using publicly available software and commodity computing hardware. We identified gene rearrangements and the state of invertible promoters in the strain. Conclusions: The single chromosome assembly of Bacteroides fragilis strain BE1 was achieved using only modest amounts of data, publicly available software and commodity computing hardware. This combination of technologies offers the possibility of ultra-cheap, high quality, finished bacterial genomes.

AB  - This chapter explains how data-mining-based techniques can be used to discover interesting knowledge from sequences of life events, that is, to find out how people sequence important life events. We illustrate with data from the biographical survey conducted by the Swiss Household Panel in 2002. The focus is on the sequencing of events in the occupational life course and of events, such as starting a union and childbirth, that affect living arrangements. Addressed methods include finding of frequent sequential patterns, identification of discriminant subsequences, and clustering of event sequences. Mining of sequentially organized data has been successfully exploited in many domains such as genetics, device control, and speech recognition as well as for automatic text, customer behavior, and web logs analysis. In the social sciences sequence exploration mainly focuses on state sequences, and consists typically of building typologies by means of the optimal matching approach. In contrast, we focus in this chapter on event sequences rather than state sequences. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - We aim to investigate the impact of marketing science articles and tools on the practice of marketing. This impact may be direct (e.g., an academic article may be adapted to solve a practical problem) or indirect (e.g., its contents may be incorporated into practitioners' tools,which then influence marketing decision making). We use the term 'marketing science value chain' to describe these diffusion steps, and survey marketing managers, marketing science intermediaries (practicing marketing analysts), and marketing academics to calibrate the value chain. In our sample, we find that (1) the impact of marketing science is perceived to be largest on decisions such as the management of brands, pricing, new products, product portfolios, and customer/market selection, and (2) tools such as segmentation, survey-based choice models, marketing mix models, and pre-test market models have the largest impact on marketing decisions. Exemplary papers from 1982 to 2003 that achieved dual—academic and practice—impact are Guadagni and Little (1983) and Green and Srinivasan (1990). Overall, our results are encouraging. First, we find that the impact of marketing science has been largest on marketing decision areas that are important to practice. Second, we find moderate alignment between academic impact and practice impact. Third, we identify antecedents of practice impact among dual impact marketing science papers. Fourth, we discover more recent trends and initiatives in the period 2004–2012, such as the increased importance of big data and the rise of digital and mobile communication, using the marketing science value chain as an organizing framework.

AB  - Using a comprehensive personality model, this study is the first to examine the relationship between a full range of personality traits and cell phone addiction. 346 college students completed an online survey that asked respondents to complete measures of the Big-Five personality traits and measures of materialism and need for arousal, Barratt’s (1959) impulsiveness scale, and a four-item measure of cell phone addiction. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Couched in Mowen’s (2000) 3M Hierarchical Model of Personality, the elemental traits of emotional instability and materialism were positively associated while introversion was negatively associated with cell phone addiction. The central trait of attention impulsiveness exhibited a direct and positive association with cell phone addiction. A significant negative relationship between conscientiousness and all three dimensions of Barratt’s impulsiveness scale (central trait) was found. Several additional relationships between the elemental traits of Mowen’s personality hierarchy and the three dimensions of impulsiveness (central trait) also were uncovered. Study implications and future research directions are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Throughout the history of mobile media devices, an evolution of portable devices like the transistor radio, Walkman, CD player, and the MP3 player has changed the way users consume programming. Studies have been done about the effects of these new technologies on the way Americans consume media programming. With the development of Apple's iPod touch, consumers became able to watch televised programming on wireless web-enabled devices. This study focuses on how the use of mobile devices modify television viewing behaviors of college students. To conduct the study, 560 students at Kutztown University of Pennsylvania were asked to complete a 26-question survey inquiring about their mobile device viewing behaviors, in order to determine their reasoning behind using mobile devices to watch television programming, and their preferred viewing method. At least 63 percent of the respondents reported using a mobile device to watch television programming, 51 percent of the respondents use laptop computers, and 37 percent use a number of other devices, including the iPod, iPod Touch, MP3 player, Kindle, and Nook. Students have an increased flexibility in scheduling causing their viewing behaviors to shift from the previous year, when most of the primarily freshman sample had not yet entered college. The overall use of college students using mobile devices to consume television programming is consistent with previous studies. This study reveals that even though college students have more flexibility in their scheduling, access to video-on-demand, and a wide assortment of web-enabled mobile devices, they still prefer watching television programming on a traditional television set.

A large majority of the comparisons (105/112; 93.75%) reveal television to be used more frequently than Internet or mobile phones (p<1.0E-09). A content analysis of works published in 9 communication journals from 2010 to 2014 indicates a precipitous decline in the attention political communication scholars are giving to television. Meanwhile, there is substantial growth in the focus on new media.

AB  - 5G is considered a key technology for society but its implementation is currently surrounded by controversy. Beyond its technical aspects, 5G has become a question of security and national interest for many States as well as an international policy issue. Technological autonomy and digital sovereignty are increasingly recognised as strategic priorities on a global scale. In this context, the EU's position is unique, basically for two reasons. On the one hand, the EU has unintentionally become part of the playing field in the US-China dispute over technology companies and 5G. On the other hand, any policy of the EU or its Member States is constrained by the nature of 5G as an area of either European or national competence. The delimitation of their competences is not clear, just as there is no transparent and understandable distinction of their 5G responsibilities. In order to clarify this situation, a comprehensive analysis of the European competence and legal frameworks is necessary. After that, the study of the evolution process of this European policy provides an overview of its scope and limits. Finally, the paper explains the procedures and instruments of this European policy and concludes by assessing its implementation and development prospects. The possibility of reaching technological autonomy and digital sovereignty for the EU and its member states depends, for the time being, on this European policy.

AB  - The creation of smart environments that are adaptive and responsive to the context in which they are being used has been one of the strongest ideas in ambient intelligence, but also one of the areas in which there seems to be a persistent gap between the initial promises and its real achievements. A possible reason why this is so challenging is that context-driven interaction and systems support are highly interdependent, but are rarely designed together. In this paper, we analyse the implications of context-driven interaction to the type of systems support provided by smart environments. The analysis is based on the study of previous work in this area and structured around three main dimensions of interaction with smart environments: physical integration; spontaneous interoperation and application programming abstractions. The contributions of this paper are 2-fold: a characterization of the system design space according to the requirements raised by context-driven interaction and the identification of new alternative paths for the integration of context-driven interaction into smart environments. © 2013 The Author.

AB  - Objective: Providing instruction for assembly tasks is essential in modern manufacturing industry, as well as in households for customers that buy products to be assembled at home. Recent technological developments might be able to assist in completing an assembly task faster and more accurately. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether performance and usability differs when instructions for an assembly task are presented on digital glasses versus paper.
Methods: Participants (n = 63) completed one of three versions of an assembly task (between-subject-design) with LEGO (R) bricks: (1) with paper instruction (P), (2) with text instructions presented stepwise via digital glasses (GT), (3) with stepwise text and auditory instruction (in parallel) on digital glasses (GA). Outcome measures on performance were completion time and errors. Furthermore, usability was measured by the User Experience Questionnaire, the Standardized Usability Questionnaire, the Post-Study Usability Questionnaire, and cognitive processing skills were assessed by the Trail Making Test and different versions of the Eriksen Flanker Task. Analyses were adjusted for the confounding factors age, gender, experience with glasses and LEGO, and problems with instruction. Results: Findings indicate that task completion was faster with the paper instructions compared to both versions of instruction via digital glasses (GT, GA). We observed no difference in accuracy and usability between the instructions. "Novelty" was rated higher for instructions for both GT and GA, compared to P.
Discussion: Results show that instructions on digital glasses may not always be more effective for assembly than the traditional paper-based instructions. Further studies are necessary to investigate whether effectiveness may depend on task complexity, target group, experience of the user with task and device, and how the information is presented.

AB  - Memories serve as a 'database' of the self and people may produce distorted memories that support their self-concepts. Dissonance theory suggests self-consistency is a fundamental human motivation. Inconsistency between beliefs and actions leads people to adopt various strategies to effectively restore consonance. Because instances of dissonance are counter to most people's self-concept, people may misremember past dissonance-inducing events in ways that promote their self-concept (i.e., consistency). Current models of memory and motivated cognition, specifically M. A. Conway's (2005) self-memory system (SMS), can incorporate dissonance processes and account for false memories. In the current report, we describe the results of two experiments designed to establish the link between cognitive dissonance and false memories. In Experiment 1 participants made either an easy or a difficult choice between two smart phones. Either immediately or two days later, participants reported their memories for their decision experience and phone specifications. Participants in the difficult choice conditions produced the expected spread of alternatives effect and were more likely than those in the easy conditions to misremember their initial decision as easier and more satisfactory than they had initially rated it. Delay did not influence participants' memories. In Experiment 2, participants either chose or were forced to write a counterattitudinal essay supporting a tuition increase and were afforded the opportunity to reduce dissonance via attitude shift or denial of responsibility by way of a question-order manipulation embedded in a questionnaire. They then reported their memories for the experimental instructions and their initial attitudes (assessed via online questionnaire two days prior to the laboratory session). Participants who chose to write the essay shifted their attitudes to be more favorable toward a tuition increase than those who were forced to write the essay. Additionally, they misremembered their initial attitudes as more favorable toward a tuition increase, and were more likely to misremember the experimental instruction. We did not replicate the denial of responsibility mode of dissonance reduction. Overall, the results from the present studies provide preliminary evidence that cognitive dissonance can yield memory distortion under certain circumstances. Theoretical implications and directions for future research are discussed. Copies of dissertations may be obtained by addressing your request to ProQuest, 789 E. Eisenhower Parkway, P.O.

AB  - We investigate the impact of internet use, mobile phones, and broadband on bilateral trade flows using a dynamic gravity model and panel data for 2004-2013. We find a significant and positive relationship between each type of ICT and bilateral exports, although the impacts vary depending on the type of technology. Our findings suggest that the effect of ICT use is larger for mobile phones and smaller for broadband. The impact on trade is greater for the exporter than for the importer.

AB  - Despite rapid technological development, very few new technology-assisted tools have been developed specifically for use in family services. This article describes a new, mobile-assisted working model designed to enhance the quality of daily family life. The model has its origins in the existing research on daily family life and on the diary method, which has been widely used in data collection in family research. The model provides support for the daily life of client families in the intervals between meetings with family counselors via the use of text messages. The pilot study explored family members’ and family counselors’ experiences of using the model. Data on 26 parents and four children participating in the new mobile-based service were collected via feedback text messages and web questionnaires. The research findings are also based on interviews with family counselors (n = 6). Although clients’ experiences of the model varied widely, the results show that, in general, it was regarded as effective in invoking reflection, keeping the goals of family counseling in mind and implementing family practices at home. On the basis of the experiences of the family counselors, the mobile-based working model offers a new, systematic, and structured tool for use in working with families and monitoring processes in families.

AB  - Mobile device proficiency is increasingly required to participate in society. Unfortunately, there still exists a digital divide between younger and older adults, especially with respect to mobile devices (i.e., tablet computers and smartphones). Training is an important goal to ensure that older adults can reap the benefits of these devices. However, efficient/effective training depends on the ability to gauge current proficiency levels. We developed a new scale to accurately assess the mobile device proficiency of older adults: the Mobile Device Proficiency Questionnaire (MDPQ). We present and validate the MDPQ and a short 16-question version of the MDPQ (MDPQ-16). The MDPQ, its subscales, and the MDPQ-16 were found to be highly reliable and valid measures of mobile device proficiency in a large sample. We conclude that the MDPQ and MDPQ-16 may serve as useful tools for facilitating mobile device training of older adults and measuring mobile device proficiency for research purposes.

AB  - Background: Reptiles are a species-rich group with great phenotypic and life history diversity but are highly underrepresented among the vertebrate species with sequenced genomes. Results: Here, we report a high-quality genome assembly of the tegu lizard, Salvator merianae, the first lacertoid with a sequenced genome. We combined 74X Illumina short-read, 29.8X Pacific Biosciences long-read, and optical mapping data to generate a high-quality assembly with a scaffold N50 value of 55.4 Mb. The contig N50 value of this assembly is 521 Kb, making it the most contiguous reptile assembly so far. We show that the tegu assembly has the highest completeness of coding genes and conserved non-exonic elements (CNEs) compared to other reptiles. Furthermore, the tegu assembly has the highest number of evolutionarily conserved CNE pairs, corroborating a high assembly contiguity in intergenic regions. As in other reptiles, long interspersed nuclear elements comprise the most abundant transposon class. We used transcriptomic data, homology- and de novo gene predictions to annotate 22,413 coding genes, of which 16,995 (76%) likely have human orthologs as inferred by CESAR-derived gene mappings. Finally, we generated a multiple genome alignment comprising 10 squamates and 7 other amniote species and identified conserved regions that are under evolutionary constraint. CNEs cover 38 Mb (1.8%) of the tegu genome, with 3.3 Mb in these elements being squamate specific. In contrast to placental mammal-specific CNEs, very few of these squamate-specific CNEs (<20 Kb) overlap transposons, highlighting a difference in how lineage-specific CNEs originated in these two clades. Conclusions: The tegu lizard genome together with the multiple genome alignment and comprehensive conserved element datasets provide a valuable resource for comparative genomic studies of reptiles and other amniotes.

AB  - Studies into the use of mobile applications (apps) for language learning have found positive results on language improvement and learner engagement, but they have mostly focused on small samples of learners using apps that were selected by a researcher/educator rather than on learners using apps of their own choice. This article presents the results of a large-scale survey (n = 4095) into the use of one of the most popular language learning apps in the market: the busuu mobile app (over 60 million registered users). Data were collected through an online questionnaire with 30 items. The survey was distributed both in English and in Spanish. The results provide a profile of busuu app users, show patterns of use, and what app features learners find most valuable for language learning. Most users are at beginner level and learn for personal interest. They find the app has helped them improve their knowledge of the language they are learning, with vocabulary as the main area of improvement. The high expectations from users and the fact that a third of respondents use busuu as their only language learning source suggest that a large proportion of users consider apps a reliable tool for language learning.

AB  - Background: Many ophthalmic lens manufacturers are currently marketing blue-blocking filters, which they claim will reduce symptoms of Digital Eye Strain (DES). However, there is limited evidence to support the proposal that DES results from the blue light emitted by electronic screens. Objective: This investigation compared the effect of blue-blocking filters on DES symptoms with a no-filter lens, using a double-blind methodology. METHODS: Twenty-four subjects were required to perform a 20-minute reading task from a tablet computer. They wore either lenses containing a blue-blocking filter (TheraBlue 1.67 or TheraBlue polycarbonate) or a CR-39 control lens which did not include a filter. Immediately following each session, subjects completed a questionnaire to quantify symptoms of DES. Results: While a significant increase in symptoms was observed immediately following the near vision task (p = 0.00001), no significant difference in symptoms was found between the 3 lens conditions (p = 0.74). Conclusions: There is little evidence at this time to support the use of blue-blocking filters as a clinical treatment for DES. Management of other ocular factors, as well as the creation of an optimal environment for screen viewing, are more likely to provide greater success in minimizing symptoms.

AB  - With the rising popularity of web surveys and the increasing use of paradata by survey methodologists, assessing information stored in user agent strings becomes inevitable. These data contain meaningful information about the browser, operating system, and device that a survey respondent uses. This article provides an overview of user agent strings, their specific structure and history, how they can be obtained when conducting a web survey, as well as what kind of information can be extracted from the strings. Further, the user written command parseuas is introduced as an efficient means to gather detailed information from user agent strings. The application of parseuas is illustrated by an example that draws on a pooled data set consisting of 29 web surveys.

AB  - This article addresses the questions of whether paradata can help us to improve the models of panel attrition and whether paradata can improve the effectiveness of propensity score weights with respect to reducing attrition biases. The main advantage of paradata is that it is collected as a by-product of the survey process. However, it is still an open question which paradata can be used to model attrition and to what extent these paradata are correlated with the variables of interest. Our analysis used data from a seven-wave web-based panel survey that had been supplemented by three cross-sectional surveys. This split panel design allowed us to assess the magnitude of attrition bias for a large number of substantive variables. Furthermore, this design enabled us to analyze in detail the effectiveness of propensity score weights. Our results showed that some paradata (e.g., response times and participation history) improved the prediction of panel attrition, whereas others did not. In addition, not all the paradata that increased the model fit resulted in weights that effectively reduced bias. These findings highlight the importance of selecting paradata that are linked to both the survey response process and the variables of interest. This article provides a first contribution to this challenge.

AB  - Time-use research can provide important insights for different research questions. However, many time-use measures do not capture seasonal differences, qualitative dimensions of time use, and activities that are considered less ‘important’ or ‘desirable’. To address these issues, this article proposes spot phone calls as a new method for measuring time use. The spot phone calls methodology was piloted as part of a research project on time use of adults and children in northern Uganda. In different periods of the year, participants were called on their phones at different times of the day to be asked about their time use. The method was cost and time effective and made it possible to identify and understand seasonal differences in time use. It captured emotional and relational aspects of time use and accounted for activities that were undercounted in other measures, such as ‘doing nothing’ and men’s participation in unpaid care and domestic work. This article calls for the method to be tested with a larger sample.

AB  - In interface development, it is crucial to reflect the users' expectations and mental models. By meeting users' expectations, errors can be prevented and the efficiency of the interaction can be enhanced. Applying these guidelines to website development reveals the need to know where users expect to find the most common web objects like the search field, home button or the navigation. In a preliminary online study with 136 participants, the most common web objects were identified for three web page types: online shops, news portals, and company web pages. These objects were used for the main study, which was conducted with 516 participants. In an online application, prototypical websites had to be constructed by the participants. Data analysis showed that Internet users have distinct mental models for different web page types (online shop, news portal, and company web page). Users generally agree about the locations of many, but not all, web objects. These mental models are robust to demographic factors like gender and web expertise. This knowledge could be used to improve the perception and usability of websites. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The combination of long reads and long-range information to produce genome assemblies is now accepted as a common standard. This strategy not only allows access to the gene catalogue of a given species but also reveals the architecture and organization of chromosomes, including complex regions such as telomeres and centromeres. The Brassica genus is not exempt, and many assemblies based on long reads are now available. The reference genome for Brassica napus, Darmor-bzh, which was published in 2014, was produced using short reads and its contiguity was extremely low compared with current assemblies of the Brassica genus. Findings: Herein, we report the new long-read assembly of Darmor-bzh genome (Brassica napus) generated by combining long-read sequencing data and optical and genetic maps. Using the PromethION device and 6 flowcells, we generated ∼16 million long reads representing 93× coverage and, more importantly, 6× with reads longer than 100 kb. This ultralong-read dataset allows us to generate one of the most contiguous and complete assemblies of a Brassica genome to date (contig N50 > 10 Mb). In addition, we exploited all the advantages of the nanopore technology to detect modified bases and sequence transcriptomic data using direct RNA to annotate the genome and focus on resistance genes. Conclusion: Using these cutting-edge technologies, and in particular by relying on all the advantages of the nanopore technology, we provide the most contiguous Brassica napus assembly, a resource that will be valuable to the Brassica community for crop improvement and will facilitate the rapid selection of agronomically important traits.

AB  - Although research on smart cars has rapidly expanded, relatively little attention has been paid to improving users' emotional experiences. This research was based on a petmorphic design approach, which defines design attributes assuming an intelligent device can interact like a pet dog. In this paper, we present a set of pet-dog behavioral traits (PBT) and their application in enhancing emotional interaction in smart cars. Firstly, using an interview-based explorative study, we identified key pet-dog characteristics that elicit affection in owners and four PBTs that could be used to design smart car interactions: self-expression, empathy, faithfulness and innocence. Secondly, we conducted an online survey-based study to examine how PBTs can be incorporated into smart cars for different scenarios. The results indicated that faithfulness was typically preferred in routine scenarios while traits associated with innocence were less preferred. We discuss the desirable use cases for each PBT and how PBT can be applied as a function of autonomy according to the urgency of a situation. We also discuss how PBT could enhance users' emotional experiences by increasing agreeability, emotional bonding, delightfulness and generous attitudes.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Google's autocomplete function provides "predictors" to enable quick completion of intended search terms. The predictors reflect the search trends of a population; they capture societal beliefs and perceptions about a variety of subjects. This study explores the predictors provided by Google United States when searching for information about older men and women. Research Design and Methods: The Google search engine of the United States was used to record predictors in response to 720 search terms. Inductive content analysis method was used to categorize and interpret the results. Results: There was prevalence of age and gender stereotypes in the predictors offered by Google. Queries about older men were primarily associated with romance and sexuality whereas those for older women centered on changes in the body as well as sexual and reproductive health. Discussion and Implications: The appearance of such predictors in response to a potential search query may lead to the spread of harmful stereotypes about older adults.

AB  - The aim of the current work was to investigate relations between problematic smartphone use (PSU) severity and intolerance of uncertainty, a transdiagnostic psychopathology construct reflecting individual differences in reacting to uncertain situations and events. In addition, it was tested if use of social and/or non-social smartphone use mediated associations between intolerance of uncertainty and PSU. The effective sample comprised 261 college students. Participants completed a web survey using the Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version (measuring PSU), Social and Process Smartphone Use Scale, and Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale-Short Form. The survey was administered twice, with approximately one month separating two measurement waves. In this paper, the measures of intolerance of uncertainty and social/non-social smartphone use from Time 1 and the PSU score from Time 2 were used. Correlation analyses showed that intolerance of uncertainty and both social and non-social smartphone use are related to Time 2 levels of PSU. In a structural equation model, intolerance of uncertainty was positively associated with non-social smartphone use, but not with social smartphone use. Non-social smartphone use was related to Time 2 PSU severity. Mediation analysis showed that only non-social smartphone use mediated the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and levels of PSU. The study contributes to PSU research by demonstrating that intolerance of uncertainty and PSU are associated, and that non-social smartphone use may drive that relationship. This study emphasizes the need to understand the potential causes for excessive technology use.

AB  - We examined how family communication patterns (FCPs) are associated with frequency of adolescent–parent communication in person, over the phone, via text message, and via email. Adolescents (N = 195) aged 13 to 18 completed an online survey assessing FCPs and frequency of communication methods used with parents. The results revealed that both frequency and method of communication differed by general FCPs; adolescents in higher conformity families reported less frequent text messaging with mothers than adolescents in lower conformity families, and adolescents in higher conversation families (mothers only) and lower conformity families reported more frequent email communication with parents. Results set the stage for future research to further explore the processes and outcomes of adolescent–parent communication through communication technology.

AB  - Adherent dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) includes between-session phone consultation to help clients generalize skills, solve problems during crises, and repair relationships. Despite benefits of phone consultation, it is frequently not implemented in outpatient settings. The perceived burden phone consultation places on providers is one of the most frequently cited reasons for its omission. The current study examined phone consultation in relation to providers' burnout using a cross-sectional design. We hypothesized that (1) DBT experience and support from peer consultation team members, including perceived team efficacy and shared coaching responsibilities, would be associated with lower rates of burnout and (2) higher numbers of crisis contacts and "other" contacts, but not noncrisis skills generalization contacts, would be associated with increased burnout. Participants were 65 DBT therapists who completed an anonymous survey online. Results suggest that both having more effective consultation teams and sharing phone consultation among team members were associated with decreased burnout. Additionally, more crisis contacts were found to be associated with higher burnout, whereas higher number of skills generalization calls was not. This study represents an important first step towards evaluating the impact of phone consultation on providers and highlights the importance of effective peer consultation in reducing therapist burnout.

AB  - Objectives: To test a patient-centered, tablet-based bedside educational intervention in the hospital and to evaluate the efficacy of this intervention to increase patient engagement with their patient portals during hospitalization and after discharge. Materials and Methods: We conducted a randomized controlled trial of adult patients admitted to the hospitalist service in one large, academic medical center. All participants were supplied with a tablet computer for 1 day during their inpatient stay and assistance with portal registration and initial login as needed. Additionally, intervention group patients received a focused bedside education to demonstrate key functions of the portal and explain the importance of these functions to their upcoming transition to post-discharge care. Our primary outcomes were proportion of patients who logged into the portal and completed specific tasks after discharge. Secondary outcomes were observed ability to navigate the portal before discharge and self-reported patient satisfaction with bedside tablet use to access the portal. Results: We enrolled 97 participants (50 intervention; 47 control); overall 57% logged into their portals 1 time within 7 days of discharge (58% intervention vs. 55% control). Mean number of logins was higher for the intervention group (3.48 vs. 2.94 control), and mean number of specific portal tasks performed was higher in the intervention group; however, no individual comparison reached statistical significance. Observed ability to login and navigate the portal in the hospital was higher for the intervention group (64% vs. 60% control), but only 1 specific portal task was significant (view provider messaging tab: 92% vs. 77% control, P ¼ .04). Time needed to deliver the intervention was brief (<15 min for 80%), and satisfaction with the bedside tablet to access the portal was high in the intervention group (88% satisfied/very satisfied). Conclusion: Our intervention was highly feasible and acceptable to patients, and we found a highly consistent, but statistically non-significant, trend towards higher inpatient engagement and post-discharge use of key portal functions among patients in the intervention group.

AB  - My research identifies how social structures affect the use of the Internet and/or a mobile chat application and how the Internet impacts the political structure of a nation. In my first essay of the 3-essay dissertation, I am designing three models based on social structure theory that are used to study the Internet and a popular mobile chat application's use by managers in South Korea, with the help of a survey instrument. In my first essay, the contribution is on i) testing a model of manager's personal behavior on Information and Communication Technology (ICT) use at the individual level involving managers only ii) understanding social structure characteristics that play a part in technology use, iii) linking the theories of technology acceptance, social structure and adoption/use of ICT and iv) comparing constructs that predict the use of e-mail by the Internet and mobile chat using a mobile messaging application (called 'Kakao talk'), applying the well-known Peterson and Smith framework. The second essay studies the relationship between social structures and use of ICTs at the cross-national level using national and multiple-level models. To explore the relationship between the use of e-mail and social structures (roles, rules and norms), a survey instrument is derived from multiple population surveys that include 3,277 managers from 21 European and four Asian countries. The third essay contributes to the development of a model that examines the role of the Internet on democracy development in these four Asian nations using a Partial Least Squares approach for analysis.

AB  - Digital provide consists of electronic media, telecommunications, and computer technologies information and communication technologies (ICTs) availability, accessibility, and utilisation, which simplifies process. The convergence of ICTs ensures efficiency in resources allocation and promotes system growth. This study examines the convergence in global information and communication technologies (ICT) development for 205 countries spanning 2000-2018. We employ the Phillips and Sul econometric methodology, which tests for the existence of convergence clubs and the modelling of different transition paths to convergence. We further disaggregated our panel data into nine regions. We constructed an ICT development index (comprising of mobile line, fixed line, and internet access penetration) via principal component analysis. Our findings suggest the presence of panel convergence at the global and regional levels (except for Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, which exhibited divergence). However, we identified convergence clubs using an iterative testing procedure. The key findings from the club convergence algorithm results suggest that: (i) at the global level, club 1 converges; (ii) at regional levels, Sub-Saharan Africa forms 7 clubs; (iii) clubs 1 in the remaining 8 regions converged. Contrary to previous findings, this study finds that the process of convergence in ICT development reflects the desirable emanations of telecommunication policies sharing similar characteristics, at least to some extent, in terms of the ICT sharing across the globe.

AB  - Adolescents with depression who participate in behavioral activation therapy may find it hard to be motivated to perform tasks at home that their therapists recommend. We describe the initial design and usability evaluation of a home device ('PlantBot') that could be used to remind young adults with depression at home of their behavioral activation therapy-related tasks. The prototype features electronics in a two-layer base, with a fake plant on top and supported using the Amazon Echo voice agent.We use an online panel study to evaluate the usability of our system with youth with past depression (N = 30). Initial findings highlight the device’s usability, potential benefit, and attractiveness of the plant component, as well as multiple improvements to be made.

AB  - This study examines the impact of information communication technology (ICT) on electricity consumption in emerging economies. The empirical results, obtained from dynamic panel demand models, show a positive and statistically significant relationship between ICT and electricity consumption when ICT is measured using internet connections, mobile phones or the number of PCs. Long-run ICT elasticities are smaller than income elasticities but because ICT growth rates are so much higher than income growth rates, the impact of ICT on electricity demand is greater than the impact of income on electricity demand. One implication of these results is that policies designed to close the "digital divide" between developed and developing economics by increasing the adoption of ICT in developing countries are put at odds with energy policies to reduce GHG emissions.

AB  - The present study compared the effectiveness of paper and digital flashcards. College students learned vocabulary from paper, computer, or tablet flashcards that were self-created or ready-made. Students then completed a memory recall test and answered questions on cognitive load, perceived control, satisfaction, and several individual difference variables. Results showed that students learned equally well from paper and tablet but less well from computer flashcards. They were less satisfied with, and felt less in control of, computer-based flashcards. Students also felt more satisfied with paper than either digital card set. Despite these differences, cognitive load was equivalent across platforms. In addition, students recalled more words and reported expelling more effort on ready-made over self-created flashcards. The individual difference variables did not relate to recall or satisfaction. Overall, students’ satisfaction, as well as perceived difficulty and level of control over the cards, meaningfully related to performance. This research suggests that paper and digital flashcards are equally viable options for students but platform matters. Mobile technologies like tablets might be especially advantageous. Furthermore, perceptions matter. Students may be inclined towards different cards based on their perceptions of difficulty level and the like, and thus flashcards should be available in a multitude of formats.

AB  - The breakthrough of GPS-equipped smartphones has enabled the collection of track data from human mobility on massive scales that can be used in route recommendation, urban planning and traffic management. In this work we present a fast map server that can generate and visualize heat maps of popular routes online from massive sports track data based on client preferences, e.g., running routes lasting less than an hour. The heat maps shown respect user privacy by not showing routes with less than a predefined number of different users, for instance five. The results are represented to the client using a dynamic tile layer. The current implementation uses data collected by the Sports Tracker mobile application with over 800,000 different tracks and 2.8 billion GPS data points. Stress tests indicate that the server can handle hundreds of simultaneous client requests in a single server configuration.

AB  - Minimizing unit nonresponse and maximizing reporting accuracy about sensitive items are common goals among survey practitioners. In order to maximize reporting accuracy without compromising on response rates a common strategy is to recruit respondents over the phone and switch them to a self-administered mode (e.g., IVR, web) for answering the sensitive items. A drawback to the "recruit-and-switch" design is that a substantial portion of the sample (typically 20 percent or more) drop out during the mode switch. Recent evidence suggests that this form of nonresponse can introduce bias and offset gains in accuracy achieved by self-administration. We analyze respondents' likelihood of complying with the mode switch request in a survey of university alumni. Results indicate that paradata derived from the screening interview are related to mode switch participation. Also, we find evidence that adding reluctant sample members into the mode switch respondent pool yields improved estimates with lower nonresponse bias. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Background and Objective: Clinical decision support tools for risk prediction are readily available, but typically require workflow interruptions and manual data entry so are rarely used. Due to new data interoperability standards for electronic health records (EHRs), other options are available. As a clinical case study, we sought to build a scalable, web-based system that would automate calculation of kidney failure risk and display clinical decision support to users in primary care practices. Materials and Methods: We developed a single-page application, web server, database, and application programming interface to calculate and display kidney failure risk. Data were extracted from the EHR using the Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture interoperability standard for Continuity of Care Documents (CCDs). EHR users were presented with a noninterruptive alert on the patient's summary screen and a hyperlink to details and recommendations provided through a web application. Clinic schedules and CCDs were retrieved using existing application programming interfaces to the EHR, and we provided a clinical decision support hyperlink to the EHR as a service. Results: We debugged a series of terminology and technical issues. The application was validated with data from 255 patients and subsequently deployed to 10 primary care clinics where, over the course of 1 year, 569 533 CCD documents were processed. Conclusions: We validated the use of interoperable documents and open-source components to develop a lowcost tool for automated clinical decision support. Since Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture-based data extraction extends to any certified EHR, this demonstrates a successful modular approach to clinical decision support.

AB  - The production and distribution of news is changing. At the same time, the relationship between journalism and artificial intelligence systems is becoming stronger. Within this context, conversational bots have appeared, which are software applications that distribute personalised content (Al Johri et al., 2016) through social networks, online instant messaging apps, and mobile devices. This research presents a case study on the conversational political news bot known as Politibot, which is a pioneering, successful Spanish project that emerged during the 2016 election campaign. The study analyses users' perceptions of the bot as a news and conversational tool based on their experience of use. An experimental methodology has been used in combination with other qualitative and quantitative research techniques (documentary analysis, direct observation, registration forms, as well as pre-test and post-test by means of questionnaires). The results show widespread acceptance in terms of reliability, comprehension, and the format regarding the information received from the bot, as well as its immediacy and customisation. However, the possibility of interacting with bots is still limited, which is also true of the case under study herein. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Web tracking is a commonly-used practice on the Internet devoted to retrieve user information for activities such as personalization or advertisement. These techniques are said to drive the web economy, although they are commonly used to invade users' privacy. In the last years, a general concern raised about web tracking, looking forward to combat it in many ways like regulations, anti-tracking methods and even standardization. In this paper, we analyze and discuss the current techniques for web-tracking as well as techniques for its detection and analysis, and countermeasures to prevent web tracking.

AB  - This article reports an ethnographic study of a subsidized computer center for children in an inner-city library. Unsurprisingly, young children play with the Internet. Surprisingly, this creates conflict with the justifications given for such centers by adults and public policy, leading to an atmosphere of tension between differing understandings of the Internet's purpose: as a place for ritual and play vs. as a place for the transmission of information and for work (Carey, 1989). Theories of play based on Huizinga (1950) and Gadamer (1989) are used to explain Internet play. The study finds that the narrowly instrumental rationales of public policy about the digital divide are rehearsed and repeated in everyday conversation at the center, even to the extent that child's play is denaturalized and seen as a problem that must be corrected. © 2006 International Communication Association.

The study adopts the Extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) with Social Value (SV), Monetary Value (MV), Emotional Value (EV), Quality Value (QV), Trust and the moderation effect of gender. Online and offline survey methods were used to collect primary data from 457 Indian consumers using mBanking. SPSS AMOS was utilized to empirically validate the conceptual model, test research hypothesis and moderation effect. The factors effort expectancy (EE), monetary value (MV), emotional value (EV), quality value (QV) and trust (TR) were found to be significant on behavioural intent (BI), whereas performance expectancy (PE) and social value (SV) were not found to be significant. Banking organizations can formulate strategies to attract new consumers and continue to engage in retaining consumers in using these influencing factors to adopt mBanking and other related mobile financial services (MFS). The study integrates perceived value components and trust with UTAUT2 to form a comprehensive model for examining mBanking adoption.

AB  - Using technology to create new types of questions is important, but also exploring new types of test representations or analyzing the most adequate technological device to support a specific assessment activity based on tests. This paper presents a conceptual model that defines and relates three dimensions to be considered for advancing on Computing-Based Testing (CBT): the Question-item, the Test and the Activity. The framework assists in the categorization and design of advanced CBT scenarios and opens a new domain for questions and tests supported by ICT. Besides, the paper proposes two models for the technological design and implementation of the Test and Question-item dimensions. The models represent an extension of the IMS Question and Test Interoperability standard. They are platform-independent models (PIMs) that formulate the elements that can be mapped to platform-specific models (PSMs) for implementing advanced CBT solutions. To show the relevance, value and usability of the contributions, the paper also describes the application of the framework and PIMs to design and implement three exemplary CBT scenarios with their corresponding CBT-PSMs. Within the global scope of the CBT conceptual model, the first scenario shows how question-items can be enriched with specific multimedia information (web maps). The second scenario illustrates another particular case of the CBT domain where a test can be augmented with real physical elements. And finally, the third scenario describes an implementation that combines advanced question-items and tests using virtual worlds. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The increasing relevance of personal information has sparked a broad debate on privacy issues on the ubiquitous Internet. The so called 'privacy paradox' aims to explain through rational decision-making models the contradictions between stated digital privacy concerns and the actual behaviors in mobile platforms. An analysis of the emotions that arise when users know about unauthorized personal data disclosure is proposed. A survey of smartphone users was conducted shortly after the Cambridge Analytica / Facebook scandal took place, in order to analyze the nature and intensity of a user's emotions in relation to their knowledge of privacy breaches. The results support the paradox of privacy from an emotional perspective: although the reported emotions are intense, there is no relationship between the management that users make of their privacy settings in social networks and mobile applications and the nature and intensity of the emotions reported.

AB  - University academic faculty in Pakistan are facing greater pressures and higher workload from their jobs. It was hypothesized that faculty face quantitative, cognitive, and emotional demands on their jobs which would positively impact their experience of conflict arising from work and affecting family roles. A sample of 425 public sector faculty member from Pakistan filled an online survey questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of demographic information, Work to Family Conflict Scale-Short Form (Kacmar, Wayne, Carlson, Ferguson, & Whitten, 2014), and Job Demands Scale consisting of four items adopted by Experience and Evaluation of Work (Van Veldhoven & Meijman, 1994). Findings of t-test revealed that female faculty perceived significantly higher work-to-family conflict and cognitive demands compared to male faculty, while there was no gender difference in perceptions of quantitative and emotional demands. The hypothesized model was tested using structural equation modeling and a good fit was achieved. The direct relationship between quantitative and emotional job demands with work to the family conflict was significant and between cognitive job demands and work to family conflict was insignificant. No gender-based variance was found in the hypothesized model. The results can provide guidelines for the university administration to device effective work-family policies.

AB  - Though tourists can search for necessary information on the internet while sightseeing, it takes effort and is inconvenient to obtain available information related to specific sightseeing spots among the copious amount of information online. Targeting urban tourist areas in Japan, the present study aims to develop a system that can provide guidance and information concerning sightseeing spots by integrating location-based augmented reality (AR) and object-recognition AR and by using pictograms. The system enables users to efficiently obtain the directions to sightseeing spots and nearby facilities within urban tourist areas and sightseeing spot information. Additionally, the city of Chofu in the metropolis of Tokyo was selected as the operation target area. The operation of the system was conducted for 1 month, targeting those inside and outside the operation target area, and a web questionnaire survey was conducted with a total number of 50 users. From the evaluation results of the web questionnaire survey, the usefulness of the original functions of integrating location-based AR and object-recognition AR and by using pictograms, as well as of the entire system, was analyzed. From the results of the access analysis of users' log data, it is expected that users will further utilize each function. Additionally, it is evident that location-based AR was used more often than was object-recognition AR.

AB  - This study investigated the prevalence and antecedents of the so-called phantom phone sensations (PPS) phenomenon - the false perception that one's cell phone is ringing, vibrating, or blinking. While previous studies have already addressed the impact of personality traits and cell phone usage patterns on the likelihood of experiencing phantom phone sensations, we were interested in additionally addressing the impact of situational context factors. An online questionnaire assessed especially cell phone usage patterns (e.g., frequency of cell phone usage), personality traits (e.g., Big Five, need for popularity), and contextual factors (e.g., awaiting a call, being in a noisy environment). Analyses (N = 249; 137 female) revealed that the majority of participants (83.5%) have experienced phantom phone sensations. Multivariate analysis methods indicated that, in particular, contextual factors regarding the social situation (awaiting a call) along with cell phone usage patterns are predictive for the experience of phantom phone sensations. Moreover, age was also found to have a high predictive value.

AB  - Study of Health and Activity in Preschool Environments (SHAPES) aimed to increase preschoolers' physical activity by engaging preschool teachers in professional development designed to modify instructional practices. SHAPES originated as a randomized controlled trial, tested in 16 preschools and disseminated to 4 control schools, and was shown to be effective in increasing preschool children's physical activity (Phase I, 2008-2012). This article describes the steps taken to translate an evidence-based physical activity intervention, SHAPES, from in-person delivery to online delivery of professional development to preschool teachers. In Phase II (2013-2016), professional development delivery was modified from an in-person to an online program for preschool teachers. Teacher implementation completeness and fidelity were examined in 10 pilot preschools and then replicated in 30 preschools. Large-scale dissemination of SHAPES began in Phase III (2017-2019), reaching 818 teachers from 228 unique centers after 2 years. The final SHAPES program consisted of six online modules, an accompanying guidebook, over 90 activities, self-assessment techniques, a video library, and an electronic community forum. The SHAPES core elements, defined in Phase I, were retained throughout all three phases. The Phase II change to online delivery was characterized by high levels of implementation completeness and fidelity. Results of Phase III statewide dissemination revealed comparable implementation completeness and fidelity. An intervention shown to be effective in a randomized controlled trial can be translated into an online professional development program and disseminated on a large scale in a timely manner.

AB  - Background: What, when, how, how much, and how often infants are fed have been associated with childhood obesity risk. The objective of this secondary analysis was to examine the effect of a responsive parenting (RP) intervention designed for obesity prevention on parents’ infant feeding practices in the first year after birth. Methods: Primiparous mother-newborn dyads were randomized to the Intervention Nurses Start Infants Growing on Healthy Trajectories (INSIGHT) Study RP intervention or child safety control. Research nurses delivered intervention content at home at infant age 3–4, 16, 28, and 40 weeks, and at a research center at 1 year. RP feeding guidance advised feeding that was contingent (i.e., feed in response to hunger and satiety signs, alternatives to using food to soothe), and developmentally appropriate (i.e., delaying introduction of solids, age-appropriate portion sizes). Infant feeding practices (i.e., bottle use, introduction of solids, food to soothe) were assessed by phone interviews and online surveys and dietary intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire. Results: RP mothers were more likely to use of structure-based feeding practices including limit-setting (p < 0.05) and consistent feeding routines (p < 0.01) at age 1 year. RP group mothers were less likely to use non-responsive feeding practices such as pressuring their infant to finish the bottle/food (p < 0.001), and using food to soothe (p < 0.01), propping the bottle (p < 0.05) assessed between 4 and 8 months, and putting baby to bed with a bottle at age 1 year (p < 0.05). Few differences were seen between groups in what specific foods or food groups infants were fed. Conclusions: Anticipatory guidance on RP in feeding can prevent the use of food to soothe and promote use of more sensitive, structure-based feeding which could reduce obesity risk by affecting how and when infants are fed during the first year.

AB  - This paper presents findings of a pilot study which used pedagogical agents to examine disclosure in educational settings. The study used responsive evaluation to explore how use of pedagogical agents might affect students' truthfulness and disclosure by asking them to respond to a lifestyle choices survey delivered by a web-based pedagogical agent. Findings indicate that emotional connection with pedagogical agents was intrinsic to the user's sense of trust and therefore likely to affect levels of truthfulness and engagement. The implications of this study are that truthfulness, personalisation and emotional engagement are all vital components in using pedagogical agents to enhance online learning.

AB  - Based on a 3-year ethnographical study, this paper discusses the prolonged use of computer-mediated communication (CMC) tools by approximately 400 older people in an adult education centre in Barcelona (Spain). Contrary to oversimplified views of older people as ICT users, this paper shows that they make a very rich use of CMC tools. Relevant elements of this use are their permanent desire to feel and be included, social, independent and competent ICT users. Despite the numerous interaction issues they face when using ICT, some are constant across different tools. Difficulties due to cognition limit their interactions more severely than those problems due to perceiving visual information or using the mouse. By examining the longitudinal aspect of the study, this paper addresses the evolution of technology use and whether the interaction issues that most of the current older people exhibit will be relevant when today's more ICT literate young adults grow older. Interaction issues due to cognition are time-persistent, and independent of both experience and practice with ICT. Difficulties reading from the screen or using input devices are overcome with ICT experience. The strategies adopted by older people for coping with all these interaction issues are always targeted at feeling and being included, social, independent and competent ICT users. The results deepen current understanding of tools use in connecting older people with their social circles and the interaction issues most of them encounter when using ICT. The results also suggest that cognitive-related problems will be the most important ones in our work with the next generation of older people. © 2011 British Informatics Society Limited.

AB  - Navigation in virtual environments on desktop systems is known to be problematic. Research into the usability of the tools presented on two-dimensional interfaces indicates that, for even relatively simple tasks, users experience some degree of frustration. As the user community broadens with an increasing range of applications and services making use of three-dimensional presentation, the usability of these interfaces becomes ever more important. In this paper, we describe the results of an experiment performed to evaluate the usability of a number of visual navigation tools and the effect for two age groups (18-45 and 46 +). Results indicate that, for both age groups, the visual presentation of navigational aids improves navigation performance in terms of both time taken to complete tasks, and user satisfaction with the system. In all experimental conditions younger participants achieved better performance times, although the gap between the groups decreased when a choice of navigation aids was presented. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background This study examined the relationship between substance use motives (i.e., social, conformity, coping and enhancement) and substance use in individuals with mild intellectual disability or borderline intellectual functioning (MID-BIF). Method Data were collected among 163 clients with MID-BIF using interactive questionnaires with visual cues on a tablet with a web application. Results Results show that social motives were positively related to frequency of alcohol use, while conformity, coping and enhancement motives were positively related to severity of alcohol use. Results for drug use show that social motives were positively related to frequency of cannabis and hard drug use and that conformity motives were negatively related to frequency of cannabis use. Coping motives were positively related to severity of drug use. Conclusions Insight in substance use motives should be used when adapting interventions, as it could contribute to the prevention and reduction of substance use disorders in individuals with MID-BIF.

AB  - Wizard of Oz(WOZ) is a well-established method for simulating the functionality and user experience of future systems. Using a human wizard to mimic certain operations of a potential system is particularly useful in situations where extensive engineering effort would otherwise be needed to explore the design possibilities offered by such operations. TheWOZ method has been widely used in connection with speech and language technologies, but advances in sensor technology and pattern recognition as well as new application areas such as human-robot interaction have made it increasingly relevant to the design of a wider range of interactive systems. In such cases, achieving acceptable performance at the user interface level often hinges on resource-intensive improvements such as domain tuning, which are better done once the overall design is relatively stable. AlthoughWOZ is recognized as a valuable prototyping technique, surprisingly little effort has been put into exploring it from a methodological point of view. Starting from a survey of the literature, this paper presents a systematic investigation and analysis of the design space forWOZ for language technology applications, and proposes a generic architecture for tool support that supports the integration of components for speech recognition and synthesis as well as for machine translation. This architecture is instantiated inWebWOZ-a new web-based open-sourceWOZ prototyping platform. The viability of generic support is explored empirically through a series of evaluations. Researchers from a variety of backgrounds were able to create experiments, independent of their previous experience withWOZ. The approach was further validated through a number of real experiments, which also helped to identify a number of possibilities for additional support, and flagged potential issues relating to consistency in wizard performance.

AB  - In this article, we present a study on the data quality and the response process of mobile online surveys using an experimental design as compared to a standard computer. We used the following indicators to measure data quality and response properties: reaction time to survey invitation, break-off rate, item nonresponse, length of responses to open-ended questions and survey transmission, processing, and completion time. With regard to completion time, we also explored the significance of the place as well as the situation in which the survey was completed, the kind of Internet connection the respondents had as well as the hardware properties of the devices used to answer the online survey. Our results suggest comparable data quality and response properties in most aspects: There were no noticeable differences between computer and mobile users as regards break-off rate, item nonresponse, and length of responses to open-ended questions, nor the place where the survey was completed. However, it took respondents in the mobile group longer to complete the survey as compared to respondents answering the online survey on their computer. In terms of the completion time, there was a significant decrease in the differences between mobile devices and PCs when respondents used technically advanced mobile devices and had access to a fast Internet connection.

AB  - Explored whether free associations are psychometrically suitable for the assessment individual differences in attitudes. Study 1 measured attitudes toward East and West Germans with free associations. 52 participants including 29 East Germans and 23 West Germans (mean age 24 years) completed an attitude questionnaire and a continued free association task by phone. Study 2 examined the relationship of free associations with explicit and implicit attitudes. Data from 284 participants (mean age 28 years) including 100 East Germans and 184 West Germans was collected online. Results showed that whereas the specific content of the associations was rather unstable both within and across measurement points, independent judges rated their evaluative meaning as highly stable both in terms of internal consistency and stability over a 3-week interval. Findings also demonstrated good convergent validity between valence of associations estimates and attitude (Ossi-Wessi) implicit association test (IAT) and provided evidence that valence estimates of free associations are a composite of both implicit and explicit attitudes. Free associations are suggested as an alternative implicit measure to the explicit assessment of attitudes.

AB  - Two of the most important developmental tasks in adolescence are developing autonomy and establishing relationships (i.e., friendships and romantic relationships). Self-socialization processes are relevant in mastering these developmental tasks. Mobile media are predestined as tools for such self-socialization: Their affordances-universality, private accessibility, and ubiquity-closely match the developmental needs of adolescents and no other media device is so deeply embedded in adolescents' daily lives. The present paper proposes a reciprocal relationship between mobile media and communication and mastery of developmental tasks. The results of a three-wave panel study (N = 503) point to a marginal role of mobile media and communication in developing autonomy and establishing relationships. Still, results suggest that developmental achievements enable adolescents to make sensible use of mobile media and communication in response to their current developmental stage.

AB  - Smartphones are ubiquitous and frequently used in copresent interactions. This behavior is often seen as inappropriate and thus has been termed phubbing, compromising the words “phone” and “snubbing.” Although being a worldwide phenomenon, little is known about what predicts phubbing behavior in the first place. Drawing on injunctive norms (i.e., what ought to be done), the study’s aim was to shed light on the relationship between mobile phone norms (MPN) and phubbing behavior. Furthermore, the role of being permanently online and permanently connected (POPC) and fear of missing out (FOMO), reflecting approach and avoidance orientations, respectively, as additional predictors and moderators was investigated. As expected, the findings of an online survey (N = 278) supported the assumption that MPN were negatively related to phubbing behavior. Moreover, results showed that both FOMO and POPC were significantly positively connected to phubbing behavior but did not play significant moderating roles concerning the norm–phubbing relationship.

AB  - This article describes the development and implementation of a web-phone system to support care managers in delivering services to clients. The cloud-based system, called Teleherence, delivered a series of voice or text statements as well as questions that could accept responses from clients. Based on these responses the system branched to additional statements or questions or performed other tasks such as playing an audio file. The four Teleherence applications described point to the potentials and challenges of implementing new technology into existing services. Potentials were for more effective services especially with clients who had the time and capability to handle more extensive care management communications. Key challenges included integrating Teleherence into antiquated agency technology, the changes in work habits and policies required to handle increased care manager–client communications, including support for unstructured treatment communications and practices, protecting the security and privacy of client data and digital communications, agency staff turnover and reorganizations due to budget cuts, and developing a system using university resources in the context of rapid changes in mobile phone technology. This report suggests the road ahead in human services web-phone automation offers much potential, but is typically difficult, time consuming, and can substantially change how services are delivered.

AB  - This article presents and discusses three different approaches to the exploration of the cross-media challenges facing news audiences, as they seek access to, navigate in and make sense of the multitude of news sources across print, broadcasting, online and mobile media platforms. From a modernized uses and gratifications perspective, based on the notion of “worthwhileness” as the determinant of people's everyday selections from the “supermarket of news”, the article first reports from a longitudinal survey study in Denmark in which the author's foundational mapping of cross-media news consumption in pre-mobile 2008 is compared with replicating mappings carried out in 2011 and 2012, in a collaborative project between academics and news publishers. The analytical interest here focuses on the fluctuations between traditional news media and the surging digital news outlets of the internet and mobile devices. Secondly, the article summarizes the findings of a qualitative study of citizens' news repertoires, which was fortified with a quantitative factor analysis in order to find patterns in people's news consumption. Thirdly, findings are presented from a 2013 study that explored ubiquitous news consumption, asking respondents to specify the nexus of news platform and location of use. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

AB  - Purpose: We report the results of a study designed to assess whether and how much potential individual end users are willing to pay for Quality of Life Technologies (QoLTs) designed to enhance functioning and independence. Design and Methods: We carried out a web survey of a nationally representative sample of U.S. baby boomers (aged 45-64; N = 416) and older adults (aged 65 and greater, N = 114). Respondents were first instructed to assume that they needed help with kitchen activities/personal care and that technology was available to help with things like meal preparation/dressing, and then they were asked the most they would be willing to pay each month out of pocket for these technologies. Results: We modeled willingness to pay some (72% of respondents) versus none (28%), and the most people were willing to pay. Those willing to pay something were on average willing to pay a maximum of $40.30 and $45.00 per month for kitchen and personal care technology assistance, respectively. Respondents concerned about privacy or who were currently using assistive technology were less willing to pay. Respondents with higher incomes, who were Hispanic, or who perceived a higher likelihood of needing help in the future were more willing to pay. Implications: Consumers' willingness to pay out of pocket for technologies to improve their well-being and independence is limited. In order to be widely adopted, QoLTs will have to be highly cost effective so that third party payers such as Medicare and private insurance companies are willing to pay for them. © 2013 The Author.

AB  - Background The digitalisation of literature is proliferating, and the increasing spread of digital reading devices and the availability of digital texts is likely to make books on screen a lasting phenomenon, but little attention has been paid to the consequences of digitalisation for the experience of narrative fiction. While on the one hand, reading literature on a digital reading device might trigger a superficial processing of the text, and problems regarding orientation within the narrative, the awareness of reading a literary text might, on the other hand, lead to more in-depth and complex processing, independent of reading medium. This study examines whether the reading performance and the emotional and cognitive experiences of the reception of a literary text vary between reading a printed book or an e-reader.
Methods Using a between-subjects experimental design, 207 participants read the beginning of a novel either in a printed book or on an e-reader. They then completed a reading comprehension test and questionnaires about their cognitive and emotional experiences.
Results Overall, the results do not suggest the clear superiority of either of the two reading media. Neither reading speed nor reading comprehension differed significantly between the two groups. Even though a broad range of reading experiences was measured, neither cognitive nor emotional reading experiences differed significantly between the groups.
Conclusion An e-reader does not affect either reading performance or cognitive and emotional experience of reading a narrative text, compared with a printed book.

AB  - Cloud computing refers to subscription-based, fee-for service utilization of computer hardware and software over the Internet. The model is gaining acceptance for business information technology (IT) applications because it allows capacity and functionality to increase on the fly without major investment in infrastructure, personnel or licensing fees. Large IT investments can be converted to a series of smaller operating expenses. Cloud architectures could potentially be superior to traditional electronic health record (EHR) designs in terms of economy, efficiency and utility. A central issue for EHR developers in the US is that these systems are constrained by federal regulatory legislation and oversight. These laws focus on security and privacy, which are well-recognized challenges for cloud computing systems in general. EHRs built with the cloud computing model can achieve acceptable privacy and security through business associate contracts with cloud providers that specify compliance requirements, performance metrics and liability sharing.

AB  - Objectives: Teachers often wonder what students are doing during lectures, behind their computers, mobile phones and other digital tools. This study aimed to document the type of tools used during lectures by nursing students and what they do with them. Methods: We carried out a descriptive, prospective, multicentre study including 1446 nursing students in Alsace (France). The students filled in an anonymous questionnaire at the end of a lesson they had just attended. Results: 99% of the students had taken at least one digital tool to the lesson. 90% had a mobile phone with them. It was mainly used for entertainment (particularly for sending and/or receiving text messages and consulting emails). 52% had a laptop with them. It was essentially used for academic tasks (taking notes, working on other teaching units or revising for exams). Conclusion: Most nursing students take a phone or laptop to lectures with them with the intention of using them for entertainment and learning respectively. These results could guide training establishments in drafting their institutional policy concerning the use of digital tools in class. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - There are many ways of placing error messages in web forms. A study of web conventions shows that the most common approach is to display error messages embedded in the form at the top of the entire form. Six frequent locations (right, left, above and below the erroneous input field, as well as on the top and at the bottom of the form) were tested in an online study with n = 303 participants. Results of efficiency, effectiveness and satisfaction show that the locations near the erroneous input field lead to a significantly better performance than the error messages on the top and at the bottom of the form; in addition error messages on the right side of the erroneous input field were subjectively evaluated as the most satisfying and intuitive by participants. The results indicate possible improvements for online shops, where error messages are currently mostly placed on the top of the form. © 2012 British Informatics Society Limited.

AB  - More and more older people are using smartphones or tablet computers; for many it is a viable substitute for a normal mobile phone, or even an entry into the new digital age. With mobile devices, older people can use mobile Internet at home or on the move. Smartphones and tablets allow mobile access to information and communication, so it provides a mobile guide for older adults in their daily lives. But what is the level of acceptance and use of mobile Internet in the older population, and what factors influence the use of these devices? This paper examined older Swiss peoples' acceptance of and attitudes toward the use of smartphones and tablet computers, as well as mobile Internet. A representative study was conducted: a Swiss survey of 1,037 people aged 65 and older. 56% of the older people interviewed used the Internet in the autumn of 2014. 32% of the interviewed owned a smartphone and 26% a tablet computer. Between the age groups and the sociodemographic groups a divide by the mobile devices was found. 34% of Internet users also use mobile Internet. The data showed that, beside lower age, technological affinity and general attitude towards the Internet are positively associated with the use of mobile Internet. The research also showed that many mobile Internet users describe the use of their smartphone as a resource for coping with daily living.

It is indicated, that the mobile digital calendars are not only perceived especially value adding in a highly mobile work context and when using a central company calendar is mandated, but also in other user groups overall satisfaction with this type of calendar tool seems high. Mobile digital calendars seem to answer the needs of a highly mobile and temporally pressured user group. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Technology is a mobile and integral part of many work places, and computers and other information and communication technology have made many users’ work life easier, but technology can also contribute to problems in the cognitive work environment and, over time, create technostress. Much previous research on technostress has focused on the use of digital technology and its effects, measured by questionnaires, but in order to further examine how technostress arises in the modern workplace, a wider perspective on interactions between people and technology is needed. This paper applies a distributed cognition perspective to human–technology interaction, investigated through an observational field study. Distributed cognition focuses on the organisation of cognitive systems, and technostress in this perspective becomes an emergent phenomenon within a complex and dynamic socio-technical system. A well-established questionnaire was also used (for a limited sample), to gain a frame of reference for the results from the qualitative part of the study. The implications are that common questionnaire-based approaches very well can and should be complemented with a broader perspective to study causes of technostress. Based on the present study, a redefinition of technostress is also proposed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Multicommunicating via mobile phone during face-to-face encounters with family and friends was examined with data from an online survey of 432 adults in the US. Multicommunicating was positively associated with problematic mobile phone use and explained by attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms and a social need to belong. Those with ADHD symptoms were more likely to engage in problematic mobile phone use and frequent multicommunicating. Strong need for social assurance, which involves an "always-on-and-connected" lifestyle through mobile devices, explained problematic mobile phone use and multicommunicating. Need for social assurance also was related to multicommunicating via social connectedness, and this effect was significant among females, but not males. The implications of these findings for future research are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In this article, we examine the epistemology of the camera today. In order to answer this question, we concentrate on three social and technological forms: the camera obscura, the photographic camera, and the digital camera. On the one hand, the camera extends our human sensibilities and helps us to obtain knowledge of the world. On the other hand, it works as a device for delusion, bodily vision and spectacle. Historically, these two functions are meshed together in complicated ways and this establishes the paradoxical epistemology of the camera. We argue that, even if contemporary debates about the truthfulness of the photographic image have persistently been tied to the digitisation of the photographic process, the very origin of these debates actually lies in the camera itself and its contradictory epistemology. The camera has worked, and still works, as an apparatus that relentlessly produces irresolvable ambiguity, aporia, between true knowledge and illusory vision. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - University classrooms have been taken over by a new type of student, the "plurimodalicts". This society is characterized by the different ways its students relate to ICTs. This article analyses where, how and for what a sample of 451 students from five Spanish public universities use their laptop computers. The study uses an incidental non-random cluster sample design. Data collection was conducted via questionnaire based on a five-point Likert scale. The questionnaire was divided into three sections: computer use; location and frequency of use of the device; and laptop functions and applications. The study concludes that "plurimodalicts" use their laptops to produce academic work, as well as for exchanging class notes and searching for information. The distance or direct learning methodology and the respondent's gender also determine laptop use for academic tasks, which is greater at distance learning institutions and is more prevalent among women than men. These devices are mainly used at home and, in the case of the younger respondents, also in university libraries. The laptop functions vary according to age group, and the device is mostly used for gaming and as a study tool by the youngest students.

AB  - Engaging in positive healthy lifestyle behaviors continues to be a public health challenge, requiring innovative solutions. As the market for voice assistants (Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple Siri) grows and people increasingly use them to assist their daily tasks, there is a pressing need to explore how voice assistant (VA) technology may be used in behavioral health interventions. A scoping review of literature was conducted to address a PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) question: across populations, how does the use of voice assistants in behavioral health research/ interventions influence healthy lifestyle behaviors versus control or comparison interventions? To inform the science, a secondary aim of this review was to explore characteristics of VAs used in behavioral health research. The review was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines with scoping review extension (PRISMA-ScR). Ten studies satisfied the inclusion criteria, representing research published through February 2019. Studies spanned pediatric to elderly populations, covering a vast array of self-management and healthy lifestyle behaviors. The majority of interventions were multicomponent, involving more than one of the following behavior change techniques grouped by cluster: shaping knowledge, self-belief, repetition and substitution, feedback and monitoring, goals and planning, antecedents, natural consequences, comparison of behavior, and identification. However, most studies were in early stages of development, with limited efficacy trials. VA technology continues to evolve and support behavioral interventions using various platforms (e.g., Interactive Voice Response [IVR] systems, smartphones, and smart speakers) which are used alone or in conjunction with other platforms. Feasibility, usability, preliminary efficacy, along with high user satisfaction of research adapted VAs, in contrast to standalone commercially available VAs, suggest a role for VAs in behavioral health intervention research.

AB  - Rising demand for parking at suburban transit stations, such as the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) District in San Francisco, California, necessitates strategies to manage traveler demand. To better manage parking supply, researchers implemented a smart parking field test at the Rock-ridge BART station from 2004 to 2006 to evaluate the effects of smart parking technologies [changeable message signs (CMSs), Internet reservations and billing, mobile phone and personal digital assistant communications, and a wireless parking lot counting system] on transit ridership and response to service pricing. Researchers used expert interviews, Internet surveys, focus groups, and parking reservation data to conduct this analysis. Survey data indicated that the field test increased BART trips and resulted in 9.7 fewer miles per participant per month on average. Key lessons learned include that it would have been beneficial to anticipate additional time for project scoping and permitting, and that fixed wayfinding signs were beneficial in terms of both directing vehicles from the highway to the smart parking lot and addressing resident concerns about increased traffic. In addition, most participants continued to use the service when fees were implemented. However, CMSs were not widely employed in users? decision-making processes in this application. Finally, the wireless counting system worked well, with the exception of the in-ground sensors, which were prone to miscounts.

AB  - This article explores which antecedents explain intentions to adopt a mobile coaching app. To that end, this study describes a coaching service designed to guide/encourage students throughout their studies in order to validate a new model of planned behavior based on the Technology Acceptance Model and the Goal-Directed Behavioral theory. The methodology included a short qualitative study and an online survey to examine the theoretical model which is based on scales tested in previous studies. The convenience sample is composed of students (Bachelor and Master/MBA) with the results analyzed using structural equation modelling to test the proposed model’s causal structure. The results show different adoption patterns by gender and type of school. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Purpose: This study investigates the neck/shoulder pain (NSP) and low back pain (LBP) among current high school students in Shanghai and explores the relationship between these pains and their possible influences, including digital products, physical activity, and psychological status. Methods: An anonymous self-assessment was administered to 3,600 students across 30 high schools in Shanghai. This questionnaire examined the prevalence of NSP and LBP and the level of physical activity as well as the use of mobile phones, personal computers (PC) and tablet computers (Tablet). The CES-D (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression) scale was also included in the survey. The survey data were analyzed using the chi-square test, univariate logistic analyses and a multivariate logistic regression model. Results: Three thousand sixteen valid questionnaires were received including 1,460 (48.41%) from male respondents and 1,556 (51.59%) from female respondents. The high school students in this study showed NSP and LBP rates of 40.8% and 33.1%, respectively, and the prevalence of both influenced by the student’s grade, use of digital products, and mental status; these factors affected the rates of NSP and LBP to varying degrees. The multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that Gender, grade, soreness after exercise, PC using habits, tablet use, sitting time after school and academic stress entered the final model of NSP, while the final model of LBP consisted of gender, grade, soreness after exercise, PC using habits, mobile phone use, sitting time after school, academic stress and CES-D score. Conclusions: High school students in Shanghai showed high prevalence of NSP and LBP that were closely related to multiple factors. Appropriate interventions should be implemented to reduce the occurrences of NSP and LBP. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Due to increasing internet and mobile penetration, children in India are at risk of cyberbullying. A survey of 174 middle graders in Delhi showed that, of total, 8% indulged in cyberbullying and 17% reported being victimized by such acts. However, prevalence of in-person bullying, fighting and victimization by either was 16%, 12% and 17% respectively. Males were more likely to bully and fight in-person than females. They were also more likely to be victims of both online and offline aggression. Interwoven modes of bullying along with safe use of technology need to be understood.

AB  - Nurses communicating with patients who are unable to speak often lack access to tools and technologies to support communication. Although mobile communication technologies are ubiquitous, it is not known whether their use to support communication is feasible on a busy hospital ward. The aim of this study was to determine the views of hospital nurses on the feasibility of using mobile communication technologies to support nurse-patient communication with individuals who have communication impairments. This study involved an online survey followed by a focus group, with findings analyzed across the two data sources. Nurses expected that mobile communication devices could benefit patient care but lacked access to these devices, encountered policies against use, and held concerns over privacy and confidentiality. The use of mobile communication technologies with patients who have communication difficulties is feasible and may lead to improvements in communication and care, provided environmental barriers are removed and facilitators enhanced.

A field survey of 245 Hong Kong real estate agents showed that their mobile instant messaging (MIM) use and affordances were positively associated with job performance, job satisfaction, and relational satisfaction, and with online bridging and bonding social capital. While bridging capital was not associated with any of the three outcomes, bonding social capital was positively related to the two satisfaction measures. However (with one small exception), neither type of social capital mediated relationships between MIM use and affordances, and employee outcomes.

AB  - The rapid adoption of mobile phones, particularly in developing countries, has led a number of researchers to investigate their impact on socioeconomic activity in the developing world. However, until the recent advent of smart communication devices, mobile phones were primarily a relations management technology that enabled people to stay connected with each other. In this article, we focus on this basic function and analyze how people use this technology as a tool to expand their social capital. We use a dataset containing more than three billion call detail records from Rwanda’s largest telecommunication operator, covering the whole country during the period from 1 July 2014 to 31 March 2015, and combine these records with data from the fourth Integrated Household Living Conditions Survey conducted by the National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda in 2015. We found that people’s calling patterns significantly correlated with the income level of their region, which also dictated the destinations of their calls, with middle-income regions acting as a link between the richest and the poorest regions. From these results, we propose a framework for understanding the role of mobile phones in the development of social capital.

AB  - Chinese classrooms, whether on school grounds or online, have long suffered from a lack of interactivity. Many online classes simply provide recorded lectures to which students listen after downloading. This format only reinforces the negative effects of passive non-participatory learning. At the e-Learning Lab of Shanghai Jiaotong University researchers and developers actively seek technologic interventions that can greatly increase interactivity in blended classes. They developed a cutting-edge mobile learning system that can deliver live broadcast of real-time classroom teaching to online students with mobile devices. Their system allows students to customise means of content-reception, based on when and where the students are tuning in to the broadcast. The system also supports short text messaging and instant polls. Through these venues, students can ask questions and make suggestions in real time, and the instructor can address them immediately. Here we describe this system in detail, and also report results from a test implementation of the system with a blended classroom of 1000 students (250 campus and 750 online).

AB  - This study examines whether and how network size is associated with diversity and trust in the mobile SNS context. Online survey data (N = 327) on Chinese WeChat users reveal that both personal network size and extended network size are positively related to the diversity of people's social networks. We believe the explanation for these findings may be that the affordances of WeChat provide users opportunities to accumulate a wide spectrum of relations ranging from strong ties, weak ties to latent ties and thus a larger network can enable them to access to more diverse resources. We also find that extended network size is negatively related to people's trust in their WeChat contacts. We argue that the increasing size of the extended network may reduce familiarity, certainty and accountability that assumed to be prerequisites of trust. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In the information age, where all answers are just a click away, curiosity, the intrinsic drive to learn, becomes of paramount importance. How easy is it to prime for curiosity and what are its effects? What simple interventions can be used to enable curiosity-driven behaviors? We have conducted a large-scale study to address these questions, using a novel curiosity-based application (app) on university applicants. Using the same app, we addressed the issue of curiosity assessment, which in recent years has mainly been performed via self-reporting questionnaires. The curiosity assessment tool was developed in order to assess curiosity via an objective, quantitative and digital way. The tool measured several behavioral aspects during a free and task-less interaction with the tablet app. From the recorded activity logs we calculated quantitative behavioral measures related to their exploration patterns. We show that a single word can prime the participants and induce better learning of their self-explored knowledge. We also show that by simply enabling more time to explore, without the ability to stop at will, induces more exploration and more learning. Finally, we show that our behavioral measures, obtained with the digital quantitative assessment tool, are significant predictors of the participants’ self-reported curiosity and Psychometric Entrance Test scores. These results suggest that simple priming for curiosity and enabling enough time to explore improve self-paced learning, and that a relatively simple and short interaction with a digital app can greatly improve state-of-the-art curiosity assessment.

AB  - This exploratory research considers the implications to actual world (AW) nations and attachments of an online virtual world (OVW) which mimics so many aspects of AW nation-states. Using Lessing's interrogation of mimesis as a framing device, this paper presents the results of a quantitative investigation that examines the relationship between the competing loyalties of AW nations and the OVW of Second Life (SL). To that end, a subsample of 212 members of SL completed an online survey which measured five aspects of the national and SL attachment, including a section in which participants ranked their concern for fellow co-nationals (CNs) versus their concern for fellow Second Lifers (SLers). Analyses of the data produced four main findings. First, 45 per cent of participants ranked their concern for their fellow SLers above that of their fellow CNs. Second, those who preferred SLers were significantly less attached to their AW nations than those who preferred CNs. Third, the SLer-preferred, on average, considered SL to be like a world, while the CN-preferred were more ambivalent in this regard. Fourth, gender differences indicate that males who preferred SLers spent most of their time in the SL engaged in activities while females who preferred SLers spent most of their time in the SL engaged in communicatory socializing. Discussion of these results focuses on notions of cosmopolitanism versus nation-statehood and uses the category of gender to illustrate the implications of mimesis to the durability of the phenomenon of nation-statehood.

AB  - In recent years, digital learning has been converting from e‐learning to m‐learning because of the significant growth of wireless and mobile computing technologies. Students can learn any time and any where with mobile devices. Consequently, context‐aware ubiquitous learning (u‐learning) is emerging as a new research area. It integrates wireless, mobile and context awareness technologies in order to detect the situation of the learners and provide more seamless adaptive support in the learning process. In this paper, a context‐aware u‐learning environment is developed for learning about campus vegetation in elementary schools based on an innovative approach by employing repertory grid method in designing learning content. In addition, we probe the feasibility of context‐aware u‐learning in courses by soliciting feedback from the students and teachers through interviews and questionnaires. The findings reveal that the environment is capable of enhancing students’ motivation and learning effectiveness. Moreover, it is also capable of reducing the teaching load while enabling better control of class order. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - BackgroundPersonal Mobility Device (PMD) refers to ?Smart Mobility? or ?Micro Mobility? for one or two persons, and it is appreciated as an environmental-friendly means operated by electric resources (Burns, 2013). According to Transparency Market Research in 2016, the world?s personal transport market is expected to grow two times bigger from 2014 to 2023. In fact, PMD has various product types, competence levels and safety problems, so it cannot help covering many user experiences (UXs). Thus, this study aimed to analyze previous researches about PMD in terms of UX and usability.MethodIn this study, 160 papers were collected through five search engines with keyword combinations of UX (e.g., user interaction and interface) and PMD (e.g., Segway and electric vehicle). Through two filtering processes, the 19 papers were finally selected, and each was analyzed by the next six criteria; device types, research environments, participants, user experience factors, UX evaluation methodologies, and UX measurement.ResultsThe results showed that Segway was the most common device type rather than electric vehicles, powered wheelchair, proposed product, E-scooter, E-bicycle, and E-bike. In addition, the outdoor environment accounted for the biggest percentage of researches beyond indoor, semi-outdoor, and online survey. People who participated in researches were usually expert and novice, who got used to handle the assigned PMD for each paper. A total of 26 UX factors (e.g., effectiveness, safety, usability, and acceptability) was collected and classified considering each experimental context; safety and usability turned out to be the most two important factors. From the UX methodological view, the PMD were usually evaluated by a questionnaire rather than by objective methods, which enable the participant to give more instinctive reactions and the researchers to gather quantitative data easily. In this way, UX objective measurements on previous researches were categorized into body observation (e.g., body angle on device), usage behavior (e.g., running distance) and compatibility on field (e.g., riding against traffic).Discussion  OMF), effectiveness, device performance, efficiency, and physical load (subjectively measured factors; SMF). Satisfaction included intuitive, customer-services-quality, charging, operability, comfort, predictability, mobility, and maintainability (SMF). Acceptability included compatibility (OMF), aesthetics, device learnability, cost, and training (SMF). Safety included stability, risk behavior (OMF), independency, guard, controllability, security, and testability (SMF).These results implied that most UX factors for PMD were usually measured subjectively rather than objectively. In particular, satisfaction had not been measured objectively even though it plays a significant role in UX factors with usability, acceptability, and safety. In other areas, some researches used objective measurements such as heart rate, EEG, or action log for sensing satisfaction (Gao, 2012; Taylor, 2015), so it is also possible to measure PMD satisfaction using objective methods.In this study, the previous researches about UX and PMD were analyzed to identify the trend of the UX research of PMD. A total of 19 papers were collected and classified by device type, research environment, participants, UX factors, evaluation method, and objective measurements. As a result, it was found that various UX factors were introduced, and the systematized UX factors framework was proposed. Through this UX framework, we expect to apply more objective measurements on UX factors of PMD in future researches.

AB  - Objectives: We described and evaluated the 2009–2010 Pennsylvania Influenza Sentinel School Monitoring System, a voluntary sentinel network of schools that report data on school absenteeism and visits to the school nurse for influenza-like illness (ILI). Methods: Participating schools provided daily absenteeism and ILI data on a weekly basis through an online survey. We used participation and weekly response rates to determine acceptability, timeliness, and simplicity. We assessed representativeness by comparing participating schools with nonparticipating schools. We compared monitoring system data with statewide reports of laboratory-confirmed influenza. Results: Of the 3244 Pennsylvania public schools, 367 (11%) enrolled in the system. On average, 79% of enrolled schools completed the survey each week. Although the peak week of elevated absenteeism coincided with the peak of statewide laboratory-confirmed influenza cases, the correlation between absenteeism and state data was nonsignificant (correlation coefficient = 0.10; P = .56). Trends in ILI correlated significantly with state data (correlation coefficient = 0.67; P < .001). Conclusions: The school-based sentinel system is a simple, acceptable, reliable device for tracking absenteeism and ILI in schools. Further analyses are necessary to determine the comparative value of this system and other influenza surveillance systems. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the current clinical practice in approaches to bimodal programming in the United States. To be specific, if clinicians are recommending bimodal stimulation, who programs the hearing aid in the bimodal condition, and what method is used for programming the hearing aid? Method: An 11-question online survey was created and sent via email to a comprehensive list of cochlear implant programming centers in the United States. The survey was sent to 360 recipients. Results: Respondents in this study represented a diverse group of clinical settings (response rate: 26%). Results indicate little agreement about who programs the hearing aids, when they are programmed, and how they are programmed in the bimodal condition. Analysis of small versus large implant centers indicated small centers are less likely to add a device to the contralateral ear. Conclusions: Although a growing number of cochlear implant recipients choose to wear a hearing aid on the contralateral ear, there is inconsistency in the current clinical approach to bimodal programming. These survey results provide evidence of large variability in the current bimodal programming practices and indicate a need for more structured clinical recommendations and programming approaches.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) is  widely used in research and clinical settings. However, little is known about the use of the CANTAB in the local aging context. This study aimed to develop normative data for various CANTAB measures in community-living older adults in Singapore. Normative data were built using the regression-based approach. A secondary aim was to examine the concurrent validity of CANTAB measures with their traditional neurocognitive test counterparts. METHOD: A total of 210 older adults (Mage = 67.27 years, SD = 5.45) from an existing cohort study completed standard neurocognitive tests and a CANTAB battery. A total of 160 were normal aging, 46 diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and one diagnosed with Dementia. Older adults with MCI and Dementia were not included in the calculation of norms but were included in other analyses. For the CANTAB battery, regression-based norms were generated for each CANTAB measure, with age, sex, and education included as covariates. Concurrent validity was examined by correlating the CANTAB measures with their traditional neurocognitive counterparts. RESULTS: As expected, performance across most CANTAB measures declined significantly with increasing age and decreasing education levels. There were no significant effects of sex on most CANTAB measures. Our study also showed that some CANTAB measures demonstrated good concurrent validity as they significantly correlated with their traditional neurocognitive test counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed age, sex, and education-specific CANTAB norms for use in the local aging context. The advantages and challenges of using the CANTAB in the local aging context are discussed.

AB  - A number of novel problematic behaviors have emerged in the information technology era, and corresponding addictions have been proposed for some of these behaviors. Scholars have speculated that a common factor may underlie these information technology addictions, but this theoretical notion has yet to be tested empirically. The present study tested this notion and also investigated the relationships of information technology addictions with other behavioral addictions as well as substance addictions. We conducted an online survey in 1001 US adults (56% female; mean age = 35.0 years, range =18-83). Two conceptual models were formulated and tested. Moreover, correlations of the information technology addictions with both problematic gambling and alcohol use disorder were examined. The confirmatory factor analysis showed that there was a common factor underlying various types of information technology addiction. In addition, problematic gambling was more strongly correlated with information technology addiction than alcohol use disorder was. Our findings are interpreted in light of a spectrum approach, which conceptualizes information technology addiction as a cluster of disorders comprising not only shared risk factors and symptoms but also distinct characteristics. The findings further reveal that information technology addiction is more similar to other behavioral addictions than substance related addictions. Implications for researchers and practitioners are discussed. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the overall context of negative social phenomena, organized crime takes a special place, given its constant presence and trend toward expansion, as well as its tendency to be expressed through new forms that are characterized by a high level of organization classification and internationalization, while, at the same time, adjusting to the socioeconomic and political relations of each country. The question of the phenomenological dimensions of organized crime, which is the subject of this article, is especially significant. The phenomenological dimension of organized crime is its organized structure of criminal behaviour, the change in that structure and the formal manifestations of organized forms. In this context, one can talk about the statics and dynamics of organized crime and the typology of its forms. One can thereby form a picture of the various forms of organized crime and try to clear up some of its criminological phenomena (in addition to its etiological and victimological phenomena). Design/Methodology/Approach: Literature review has been carried out in order to determine the structure and content of organized crime. In the process of writing this article, the author primarily used a method of content analysis that includes an analysis of available sources and reports of official authorities (domestic and international) and other relevant materials. Findings: Organized crime is a negative and harmful occurrence in all societies, including in Bosnia and Herzegovina ("BiH"). It is characterized by its ease of adaptation to socioeconomic and sociopolitical conditions, and especially its adaptation to the conditions of countries, of which BiH is one. Therefore, the article surveys organized crime in BiH, with particular reference to the characteristics and conditions of organized crime in BiH and its demonstrated forms therein. One characteristic of organized crime is that, influenced by global social changes, it has undergone significant changes. These changes indicate that some forms have been actualized, while others have just appeared. In this context, traditional activities of organized crime are observed, including: drug trafficking, trafficking in human beings, smuggling of various goods and services (arms and ammunition, artwork and other taxable goods), corrupt business enterprises, organized violent crime, etc. Newer forms of organized crime including: gambling on the Internet (online sports betting, casinos, money-laundering schemes, etc.), manipulation of stock markets (rising-falling schemes), mortgage fraud (unfair assessments, dishonest lenders, insurance fraud), credit card fraud, usurous telephone prices ("sky-high" phone bills), cyber-crime, etc. It also is important to emphasize the appearance of new ways of organizing criminal groups in so-called criminal networks as transnational criminal collectives and to point out the specific results of this form of organization and activity by criminal groups. Some of these phenomena are present in BiH, and they demand an adequate institutional and legal reaction. Global social changes that have occurred over the past twenty years have given rise to new phenomena, such as technological development, migration, the transnational transfer of capital and services, open markets, etc. Practical implications: The purpose of this article is to assess new forms of organized crime in BiH and the institutional and criminal responses to them. The results of this article may be applied in the assessment of the new forms of organized crime that have been caused by global changes and may provide institutional and criminal law proposals (de lega ferenda), which would lead to the successful prevention and combating of these forms of crime.

AB  - Background: Existing studies on the association between physical activity (PA), screen based time and sleeping show conflicting results. Objective: This study investigates the association between chronic pain at different body regions and self-reported PA, screen based time and sleeping hours in high school students. Subjects: A total of 969 students aged 13–19 years old. Methods: Participants completed a questionnaire on chronic pain, time spent in moderate and vigorous PA, screen based time watching television (TV)/digital versatile discs (DVD), playing, using mobile phones and computers and sleeping hours. Univariate and multivariate associations between pain and PA, screen based time and sleeping hours were investigated. Results: In the univariate model time spent in moderate and vigorous PA, in screen based activities and sleeping were associated with pain in at least one body site. In the multivariate model, screen based activities were not associated with pain; sleeping 7 h or less and increased time in moderate PA were associated with pain at almost all body sites [odds ratio (OR) between 2.69–3.66 and 1.06–1.10, respectively]. Conclusion: Time spent in PA and sleeping increased the risk of chronic pain in almost all body regions and might confound the association between screen based time and pain.

AB  - Effective response to natural or man-made disasters (i.e., terrorism) is predicated on the ability to communicate among the many organizations involved. Disaster response exercises enable disaster planners and responders to test procedures and technologies and incorporate the lessons learned from past disasters or exercises. On May 31 and June 1, 2002, one such exercise event took place at the Camp Lejeune Marine Corps Base in Jacksonville, North Carolina. During the exercise, East Carolina University tested: (1) in-place Telehealth networks and (2) rapidly deployable communications, networking, and data collection technologies such as satellite communications, local wireless networking, on-scene video, and clinical and environmental data acquisition and telemetry. Exercise participants included local, county, state, and military emergency medical services (EMS), emergency management, specialized response units, and local fire and police units. The technologies and operations concepts tested at the exercise and recommendations for using telehealth to improve disaster response are described.

AB  - The study attempts to identify the influential antecedents of customer satisfaction and repatronage intentions in the context of e-grocery retailing through mobile applications. Literature survey based on qualitative thematic approach was adopted for the study. The reviewed articles were selected based on Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) framework. The model was subjected to reliability and validity determination through Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). The hypotheses were tested through Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). SEM results revealed that out of the four proposed antecedents i.e. online tracking, design aesthetics, online rating & review, and perceived security risk, the initial three bear significant positive causal relationship with customer satisfaction. The existing study gives a perspective of e-grocery retailing based mobile applications in an emerging market, which is a departure from the past studies which are based on developed markets characterized by higher technology penetration and awareness amongst inhabiting populace.

AB  - This paper presents an innovative multifaceted architecture, named energy-efficient framework for DTV broadcast over Wi-Fi networks (eWU-TV), that provides an energy efficient, user-centric, adaptive digital television (DTV) broadcast over Wi-Fi. To cater to the varied properties of the user equipments (UEs), the proposed framework broadcasts DTV content in the form of scalable video coded content that is adapted to suit the subscribers’ requirements. The user-centricity is in terms of UE device display size, user preferences for video quality profile based on device energy saving, and UE transmission technology support (DVB-T/H or Wi-Fi). Mathematical models on device battery discharge, quality of experience, and user preference are devised that closely approximate the results of device battery discharge experiments on DTV reception by heterogeneous devices over Wi-Fi/DVB-T, subjective video quality assessment study, and statistical survey of user preference. The proposed eWU-TV performance optimization framework is based on the developed models. The framework ensures that the adaptive scalable broadcast reception via Wi-Fi serves more number of users with higher quality of user experience and with provisions for significant device energy saving.

AB  - Objective: This study assessed the effect of a handheld computer-based decision support system (DSS) on antibiotic use and patient outcomes in a critical care unit. Design: A DSS containing four types of evidence (patient microbiology reports, local antibiotic guidelines, unit-specific antibiotic susceptibility data for common bacterial pathogens, and a clinical pulmonary infection score calculator) was developed and implemented on a handheld computer for use in the intensive care unit at a tertiary referral hospital. System impact was assessed in a prospective "before/after" cohort trial lasting 12 months. Outcome measures were defined daily doses (DDDs) of antibiotics per 1,000 patient-days, patient length of stay, and mortality. Results: The number of admissions, APACHE (Acute Physiology, Age, and Chronic Health Evaluation) II and SAPS (Simplified Acute Physiology Score) II for patients in preintervention, and intervention (DSS use) periods were statistically comparable. The mean patient length of stay and the use of antibiotics in the unit during six months of the DSS use decreased from 7.15 to 6.22 bed-days (p = 0.02) and from 1,767 DDD to 1,458 DDD per 1,000 patient-days (p = 0.04), respectively, with no change in mortality. The DSS was accessed 674 times during 168 days of the trial. Microbiology reports and antibiotic guidelines were the two most commonly used (53% and 22.5%, respectively) types of evidence. The greatest reduction was observed in the use of β-lactamase-resistant penicillins and vancomycin. Conclusion: Handheld computer-based decision support contributed to a significant reduction in patient length of stay and antibiotic prescribing in a critical care unit.

AB  - 3D virtual worlds are becoming increasingly popular as tool for social interaction, with the potential of augmenting the user's perception of physical and social presence. Thus, this technology could be of great benefit to older people, providing home-bound older users with access to social, educational and recreational resources. However, so far there have been few studies looking into how older people engage with virtual worlds, as most research in this area focuses on younger users. In this study, an online experiment was conducted with 30 older and 30 younger users to investigate age differences in the perception of presence in the use of virtual worlds for social interaction. Overall, we found that factors such as navigation and prior experience with text messaging tools played a key role in older people's perception of presence. Both physical and social presence was found to be linked to the quality of social interaction for users of both age groups. In addition, older people displayed proxemic behavior which was more similar to proxemic behavior in the physical world when compared to younger users. © 2012 British Informatics Society Limited.

AB  - This paper introduces and explores cycles of pre-produsage and produsage. It reports on the results from an online ethnographical study of the Apple iPad conducted before the public release of the material product. Consequently, most users had not physically interacted with the device in question. Nevertheless, the release of the technical specifications and marketing material generated a massive amount of produsage-related online discussion. As such this paper explores the concept of pre-produsage. Pre-produsage is a form of predicted or expected use, relating to products or services that are only accessible to users as a form of representation (e.g. technical specification, virtual prototype, and design sketch), but with an added element of user-generated design suggestions, conflict coordination, and software development. Remediationthe process by which new digital media technologies reuses qualities of previous technologies and enters an existing media ecologyis a prevalent theme in pre-produsage and involves a tension between features that support protracted use and features that provide total innovation. The paper argues that an analysis of pre-produsage can provide insights that relate to both anticipated and actual user experience (UX). More specifically, pre-produsage analysis can trace the underlying reasons for a certain problem, intention, or concern and connect it to a specific set of features and potential solutions. Finally, the paper shows how proprietary products become subject to produsage, resulting in artifacts negotiated by cycles of produsage.

AB  - Stated preference (SP) web surveys are increasingly completed on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets instead of computers. Due to differences in technical attributes and response contexts of the devices, this trend may affect the quality of the survey data and elicited welfare measures. Little is known of such device effects in SP research. In the first such study of its kind, we compare willingness to pay (WTP) and response quality between devices in a large, national contingent valuation survey. Propensity score matching is used to distinguish device effects from observed sample composition effects due to self-selection. We find significantly higher WTP for smartphone respondents in the first out of four sequential WTP questions, and no differences for tablets. Concerning data (response) quality, results are mixed, but not consistently lower for smartphones and tablets compared to computers. Measured by indicators of response randomness, shares of don't know and protest zeros, smartphone responses even show signs of higher quality. Only in terms of the extent of internal scope sensitivity, do smartphones and tablets fare somewhat worse than computers. Overall, our results do not indicate substantial loss of response quality or differences in welfare measures for mobile devices.

AB  - Given the increasingly important role the World Wide Web plays as an information source, and yet with the continuing problems that certain individuals, particularly those with disabilities and those using 'non-standard' Web browsing technology, it is vital that web resource providers be aware of design features which introduce barriers affecting the accessibility of on-line information. The role of the accessibility audit is seen as an important one in uncovering, describing, and explaining potential accessibility barriers present in a web site. It furthermore acts as an educational tool by raising awareness in accessible design amongst web designers and content providers in providing them with a recovery plan for improving the accessiblility of the audited resource, and potentially other resources. In 1999, the authors were commissioned to carry out accessibility audits of 11 web sites in the UK Higher Education sector. This paper discusses the development of the methodology used to carry out the audits, the findings of the audits in terms of accessibility levels of the subject sites, and feedback as a result of the auditing process. It concludes by looking at ways in which the methodology adopted may be tailored to suit specific types of web resource evaluation. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Follow-up for ongoing management and monitoring of patients is important in clinical practice and research. While common, telephone follow-up is resource intensive and, in our experience, yields low success rates. Electronic communication using mobile devices including smartphones and tablets can provide efficient alternatives ? including SMS (text), online forms and mobile apps. To assess attitudes towards electronic follow-up, we surveyed 642 parents and carers at Perth Children?s Hospital, targeting demographics, device ownership and attitudes towards electronic follow-up. Mobile phone ownership was effectively universal. Almost all respondents were happy to communicate electronically with the hospital. Promisingly, 93.2% of respondents were happy to receive follow-up SMSs from the hospital and 80.3% were happy to reply to SMS questions. There was less enthusiasm regarding other modalities, with 59.9% happy to use a website and 69.0% happy to use a mobile app. The results support the introduction of electronic communication for follow-up in our paediatric population.

AB  - We describe an exploratory investigation of a dynamic digital map, inspired by videogame design. Participants followed a novel route through an urban environment, using a custom map that presented directional information for off-screen landmark locations. Spatial orientation (pointing to remembered landmarks) in this group was compared to participants using a static version of the same custom map (without the directional cues) and an additional control group that used a static mobile map from the public domain. Participants using the dynamic map were most accurate in making egocentric orientation judgments, although groups did not appear to differ in their configural spatial knowledge. These data suggest that landmark persistence may help users to build more accurate on-line representations of their spatial orientation.

U.S. teleworkers (N = 384) completed an online survey and self-reported on dimensions of communication channel satisfaction, job satisfaction, and personality. Results indicated that extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness are positively correlated with job satisfaction. Additionally, significant moderating effects were found for the relationship between openness and phone and video communication, and agreeableness and phone communication on job satisfaction. Findings from this study yield important practical implications for organizations including suggestions for optimizing communication satisfaction for employees of differing personality types and recommendations to help organizations effectively hire and retain teleworkers.

AB  - Tools and other artifacts can be seen as extensions of our human selves. For example, hand tools can be seen as extensions of the hand's ability to grasp, strike, or dig, and vehicles extend the ability of our legs to take us places. Likewise, information technology (IT) tools can extend and support the limited cognitive systems and abilities of humans. For example, memory storage systems, from writing tablets to books to digital memory devices, vastly extend the limits of our long-term memories. The use of computer windows, or any device with active files, can foreground information far beyond the limitations of our human working memory capacity, functionally extending this important cognitive ability. Cognitive systems upon which we rely every day include lower-order cognitive systems, such as sensation, perception, pattern recognition, working memory, and long-term memory; as well as higher-order cognitive systems, such as language systems, concept formation, visualization, and reasoning. What does cognition have to do with creativity? How can IT tools extend and enhance the cognitive systems and abilities that give rise to creative ideas? How can the efficacy of IT tools for enhancing creativity be analyzed and tested empirically? This chapter addresses these questions. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In this article, the author explores the use of electronic devices when they enter the treatment room in child and adolescent psychoanalytic therapies. Smolen demonstrates through the clinical material of two adolescent patients, how electronic devices enter the treatments in a pathological and malignant way. She continues to demonstrate through the treatments of another adolescent and a latency child how the use of devices acted as transitional objects and allowed both children to progress in their treatments, however she continues to question the optimal use of such devices in these treatments. Smolen finishes by demonstrating how a young child used the electronic device to communicate difficulties with separation and how she was able to work through these conflicts and move on to more age appropriate play. Finally, Smolen demonstrated how by prohibiting such devices and working with parents her patient was able to access his creativity and ability to play.

AB  - The topic of this chapter is social relations among disabled youths in Norway and the opportunities or barriers that are associated with information and communication technology (ICT). This chapter focuses on the significance of personal computers (computers) and mobile phones (mobiles) to inclusion and exclusion processes for disabled youth in relation to their peer group, social capital, and identity negotiations. Specifically, the chapter discusses when, how, for whom, and with what consequences ICT can provide new opportunities or create new barriers for disabled youths to participate in social relations. It illustrates how engagement in digital communication and interaction is vital to social participation by describing the experiences of Norwegian disabled youths between the ages 15 and 20 as they interact with ICT as a form of communication. The chapter concludes that ICT enhances opportunities for social relationships through: Communication and interaction with peers on the 'digital town square;' Participation in shared digital activities, on and around the computer screen; Displaying and sharing digital competencies, in real and in virtual contexts; and Taking part in the permeability of the real and the virtual in everyday life. However, the chapter also illustrates how ICT can create inhibiting barriers for young disabled people. These barriers are found to emerge in settings where the interactive use and account of ICT is experienced by the young disabled people as: Discouraging of social relationships; Difficult, confusing, and exerting; and A risky social setting where ICT becomes a tool for harassment. Breaking down disabling barriers and the purposeful provision of equal opportunities for participation and development for disabled people is a declared goal in official Norwegian documents (Norwegian Official Report, 2001, p. 22; White Paper no. 40, 2002-2003). The government claims that removal of disabling barriers in society, including those created by technology, and increased accessibility is vital if this goal is to be achieved. In achieving the goal of removing disabling barriers, the Norwegian government points to a need for more social research on the interactions between environments, disabling barriers, and the consequences of social change (Full Participation for All? Development Trends, 2001-2006; Government's Action Plan for Increased Accessibility, 2004; Ministry of Modernisation, 2009; State of Affairs on Accessibility in Norway, 2006). This chapter explores social changes in communication and interpersonal interaction and also illustrates how the increasingly widespread dissemination and utilization of ICT in the population can mediate new opportunities for communication, interaction, and participation for many disabled youths. On the other hand, ICT can also create new barriers for disabled youths. In the abundant literature on theories guiding the field of ICT and young people in general, Livingstone (2003) found two key questions to be essential. (1) Are young people a special group? (2) Is ICT a distinctive technology? In writing this chapter, I acknowledge three broad assumptions guiding the field. First, I recognize the fact that children and youth play a key role in establishing emerging ICT-related practices. Second, I recognize a need to go beyond the issue of access and contextualize ICT uses and impacts within everyday life. Third, I recognize that new technology not only adds to the existing mix of available technology but also transforms the way in which the latter are perceived and used (Livingstone, 2003). ICT manifests in diverse practices that vary as much as the contexts in which it is used. Thus, ICT, social context, and action are found to be an inseparable phenomena, each influencing each other (Lievrouw & Livingstone, 2006; Valentine & Holloway, 2002).

AB  - Objective: The World Wide Web (WWW) is a new communications medium that permits investigators to contact patients in nonmedical settings and study the effects of disease on quality of life through self-administered questionnaires. However, little is known about the feasibility and, what is more important, the validity of this approach. An on-line survey for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and patients whose UC had been treated with surgical procedures was developed. To understand how patients on the WWW might differ from those in practice and the potential biases in conducting epidemiological research in volunteers recruited on the Internet, post-surgery patients who responded to the WWW survey were compared with those in a surgical practice. Setting: The Internet and private practice surgical clinic. Main outcomes: Scores from the Short form 36 (SF-36) Health Assessment Questionnaire and the Self-Administered Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ). Results: Over a 5-month period, 53 post-surgery patients enrolled in the Internet study; 47 patients from a surgical clinic completed the same computer-based questionnaire. Surgically treated patients on the WWW were younger than their clinic counterparts (median age category 35-44 years vs. 45-54 years, p = 0.01) but more ill with a lower summary IBDQ score (168 vs. 186, p = 0.019) and lower health status across almost all dimensions of the SF-36 (p = 0.016). Conclusions: It is feasible to conduct epidemiological research on the effects of UC on quality of life on the Web; however, systematic differences in disease activity between volunteer patients on the WWW and "in the clinic" may limit the applicability of results.

AB  - Genetic Algorithms may be used together with Pareto Optimality in the process of selection of a suitable video content adaptation strategy, the former to return best or fittest solutions that have evolved over many generations and the latter to evaluate and rank each generation's solutions against a set of objectives without the need to assign weights to each one. The outcome of this is a Pareto front of optimal strategies, all of which would satisfy the objectives. The distribution of optimal strategies on a Pareto front, however, suggests that there may be a 'best-fit' optimal strategy. This article refines the process of selection of an optimal strategy by taking into account this distribution alongside user preferences, video content characteristics and usage history. In order to make the refined process dynamic, it pursues its implementation using Self-Organising Neural Networks. © The Author 2008.

AB  - The number of respondents who access web surveys on a mobile device (smartphone or tablet) has been increasing rapidly over the last few years. Compared with desktop computers, mobile devices have smaller screens, different input options, and are used in a larger variety of locations and situations. The suspicion that the quality of data may suffer when online respondents use mobile devices has stimulated a growing body of research, which has mainly focused on paradata and web survey design. To investigate whether the respondents? device affects the quality of web survey data, we examined the responses of 1,826 mobile-device and desktop participants in a political online survey that asked questions about the 2013 German federal election. To determine the reliability and validity of data submitted via mobile devices, we determined the consistency of the participants? responses across questions and validated the responses against various internal and external criteria. Replicating previous findings, mobile-device respondents were younger and more likely to be female, and they produced higher dropout rates and longer completion times than desktop respondents. However, data produced by respondents using mobile devices were as consistent, reliable, and valid as data produced by respondents using desktop computers. These findings contradict the notion that mobile-device users compromise the reliability and validity of data collected online and suggest that researchers do not necessarily need to be afraid of the participation of mobile-device respondents in web surveys.

AB  - Questionnaire responses were compared between high school students and teachers, all of whom participate in their school's 24/7 access tablet PC (TPC) program. Primary areas of interest were students' and teachers' experiences with and attitudes about the TPCs, physical discomfort associated with TPC use, and patterns of TPC use. Results showed students' and teachers' attitudes were generally quite positive towards the TPCs, including both groups appreciating the TPC as an organizational aid. However, neither group tended to think TPCs had improved student grades. It is important to explore the similarities and differences between people who share a classroom and much more as they proceed through a school year together. This type of assessment provides a useful complement to more common assessments of impact of digital technology on academic performance.

AB  - Phishing has become a serious cyber-security issue, and it is spreading through various media such as e-mail, SMS to capture the victim's critical profile information. Although many novel anti-phishing techniques have been developed to forestall the progress of phishing, it remains an unresolved issue. Smishing is an incarnation of Phishing attack, which utilizes Short Messaging Service (SMS) or simple text message on mobile phones to lure the victim's online credentials. This paper presents an anti-phishing model entitled 'SmiDCA' (SMIshing Detection based on Correlation Algorithm). The proposed model has collected different smishing messages from various sources, and 39 distinct features were extracted initially. The SmiDCA model incorporates dimensionality reduction, and machine Learning-based experiments were conducted on without (BFSA) and with (AFSA) reduction of features. The model has been validated with experiments on both the English and non-English datasets and the results of both of these experiments are encouraging in terms of accuracy: 96.40% for English dataset and 90.33% for the non-English dataset. In addition, the model achieved an accuracy of 96.16% even after nearly half of the features were pruned.

AB  - An online survey was conducted in Estonia among 223 judges, prosecutors, police officers and victim support officers; 223 victims were interviewed via phone and 26 legal professionals (including lawyers) were interviewed face to face with an aim to determine the level of protection of victims after implementation of the Directive 2012/29/EU. The results reveal that victims lack knowledge about their rights although law enforcement agencies are, in general, convinced that they do a good job in this respect. Victims desire criminal proceedings in which they are respected, their opinion is heard and matters, and they are kept informed about developments of the case. The reality, however, does not meet their expectations. As law enforcement agencies are focused on determining guilt of a defendant, victims? needs fall to the background. There seems to be a dichotomy between the expectations of law enforcement officials and those of the victims: While the latter awaits to be contacted and informed, the officials expect at least certain initiative from victims themselves. The idea that victims should be allowed to speak just to provide them with satisfaction and sense of fair proceedings is still somewhat strange for the authorities. When it comes to sentencing, some state officials believe that the opinions of a victim should not even be asked as determination of the punishment is court?s business. Victims? opinions are much more readily heard in the conciliation proceedings, which are based on the ideas of restorative justice, but in which defendants? needs seem to have been forgotten.

AB  - Background: Sugarcane cultivars are polyploid interspecific hybrids of giant genomes, typically with 10-13 sets of chromosomes from 2 Saccharum species. The ploidy, hybridity, and size of the genome, estimated to have >10 Gb, pose a challenge for sequencing. Results: Here we present a gene space assembly of SP80-3280, including 373,869 putative genes and their potential regulatory regions. The alignment of single-copy genes in diploid grasses to the putative genes indicates that we could resolve 2-6 (up to 15) putative homo(eo)logs that are 99.1% identical within their coding sequences. Dissimilarities increase in their regulatory regions, and gene promoter analysis shows differences in regulatory elements within gene families that are expressed in a species-specific manner. We exemplify these differences for sucrose synthase (SuSy) and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), 2 gene families central to carbon partitioning. SP80-3280 has particular regulatory elements involved in sucrose synthesis not found in the ancestor Saccharum spontaneum. PAL regulatory elements are found in co-expressed genes related to fiber synthesis within gene networks defined during plant growth and maturation. Comparison with sorghum reveals predominantly bi-allelic variations in sugarcane, consistent with the formation of 2 "subgenomes" after their divergence ∼3.8-4.6 million years ago and reveals single-nucleotide variants that may underlie their differences. Conclusions: This assembly represents a large step towards a whole-genome assembly of a commercial sugarcane cultivar. It includes a rich diversity of genes and homo(eo)logous resolution for a representative fraction of the gene space, relevant to improve biomass and food production.

AB  - Introduction: Altered emotion dynamics may represent a transdiagnostic risk factor for mood psychopathology. The present study examined whether altered emotion dynamics were associated with bipolar and depressive psychopathology concurrently and at a three-year follow-up. Methods: At baseline (n = 138), participants completed diagnostic interviews, questionnaires, and seven days of experience sampling assessments. Four emotion dynamics were computed for negative affect (NA) and positive affect (PA) – within-person variance (variability), mean square of successive differences and probability of acute change (instability), and autocorrelation (inertia). At the three-year follow-up, participants (n = 108) were re-assessed via interviews and questionnaires. Results: NA variability was associated with bipolar spectrum disorders at baseline and follow-up. NA instability predicted depressive symptoms and hypomanic personality at baseline, and bipolar spectrum disorders at the follow-up. NA inertia did not predict diagnoses or symptoms at either assessment. PA inertia predicted hyperthymic temperament at baseline but not follow-up. Notably, NA variability and instability predicted the development of new bipolar spectrum disorders at the follow-up. Limitations: Consistent with the recruitment strategy and young age of the participants, only 50% had developed diagnosable psychopathology by the time of the follow-up assessment. Conclusions: The present study provided a unique demonstration that altered emotion dynamics differentially predicted bipolar and depressive psychopathology concurrently and prospectively. Emotion dynamics are important to both digital phenotyping and mobile-based interventions as emotional instability offers a measurable risk factor that is identifiable prior to illness onset.

AB  - Under the rubric of transport much previous research on everyday mobility has focused on understanding the more representational and readily articulated aspects of everyday movement. By way of contrast, emergent theorisations of mobility suggest that an understanding of the less representational -- those fleeting, ephemeral and often embodied and sensory aspects of movement -- is vital if we are to fully understand why and how people move around. Accordingly, the ability of conventional methods to complement new research agendas, particularly those related to issues around the sensory, affect and embodied experience has been called in to question. This paper contributes to the burgeoning literature on mobile methodologies by critically discussing a theoretical and methodological journey towards mobile video ethnography in the context of a project researching cycling in London, UK between 2004 and 2006. In doing so it highlights three ways in which mobile video ethnography can contribute to research in the new mobilities paradigm: video as a way of 'feeling there' when you can't be there; video as a way of apprehending fleeting moments of mobile experience; and video as a tool to extend sensory vocabularies. It also critically discusses the limitations of video as a text and the importance of embodied experience, interpretation and audiencing to its success as part of a mobile methodology. Whilst emphasising the need for caution, the paper demonstrates the way in which mobile video ethnography can contribute to a new mobilities agenda by facilitating more situated understandings of daily corporeal mobility which highlight an alternative time-space politics to those inscribed in road spaces.

AB  - The rise of online competitors and increasingly well-informed customers have spurred stationary retailers to take measures to increase the quality of face-to-face selling as a key differentiator. Mobile sales assistants (MSAs) represent an intensively discussed technological approach to address these challenges in the salesperson–customer dyad. However, in many cases, salespeople do not or only sporadically use MSAs. Prior research provides inadequate answers as to why this is the case, as extant technology acceptance and resistance theories have limited applicability to MSAs. To address these research gaps, the authors conduct a qualitative, theory-building approach and identify 21 factors associated with resistance. In a subsequent quantitative survey study, they validate these factors and refine their conceptual structure. The results show that several largely unknown factors are associated with salespeople’s resistance to MSA use: The three higher-order constructs, ‘incongruence’, ‘relationship deterioration’, and ‘operational imperfection’, are newly introduced to the literature on technology resistance. The findings extend prior technology acceptance and resistance theories and provide comprehensive insights for retail managers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - As technology evolves and globalization continues, the need for reasonably priced roaming services has never been higher. In 2007, the European Commission (EC) introduced a first set of regulatory decisions to cap the maximal roaming fee end users have to pay for voice services. In the years after, additional price caps have been introduced for SMS and data, initially only for end users, in a later stage also for the wholesale tariff. The final step, Roaming Like at Home (RLAH), will start to take effect in June 2017; from then on end users will pay the same price (for voice, SMS and data) when roaming like in their domestic country.
The effect of RLAH on the business case of each mobile operator is hard to predict, as the different national markets are extremely heterogeneous and operators face large discrepancies in terms of roaming usage and network costs due to different travelling patterns and various other reasons that cannot be harmonized (geography, economics, working force, usage history, etc.). Furthermore, competition in the telecom market will no longer be a purely national matter, as the decision to abolish roaming tariffs will fully open up cross-border competition.
This paper aims at providing insights in the effect of RLAH for both the end user as well as the mobile operators. Following a literature survey approach, including an overview of the roaming regulation process from 2007 up to now, the paper discusses possible effects the RLAH initiative might trigger, going from lower wholesale prices for mobile operators to higher retail prices for end Users. Additionally, as the European Commission strives for a digital single market, this paper presents a number of technical solutions (carrier portability, software-based SIMs, cross-border IMSI, Roaming like a Local, Wi-Fi offloading) that may pose a - partial or full - alternative for roaming and explains how these may impact cross-border competition both positively and negatively. The solutions are assessed against two axes: (1) generating the best possible outcome for the end customers (in all countries) and (2) ensuring the best level playing field for (virtual) mobile operators in Europe, which will of course involve trade-offs on different levels.

AB  - Search firms provide matchmaking services between consumers and suppliers that are central to the efficiency of the economy. The significant economic contributions of search firms as commercial intermediaries have important implications for antitrust policy towards search markets. As search firms generate more information about buyers and sellers, they become intermediaries for an increasing proportion of economic transactions. This article introduces the concept of the "map of commerce" to describe the extensive directory of business constructed by search firms. This article also introduces the concept of the "circular flow of information" to represent the comprehensive nature of the economic information managed by search firms. These firms induce information revelation through self-selection both by consumers and by advertisers. Consumers reveal personal information through the use of keywords and through their online behavior. Advertisers reveal company information by bidding on positions on the search page. Search firms employ information to match buyers with sellers more effectively and to increase earnings from advertising. The analysis shows that economic efficiencies generated by the circular flow of information depend on the strength of competition among search firms. The discussion considers antitrust policy towards Internet search markets, including issues of privacy, competition, and cooperative agreements. © The Author (2009).

AB  - The increasing availability of high‐dimensional, fine‐grained data about human behaviour, gathered from mobile sensing studies and in the form of digital footprints, is poised to drastically alter the way personality psychologists perform research and undertake personality assessment. These new kinds and quantities of data raise important questions about how to analyse the data and interpret the results appropriately. Machine learning models are well suited to these kinds of data, allowing researchers to model highly complex relationships and to evaluate the generalizability and robustness of their results using resampling methods. The correct usage of machine learning models requires specialized methodological training that considers issues specific to this type of modelling. Here, we first provide a brief overview of past studies using machine learning in personality psychology. Second, we illustrate the main challenges that researchers face when building, interpreting, and validating machine learning models. Third, we discuss the evaluation of personality scales, derived using machine learning methods. Fourth, we highlight some key issues that arise from the use of latent variables in the modelling process. We conclude with an outlook on the future role of machine learning models in personality research and assessment.

AB  - This dissertation examines how the management and configuration of organizational IT portfolios enhance organizations and their employees. Specifically, the theory of the differentiation and integration of information technologies is developed with in-depth examinations of 'Bring-Your-Own-Device' (BYOD) policies. Four data collections are utilized: survey vignettes, case studies, agent-based simulations, and a questionnaire survey. Each essay uses a mixed-method approach providing insights into the selection, development, and management of ITs across individual and organizational levels. Essay 1 explores the impact of BYOD on employees' performance, job satisfaction, and work-life conflicts. The results indicate that IT integration improves performance and job satisfaction, and reduces work-life conflicts. Alternatively, IT differentiation increases work-life conflicts while having no direct impact on performance or job satisfaction. However, the impact of IT differentiation is enhanced when increased IT integration is present in the organization's IT portfolio which in combination provides variety for individuals while ensuring reduced compatibility issues across employee tasks. Essay 2 examines how organizations can configure their IT portfolios over time to meet the demands of varying task portfolios. The results provide insights into optimal levels of IT differentiation and IT integration for varying environments. Increased IT differentiation allows employees to utilize more efficient and effective technologies to meet their specific tasks. However, an increased level of IT integration is needed to meet the additional compatibility concerns arising from this IT differentiation. Essay 3 examines how individual decision-making behaviors and organizational IT policies impact the configuration of IT differentiation and IT integration. A combination of online survey vignettes, agent-based simulations, and a questionnaire survey provides insights into how individuals and organizations can impact the IT portfolio over time. The results indicate that the claimed benefits of BYOD may not materialize unless the employees are choosing their provided technologies based on rational decisions. This dissertation finds that BYOD polices may increase productivity and satisfaction for employees and organizations. However, organizations must ensure they examine their task portfolio, employee technology needs and knowledge, and IT policy attributes to ensure BYOD is the right solution. The results provide organizations increased knowledge to ensure increased performance from their IT decisions. Copies of dissertations may be obtained by addressing your request to ProQuest, 789 E.

AB  - In recent years, agricultural extension services in developing countries have increasingly introduced modern information and communication technologies (ICT) to deliver advice. But to realize efficiency gains, digital applications may need to address heterogeneous information needs by targeting agricultural advisory contents in a household-specific way. We explore the feasibility of an automated advisory service that collects household data from farmers, for example through the keypads of conventional mobile phones, and uses this data to prioritize agricultural advisory messages accordingly. To reduce attrition, such a system must avoid lengthy inquiry. Therefore, our objective was to identify a viable trade-off between low data requirements and useful household-specific prioritizations of advisory messages. At three sites in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania independently, we collected experimental preference rankings from smallholder farmers for receiving information about different agricultural and livelihood practices. At each site, we identified socio-economic household variables that improved model-based predictions of individual farmers' information preferences. We used the models to predict household-specific rankings of information options based on 2-4 variables, requiring the farmer to answer between 5 and 10 questions through an ICT interface. These predicted rankings could inform household-specific prioritizations of advisory messages in a digital agro-advisory application. Household-specific "top 3" options suggested by the models were better-fit to farmers' preferences than a random selection of 3 options by 48-68%, on average. The analysis shows that relatively limited data inputs from fanners, in a simple format, can be used to increase the client-orientation of ICT-mediated agricultural extension. This suggests that household-specific prioritization of agricultural advisory messages through digital two-way communication is feasible. In future digital agricultural advisory applications, collecting little data from farmers at each interaction may feed into learning algorithms that continuously improve the targeting of advice.

AB  - The 2019 Canadian Election Study (CES) consists of two separate surveys with campaign-period rolling cross-sections and post-election follow-ups. The parallel studies were conducted online and through a random-digit-dial (RDD) telephone survey. Both continue the long tradition of gathering information about the attitudes, opinions, preferences and behaviours of the Canadian public. The online survey, in particular, introduces some important innovations that open up the potential for exciting new research on subgroups in the electorate.

AB  - Background:With the pharmaceutical industry?s increased attention on enhancing patient experiences during their participation in clinical trials, the use of mobile nurse (MN) services to support the conduct of clinical trial assessments in the home (or in alternative locations other than in investigational sites) has been gaining momentum.Methods:Because no quantitative data capturing industry-wide practices are available, in July 2014, Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development and Hoffman-La Roche conducted an online survey to gather data on the prevalence and utilization of MN services in clinical trials taking into account the following factors: industry perceptions of the business model, risks barriers to adoption, vendor landscape, cost, and prospects for future growth. A total of 113 respondents answered the survey, with 53 respondents answering all questions.Results:The use of MN services in clinical trials is an established and growing business practice. Utilization of MN services has so far been most prevalent in North America, followed by Western Europe. Sponsor companies that have adopted this model have done so mainly to improve patient retention and protocol compliance, as well as improve access to rare patients. Most of the companies surveyed work directly with vendors specializing in home nurse services. Experience with vendors was considered favorable in most cases.Conclusions:Building effective partnerships with 1 to 2 vendors is considered a key factor for long-term success.

AB  - Question grids are common on Web surveys, and studies show that grids can affect how respondents complete surveys. However, there is little research that investigates the effects of grids on Web surveys completed on mobile devices. In this article, we evaluate the effects of question grids on response quality and measurement error for surveys taken on phones or tablets. Our study draws on a probabilistic Web survey. The survey included an experiment in which respondents were assigned to one of three question format conditions: one large grid, two small grids, or single item per page. We analyze how question grids affect response times and nondifferentiation as well as explore the interaction effects between grids and devices. Reductions in time associated with question grids were greater for surveys completed on mobile devices as opposed to those completed on computers. Likewise, the increases in nondifferentiation associated with question grids were greater for surveys completed on mobile devices. We find that effects of question grids on responses in Web surveys can differ across devices, and so researchers should be cautious of using grids on Web surveys as more people opt to do surveys on phones or tablets.

AB  - Due to 'stay-at-home' measures, individuals increasingly relied on smartphones for social connection and for obtaining information about the COVID-19 pandemic. In a two-wave panel survey (N-Time2 = 416), we investigated associations between different types of smartphone use (i.e., communicative and non-communicative), friendship satisfaction, and anxiety during the first lockdown in Austria. Our findings revealed that communicative smartphone use increased friendship satisfaction over time, validating how smartphones can be a positive influence in difficult times. Friendship satisfaction decreased anxiety after one month, signaling the importance of strong friendship networks during the crisis. Contrary to our expectations, non-communicative smartphone use had no effects on friendship satisfaction or anxiety over time. Reciprocal effects showed that anxiety increased both types of smartphone use over time. These findings are discussed in the context of mobile media effects related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - In an era of digitally connected students, there is a demand for academic material to be delivered through electronic mobile devices and not just through traditional methods such as lectures and tutorials. A digital interactive book—iBook (for use on the Apple iPad)—was created to teach undergraduate anatomical science students (n = 26) four key areas of the brachial plexus: definitions, gross anatomy, relative anatomy, and functions of terminal branches. Students were asked to complete preresource and postresource questionnaires, which were used to calculate the mean improvement score and ultimately the efficacy of the resource. Free text comments were gathered to evaluate student opinions on this mode of learning. The mean score on the preresource and postresource questionnaires was 4.07 of 8 and 5.69 of 8, respectively. The overall mean improvement score was 1.62, determined statistically significant by a dependent t‐test (P = 0.0004). Findings demonstrate that digital books on the iPad provide a uniquely interactive way of delivering information and engaging students. Furthermore, digital books can be used alongside traditional methods of teaching anatomy to enhance and promote deep learning in students. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Genomic approaches are revolutionizing the biomedical sciences, providing new ways in which to approach the development of therapeutic practices and the understanding of the causal bases of disease. So, too, do genomics approaches have the potential to transform the way in which ecological studies can be conducted by providing powerful tools in which genotype and phenotype data of diverse "wild" populations can be measured with a never-before-possible level of fine-scale resolution. In this article, we examine the potential for genomics-enabled approaches to aid in understanding the responses of populations to climate change and highlight examples in which these tools have been applied to understand physiological adaptation or migration.

AB  - In this article, we present an analysis of closings in two counseling media: online, text-based exchanges (usually referred to as "chat" sessions) and telephone calls. Previous research has found that the participant who initiated a conversation preferably also initiates its termination with a possible preclosing. Advice acknowledgments, lying in the epistemic domain of the client, are devices that may work as preclosings. However, in text-based chat clients regularly refrain from advice acknowledgment. While counselors use various practices to elicit advice acknowledgment in the context of potential advice resistance, hoaxing, and/or seemingly long pauses, these questions do not always succeed as "closing devices." This offers an explanation for counselors' perception of online chatting as more difficult than calling.

AB  - This article introduces a transliteracies framework to conceptually account for the contingency and instability of literacy practices on the move and to offer a set of methodological tools for investigating these mobilities. Taking the paradox of mobility-the simultaneous restricting or regulation of movement that accompanies mobility-as its central dialectic, a transliteracies framework functions as a flexible heuristic for attending to how meaning making and power are intertwined in and distributed across social and material relationships. We argue that a transliteracies framework encompasses two primary dimensions of mobile literacy practices: (a) the everyday activity of creating, maintaining, and disassembling associations across movements of people and things (indicated by the prefix trans-) and (b) the dynamic and material nature of meaning making in activity (indicated by the plural root word literacies). To trace the emergent and consequential ways mobilities are managed within and across systems, we introduce four analytical tools for inquiry: emergence, uptake, resonance, and scale. These inquiry tools address the paradox of mobility by highlighting the systemic dimensions of practice that create and perpetuate inequities. We argue that these transliteracies tools facilitate an inquiry stance that positions researchers to attend to people's emic meaning- making processes, work to balance multiple perspectives, account for privilege and position, question normative assumptions and beliefs, and engage in and value multiple ways of knowing.

AB  - This paper describes the contemporary use of information technology devices by children in a socio-educationally advantaged school. A sample of 924 children (50% girls) from grades 5 to 12 (ages 10–19 years) completed an online survey in class. Total daily technology use was high and similar for girls (mean 219 (SD 148) mins/day) and boys (207 (142), p = .186). Tablet computer was the dominant device used in grades 5–9, with laptop computer the dominant device in grades 10–12. Patterns of exposure were influenced by gender, device, grade and purpose of use interactions. For example, girls used mobile phones more than boys for social purposes for grades 10 and 11, but not grade 12. Whilst children’s attitudes to technology use were positive, musculoskeletal and visual symptoms were commonly reported. Hours/day tablet and phone use was related to neck/shoulder discomfort (OR = 1.07; 1.13) and visual symptoms (OR = 1.10; 1.07). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The growing smartphone penetration and the integration of smartphones into people's everyday practices offer researchers opportunities to augment survey measurement with smartphone-sensor measurement or to replace self-reports. Potential benefits include lower measurement error, a widening of research questions, collection of in situ data, and a lowered respondent burden. However, privacy considerations and other concerns may lead to nonparticipation. To date, little is known about the mechanisms of willingness to share sensor data by the general population, and no evidence is available concerning the stability of willingness. The present study focuses on survey respondents' willingness to share data collected using smartphone sensors (GPS, camera, and wearables) in a probability-based online panel of the general population of the Netherlands. A randomized experiment varied study sponsor, framing of the request, the emphasis on control over the data collection process, and assurance of privacy and confidentiality. Respondents were asked repeatedly about their willingness to share the data collected using smartphone sensors, with varying periods before the second request. Willingness to participate in sensor-based data collection varied by the type of sensor, study sponsor, order of the request, respondent's familiarity with the device, previous experience with participating in research involving smartphone sensors, and privacy concerns. Willingness increased when respondents were asked repeatedly and varied by sensor and task. The timing of the repeated request, one month or six months after the initial request, did not have a significant effect on willingness.

AB  - Today, the learning model of a single instructor interacting with many students that is applied in conventional classrooms forms a passive bottleneck. Moreover, the instructor cannot effectively record students’ individual learning histories for instantaneous and suitable feedback. To address these issues using a mobile learning system (MLS) the authors have applied the principles of human-computer interaction (HCI) to construct a usable MLS on a personal digital assistant (PDA) The research focuses on adaptive content delivery within the context of small-screen design. The authors utilized task analysis, a literature review, experimental design and approaches to small-screen design, and addressed potential issues with presentation in order to design a friendly PDA interface whose performance was analyzed with a post-experiment user satisfaction questionnaire. The results of this experiment show that the mobile-based classroom learning experience provides appropriate mobile tools to help students to become capable, self-reliant, self-motivated, and independent. The findings also demonstrate that variations among students’ preference for content are associated with differences in the display presentation mode, and that the landscape interface is recommended for use in some contexts.

AB  - The following questions are addressed in this chapter: How can leaders ensure they are proficient users and consumers of technology and supporters of a school vision that places technology as an essential part of the curriculum? What are the characteristics schools and universities need to educate a workforce that is capable of engaging in active learning and lifelong learning, higher cognitive skills, and collaboration and of using effective coping skills? What are the effective and efficient uses of technology for teaching and learning that enable faculty to feel comfortable using the technology to teach? How can leaders understand that different cultures use and perceive technology in different ways? What are the skills leaders need to help educators see assistive technology as a potential tool the student can use to improve his or her functioning or minimize the effects of his or her disability? How can leaders use the various models to help educational teams select the appropriate technology and understand that assistive technology is a highly integrated system, not just a device? The following topics are discussed: 21st-century skills, the digital divide, the school administrator of today, professional development in schools, technology for management, and technologies for a diverse student population.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the determinants that influence students' decision-making and satisfaction in campus e-voting, and to investigate the moderating effect on students' decision-making and satisfaction in campus e-voting between students with different levels of trust in the system.
Design/methodology/approach - This study employed a quantitative method and applied the use of self-administered questionnaires among university students who have at least experienced once in casting votes electronically in the past year during the campus e-voting period. The data were analysed using partial least square-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) approach.
Findings - The PLS-SEM approach revealed that voters' commitment to vote was the strongest determinant of students' decision-making and satisfaction in campus e-voting. Voters' high satisfaction with campus e-voting was based on the commitment and requirement of students of the university to vote. Compulsory voting was not a hassle for them in order to achieve campus development and sustainability. A moderation analysis revealed that the relative influence of commitment to vote on students' satisfaction in campus e-voting was higher in the group with medium level of trust than among the group with high level of trust.
Practical implications - The election commission of the university and the university management should increase students' turnout and commitment to vote during campus e-voting by outlining effective marketing strategies, campaigns and promotions across a number of digital platforms, including mobile SNS. They need to ensure that voters can sense their involvement is warranted and will continue to vote electronically in the next campus election.
Originality/value - The research yielded an exclusive perspective into students' decision-making and satisfaction in campus e-voting. It also uncovered the influence of moderating effect of trust in the system in developing countries which is marginally concealed in the literature. The measurements produced can be used as a research tool for more exploratory and explanatory research related to political marketing among young adult voters.

AB  - Mobile phone use while driving (MWD) is a threat to road safety, particularly for younger drivers. Research suggests impulsivity may be a psychological risk factor for MWD, however, the literature is limited. The current study examined the unique contributions of impulsivity facets on different social interactive MWD behaviours, and whether these relationships were influenced by mobile phone involvement. Eight hundred and fifty-three young drivers aged 17-25 years (M (age) = 19.89; 74 % female) completed an online questionnaire which included measures of the five-facet model of impulsivity, mobile phone involvement, and MWD (initiating, monitoring/reading, and responding to social communications). Of impulsivity facets, lower premeditation and higher positive urgency significantly predicted each MWD behaviour, while higher sensation seeking significantly predicted responding only, providing some support for differential relationships of impulsivity facets with MWD. Mobile phone involvement was a more robust predictor of MWD. Moreover, there were significant indirect effects of positive and negative urgency via mobile phone involvement for all three MWD behaviours. Findings highlight the importance of mobile phone involvement for explaining MWD which should be addressed in future studies.

AB  - In today?s world of networked, mobile, and global digital communication, Muslim martyrdom as a multi-layered communicative practice has experienced a new type of media saturation, thereby posing a challenge for the study of media, religion, and culture in a digital age. In this article, the analysis focuses on two cases of high symbolic relevance for the events later referred to as the ?Arab Spring??the deaths of a Tunisian fruit seller Mohammed Bouazizi and a young Egyptian man Khaled Saeed. Special focus is given to the discussion of digital solidarities and their construction in circulation and remediation of martyr narratives of Bouazizi and Saeed in diverse media contexts. In this global development of digital solidarities, we identify two categories of martyr images of particular relevance?a ?living martyr? and a ?tortured martyr??and discuss their resonance with different historical, religious, cultural, and political frames of interpretation. In conclusion, we reflect on the question of the ethics of global mediation of Muslim martyrdom and its implications for the study field of media, religion, and culture in its digital state.

AB  - This study investigates the standardization-adaptation paradox during the web-mobile service transition. Specifically, according to the expectation confirmation theory and the desire confirmation theory, the study proposes that user perceptions of the adaptability to the mobile context and of the consistency between the web and mobile services can shape their satisfaction with mobile services. This, in turn, can affect the intention to adopt mobile services. Furthermore, the study also highlights that males and females prefer different strategies (standardization or adaptation), such that perceived adaptability has a stronger impact on satisfaction for males than for females, while perceived consistency has a stronger impact on satisfaction for females than for males. A structural equation modeling analysis was conducted on data collected in China from a survey with 235 responses, and the results confirmed all of the hypotheses of the proposed research model. Theoretical and practical implications are also discussed.

AB  - What makes customization so appealing? Is it because the content is tailored or because the user feels greater agency? Study 1 tested these propositions with a news-aggregator Website that was either personalized (system-tailored), customized (user-tailored), or neither. Power users rated content quality higher when it had a customizable interface, whereas nonpower users preferred personalized content. In Study 2, half the participants were told that their browsing information may be used for providing requested services while the other half was told that it would not be used. The interaction found in Study 1 was observed only under conditions of low privacy, with the pattern being reversed under high privacy. Significant three-way interactions were found for sense of control and perceived convenience. © 2010 International Communication Association.

AB  - Digital media (DM), such as cellphones and tablets, are a common part of our daily lives and their usage has changed the communication structure within families. Thus, there is a risk that the use of DM might result in fewer opportunities for interactions between children and their parents leading to fewer language learning moments for young children. The current study examined the associations between children's language development and early DM exposure.
Participants: Ninety-two parents of 25months olds (50 boys/42 girls) recorded their home sound environment during a typical day [Language ENvironment Analysis (LENA)] and participated in an online questionnaire consisting of questions pertaining to daily DM use and media mediation strategies, as well as a Swedish online version of the MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory, which includes a vocabulary scale as well as a grammar and pragmatics scale.
Results: Through correlations and stepwise regressions three aspects of language were analyzed. The child's vocabulary was positively associated with interactional turn-taking. The child's vocabulary and grammar were negatively associated with the likelihood of parent's device use during everyday child routines and the amount of TV watched by the child. The child's pragmatic development was also positively associated with the parent's device use in child routines but also with the parent's joint media engagement (JME), as well as the child's gender (where girls perform better).
Conclusion: Our study confirms that specific aspects of the 2-year old's DM environment are associated with the child's language development. More TV content, whether it is viewed on a big screen or tablet, is negatively associated with language development. The likelihood of parents' use of DM during everyday child routines is also negatively associated with the child's language development. Positive linguistic parental strategies such as interactional turn-taking with the child, JME, and book reading, on the other hand, are positively associated with the child's language development.

AB  - Digital media (DM) is omnipresent in society today and impacts every aspect of our life. Previous studies have shown DM to cause problems in interpersonal relationships by creating problematic interruptions in interactions, this has been termed technoference. The current study focuses on parent's self-rated perceived technoference and the rated behavior of their 4- to 5-year-old children. Parents (N = 153) filled out an online questionnaire regarding family DM use and technoference as well as questions regarding their child's behavior. Parents rated the level of technoference caused by their own use of DM as well as the rate of technoference caused by the child's use of DM. Parents were also asked questions regarding their own possible problematic cell phone use. The findings reveal a statistically significant contribution of technoference, caused by the parents' use of DM, to the behavior repertoire of the children.

AB  - Mobile health (mHealth) customers shopping for applications (apps) should be aware of app privacy practices so they can make informed decisions about purchase and use. We sought to assess the availability, scope, and transparency of mHealth app privacy policies on iOS and Android. Over 35 000 mHealth apps are available for iOS and Android. Of the 600 most commonly used apps, only 183 (30.5%) had privacy policies. Average policy length was 1755 (SD 1301) words with a reading grade level of 16 (SD 2.9). Two thirds (66.1%) of privacy policies did not specifically address the app itself. Our findings show that currently mHealth developers often fail to provide app privacy policies. The privacy policies that are available do not make information privacy practices transparent to users, require college-level literacy, and are often not focused on the app itself. Further research is warranted to address why privacy policies are often absent, opaque, or irrelevant, and to find a remedy.

AB  - Developing country lenders are taking advantage of fintech tools to create fully digital loans on mobile phones. Using administrative and survey data, we study the take up and impacts of one of the most popular digital loan products in the world, M-Shwari in Kenya. While 34% of those eligible for a loan take it, the loan does not substitute for other credit. The loans improve household resilience: households are 6.3 percentage points less likely to forego expenses due to negative shocks. Fintech tools can be a crucial way to improve financial access and household resilience.

AB  - Objective: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its risk factors disproportionately affect people returning from incarceration. These individuals face multiple barriers to obtaining care, which can impact CVD and risk factor management and may be mitigated through use of a smartphone application (app). Therefore, we explored the CVD-related needs of people released from incarceration and which app features would support these needs. Materials and Methods: In 2019, we collected qualitative data through 7 focus groups with 76 returning citizens and 19 key informants through interviews and small group discussions in Baltimore, Maryland. Verbal data were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using inductive thematic coding with N-Vivo qualitative software. Results: Returning citizens face multiple barriers when trying to engage in care and services related to cardiovascular health, including around medications and health insurance. Some major challenges were identifying trusted social services and making cardiovascular health a priority. Findings suggested that CVD risk factors could be more effectively addressed in combination with attending to other pressing needs related to employment, housing, behavioral health, and building trust. Participants suggested that a smartphone app would be most useful if it broadly addressed these issues by linking returning citizens to social services, including recommendations from peers, and facilitating access to healthcare. Discussion: Returning citizens need broad support for societal reintegration. Addressing social issues would allow them to focus on cardiovascular health. Conclusion: Given the challenges experienced after release from incarceration, an app focused on social and health-access issues may help returning citizens meet their CVD needs.

AB  - A framework for constructing a cognitive model of users' information searching behaviour is described. The motivation for the framework is to create explanatory and predictive theories of information searching to improve the design of information retrieval (IR) systems. The framework proposes a taxonomy of components for process models of the information seeking task, information need types and knowledge sources necessary to support the task. The framework is developed into a preliminary version of a cognitive theory of information searching by the addition of strategies and correspondence rules which predict user behaviour in different task stages according to information need types, facilities provided by the IR system and knowledge held by the user. The theory is evaluated by using claims analysis based on empirical observations of users information retrieval and by a walkthrough of an IR session to investigate how well the theory can account for empirical evidence. Results show that the theory can indicate the expert strategies which should be followed in different task contexts but predictions of actual user behaviour are less accurate. The future possibilities for employing the theoretical model as a tutorial advisor for information retrieval and as an evaluation method for IR systems are reviewed. The role and potential of cognitive theories of user task-action in Information Retrieval and Human Computer Interaction are discussed. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The purpose of the study described in this chapter was to survey Gen Y job seekers in order to gain a clearer understanding of the expectations of the recruitment process. Specifically, this study focused on the pre employment phase that is likely to begin during on-campus interviews, at a career fair, or over the phone. The aim of this study was to inform organizations that seek to attract Gen Y workers about what is important during the pre employment phase. Based on this notion, the following four conclusions were drawn as evidenced by the empirical and qualitative results and implications discussed previously. In order to maintain high procedural justice perceptions, organizations must treat candidates fairly by informing them about how information is gathered during the pre employment phase. As an example, many of the Gen Y candidates desire to know more about how information is gathered: will the organization conduct a web search, will they conduct a search on Facebook, will they call personal and professional references, and the like.

AB  - In an earlier paper we described a structured, theory-driven training programme which was administered to 10 individuals with moderate-to-severe memory impairment. All individuals received an errorless-fading-of-cues protocol in the use of personal digital assistants (PDAs) or smartphones (Svoboda, Richards, Leach, & Mertens, 2012) and demonstrated generalisation of acquired skills to day-to-day memory challenges. Maintenance of intervention gains over the long-term is another indicator of successful generalisation. Here we present the maintenance of device use in the same group of individuals 12 to 19 months after programme completion. A within-subject, ABABB multi-case experimental design was used to evaluate the impact of PDA or smartphone use on day-to-day memory functioning at baseline, immediately post-intervention, at return to baseline, and at short-term and long-term follow-up. Results presented here focus predominantly on long-term follow-up. All 10 individuals showed maintenance of gains in day-to-day functioning as quantified across several ecologically valid questionnaire and task-based measures. This was corroborated by family members with whom six of the participants resided. This study further demonstrates the programme's clinical effectiveness in enabling individuals with moderate-to-severe memory impairment to function more independently and with greater confidence up to 19 months following programme completion.

AB  - A concurrent mixed methods design was used to explore personal and workplace factors, informed by the Theory of Planned Behavior, that affect truck drivers’ decision-making about distracted driving on the job. Qualitative data were collected via semi-structured interviews with experts in truck safety and distracted driving, and quantitative data were collected via online survey of truck drivers in the United States. Findings from the interviews illustrated how drivers perceived distractions and the importance of supervisors enforcing organizational distracted driving policies. Survey results found that behavioral intentions were most important in regards to texting and crash and near-crash outcomes, while perceived norms from management best described the correlation between dispatch device use and negative crash-related outcomes. By using a mixed methods design, rather than two separate studies, these findings revealed nuanced differences into the influence of supervisors on distracted driving.

AB  - We focus on "curated news:" a collection of links delivered to one's inbox, phone, or RSS feed. These digests vary in the extent to which they contextualize the information they present. Some offer headlines with links to the full article, while others summarize and interpret the story for the reader. Using a survey experiment, we vary the amount of contextualization present in a set of curated links. We find that increased curation decreases the likelihood that individuals will seek out the original source of political information, but it does lead people to recall more information about the issues being discussed.

AB  - This longitudinal study explores the effects of tracking and monitoring time devoted to learn with a mobile tool, on self-regulated learning. Graduate students (n = 36) from three different online courses used their own mobile devices to track how much time they devoted to learn over a period of four months. Repeated measures of the Online Self-Regulated Learning Questionnaire and Validity and Reliability of Time Management Questionnaire were taken along the course. Our findings reveal positive effects of tracking time on time management skills. Variations in the channel, content and timing of the mobile notifications to foster reflective practice are investigated, and time-logging patterns are described. These results not only provide evidence of the benefits of recording learning time, but also suggest relevant cues on how mobile notifications should be designed and prompted towards self-regulated learning of students in online courses.

AB  - Introduction: Youth nicotine dependence may vary by e-cigarette device used. Methods: E-cigarette device type ("JUUL," "similar pod/JUUL like device (i.e., pod mod)," or "other type of ecigarette" (i.e., tank, mod)), nicotine dependence (Hooked on Nicotine Checklist; HONC), frequency of e-cigarette use (i.e., weekly, daily, monthly), and covariates were examined via a convenience sample of youth who use e-cigarettes in the United States via an online Qualtrics panel survey from April 2019 to May 2019. Results: Youth aged 13-17 (Mean age = 15.9 years, SD = 1.0 year; n = 185) were mostly 72.4% female. Primary device used by category was endorsed as follows: JUUL n = 87, pod mod n = 42, and other type of e-cigarette n = 56. Participants endorsed an average of 4.5 / 10 HONC symptoms (SD = 3.6). Compared to other e-cigarettes, youth who used JUUL and pod mod devices endorsed more dependence symptoms, even when adjusting for current smoking status (JUUL IRR = 1.96, 95% CI 1.30-2.97; pod mod device IRR = 1.76, 95% CI 1.08-2.87). In total, HONC symptoms significantly differed by device for 8/10 symptoms, with JUUL and pod mod users reporting higher frequency of items compared to other e-cigarette devices. Conclusions: Features of nicotine dependence experienced by youth (i.e., feeling a stronger urge to vape) differed by primary device used, with those using JUUL and pod-mods reporting a greater level of dependence. Regulation of features of e-cigarette devices that may increase nicotine delivery and subsequent development of dependence among youth warrant urgent consideration.

AB  - Purpose:Older adults generally have an increased need for health care information. Whereas some use the Internet to look for this information, others use more traditional sources. This study gathered data from older adults to determine their health information needs, the perceived usefulness of sources of health information, and if there are differences in perceptions and use of health information between Internet users and nonusers.Design and Methods:We conducted 9 focus groups - 4 groups of Internet users (n = 27) and 5 groups of non-Internet users (n = 26) - to determine reasons for seeking health information, satisfaction with information, and use of the Internet to fulfill information needs. Data from focus groups were supplemented with questionnaire data.Results:Those who do not use the Internet were found to be just as satisfied with the health information they find as those who search for information online. We also found that nonusers are more likely to make health care decisions based upon information found offline than Internet users who have access to more information.Implications:Nonusers may find it quicker to look for information through traditional media sources and stay offline, thus limiting their information options. Strategies for encouraging Internet use and programs to teach effective searching skills are needed. Physicians could also direct older patients toward credible health information Web sites.

AB  - This article investigates the daily travelling practices that are related to mobile-only, fixed-only and combined mobile/fixed use of the Internet, and the social differentiations that are related to these three ways of accessing the Internet. Survey data (N = 612) collected from Finland in 2011 are analysed. The article shows that mobile-only Internet use is not associated with particularly diverse or frequent daily travelling practices, whereas combined mobile/fixed use is. Mobile-only Internet users are, in fact, in a relatively disadvantaged position - compared with other users, they are more typically unemployed and their household income is lower. The mobility of Internet access as such does not guarantee a safe social position in society. Mobile Internet use must be complemented with fixed use, which brings about more versatile and frequent travelling. The finding suggests that the mobile-rich get richer' when it comes to Internet use and daily travelling practices.

AB  - Post-discharge phone calls are a widely used yet suboptimal method of ascertaining recovery of day surgery patients. We compared the efficiency of an automated electronic system of follow-up, the Day Care Anaesthesia Outcomes Recording Registry (DayCOR), and a telephone call system that was standard practice in our non-profit private healthcare organisation in Victoria, Australia. We also surveyed a group of clinicians to assess their acceptance of DayCOR compared with the telephone call system. DayCOR is a web-based system which collects, alerts, manages and analyses patient-reported outcomes. Patients may opt in to respond to a 15-question survey via a link sent by text message or email. DayCOR?s patient response rate was 77.5%, compared with 66.0% for the telephone call system. Both systems collected data on clinical, process, and experience outcomes. Completeness of data collection was 100% using DayCOR compared with 51%?61.4% of data items using the telephone call system. We estimated that replacing our telephone call system with DayCOR to follow up 60,000 day surgery patients a year would represent an annual cost reduction of AUD$101,345 (53%) using manual demographic data entry, and AUD$142,745 (74%) if DayCOR was integrated with the institution?s existing administrative software. Seventy-eight percent of day surgery nurses and 94% of anaesthetists preferred DayCOR to the telephone call system. All anaesthetists surveyed stated that DayCOR provided more valuable feedback, and almost one-fifth had changed their clinical practice as a result. DayCOR?s efficiency and acceptability will allow more effective collection of post-discharge patient outcomes than is currently possible in our institution, and will support interventional studies aimed at improving quality of recovery of day surgery patients.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the level of privacy concern among users of mobile social networking (MSN) apps, and the effect of users' privacy concern on their acceptance of MSN apps. Based on the social exchange theory as well as the uses and gratification theory, we developed a research model to hypothesise the relationships among privacy-related constructs. We tested the research model using the data collected from a survey study. Our data analysis indicates that survey respondents have privacy concern when using MSN apps. However, the direct effect of privacy concern on user's behavioural intention is not statistically significant, while enjoyment has a significant positive influence on the behavioural intention. The antecedents of enjoyment and privacy concern are found to significantly affect their respective dependent variable. The findings help researchers and practitioners better understand the impact of privacy concern on users' acceptance of MSN apps.

AB  - Mobile technologies have substantially changed how people consume media content, in particular during big events. This study examined audience's mobile experience with the 'first mobile Olympics' and found that motivations, preference, perceived usefulness, access to media technologies, and media use routine significantly predicted mobile use for big-event content. Additionally, fmdings suggest that compared to nonusers, mobile Olympics users were more intensely engaged and involved in sports and the Olympics overall, enjoyed a broader range of Olympics sports, and were more accustomed to using online and mobile sources to view media content. Television was still the dominant platform for big-event viewing, however, mobile consumption increased dramatically during the London Olympics, and indicated a need for more personalised, multifaceted programming with mobility and immediacy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We conduct a first large-scale analysis of mobile health (mHealth) apps available on Google Play with the goal of providing a comprehensive view of mHealth apps' security features and gauging the associated risks for mHealth users and their data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We designed an app collection platform that discovered and downloaded more than 20 000 mHealth apps from the Medical and Health & Fitness categories on Google Play. We performed a suite of app code and traffic measurements to highlight a range of app security flaws: certificate security, sensitive or unnecessary permission requests, malware presence, communication security, and security-related concerns raised in user reviews. RESULTS: Compared to baseline non-mHealth apps, mHealth apps generally adopt more reliable signing mechanisms and request fewer dangerous permissions. However, significant fractions of mHealth apps expose users to serious security risks. Specifically, 1.8% of mHealth apps package suspicious codes (eg, trojans), 45.0% rely on unencrypted communication, and as much as 23.0% of personal data (eg, location information and passwords) is sent on unsecured traffic. An analysis of the app reviews reveals that mHealth app users are largely unaware of the surfaced security issues. CONCLUSION: Despite being better aligned with security best practices than non-mHealth apps, mHealth apps are still far from ensuring robust security guarantees. App users, clinicians, technology developers, and policy makers alike should be cognizant of the uncovered security issues and weigh them carefully against the benefits of mHealth apps.

AB  - Over time, publishing technologies have not only influenced how people read, but also how knowledge is evaluated and authority is established. Social and mobile technologies represent relatively recent developments that have transformed the trade publishing world, but the extent to which they have affected academic publishing remains an open question. This article examines the rapid and disruptive transformations in the trade and digital publishing world, discusses how these developments have already intersected with the work of academics and considers how these changes might continue to transform the dissemination of academic research in the future.

AB  - Firms can benefit immensely from participating in digital platform ecosystems-specifically, from the shared technological assets and market opportunities offered by the platform owner. Yet, while aligning with the platform ecosystem rules, each member must decide whether to specialize in a given platform ecosystem or across multiple platform ecosystems to capture these benefits. We examine two common patterns through which platform ecosystem members (i.e., complementors) specialize within and across platform ecosystems, and the relative impact on their market performance. We look at the high relative standing of the complementary product as a reflection of complementors' specialization in the given product category or platform ecosystem. We then theorize that having products with high relative standing in a single product category and a single platform ecosystem, together, diminishes complementors' market performance over time. Similarly, high relative standing in multiple platform ecosystems and multiple product categories, at the same time, adversely impacts the market performance. We find supportive evidence for our hypotheses, in a panel dataset of mobile app developers. This paper contributes to the burgeoning stream of research that investigates the trade-offs faced by complementors, suggesting that complementor strategies are more complex than simply trying to maximize market reach.

AB  - Data sharing has become prevalent with the rapid growth of mobile technologies. A lack of awareness and understanding of privacy practices often results in the installation of privacy-invasive applications (apps) which could potentially put users' personal data at risk. This study aimed to explore how users' risk perception could be shifted towards more privacy-aware decisions through generation fluency and framing manipulations. It is an online study composed of three components, an experiment and two questionnaires. We manipulated the availability of privacy worries, by asking participants to generate either 2 or 10 privacy worries. Generating 10 worries was experienced as difficult, whereas generating 2 was easy. The difficult experience led to downgraded perception of risk, and consequently increased likelihood of installing a low privacy rated fictional app. Therefore, we suggest that improving generation fluency of privacy concerns could encourage users' adoption of a more conservative judgment strategy when installing an app, safeguarding them against privacy-invasive apps.

AB  - What can urban big data research tell us about cities? While studying cities as complex systems offers a new perspective on urban dynamics, we should dig deeper into the epistemological claims made by these studies and ask what it means to distance the urban researcher from the city. Big data research has the tendency to flatten our perspective: it shows us technology users and their interactions with digital systems but does so often at the expense of the informal and irregular aspects of city life. It also presents us with the city as optimisable system, offering up the chance to engineer it for particular forms of efficiency or productivity. Both optimisation itself, and the process of ordering of the city for optimisation, confer political and economic power and produce a hierarchy of interests. This commentary advocates that researchers connect systems research to questions of structure and power. To do this requires a critical approach to what is missing, what is implied by the choices about which data to collect and how to make them available, and an understanding of the ontologies that shape both the data sets and the urban spaces they describe.

AB  - Children are growing up in a digital age with increasing exposure to television and touchscreen devices. We tested whether exposure to screen media is associated with children’s early language development. One hundred and thirty-one highly educated caregivers of UK children aged 6–36 months completed a media exposure questionnaire and vocabulary measure. 99% of children were read to daily, 82% watched television, and 49% used mobile touchscreen devices daily. Regression analyses revealed that time spent reading positively predicted vocabulary comprehension and production scores at 6–18 months, but time spent engaging with television or mobile touchscreen devices was not associated with vocabulary scores. Critically, correlations revealed that time spent reading or engaging with other non-screen activities was not offset by time spent engaging with television or mobile touchscreen devices. Thus, there was no evidence to suggest that screen media exposure adversely influenced vocabulary size in our sample of highly educated families with moderate media use.

AB  - In 2014, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation released a five-year plan entitled A Space For Us All. The plan outlined a bold new vision for the Canadian public broadcaster, placing digital mobile content at the forefront of the corporation’s priorities. This article examines the shifting priorities of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation against established principles of public broadcasting. It also interrogates the relationship between mobile digital media and legal obligations of the public broadcaster under current Canadian broadcasting regulation. Drawing upon Canadian broadcasting history, contemporary data and recent examples from sport and politics in Canada, the article questions this new direction for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and argues that despite the significant new opportunities in mobile digital media, traditional broadcasting methods remain the dominant tool to reach mass audiences and will provide a significant forum for public information and debate for the foreseeable future.

AB  - This study adds to the literature on computer-mediated communication (CMC) by examining the impact of online voice recording (VR) activities and peer-to-peer videoconferencing (VC) conversations on the development of beginning Spanish learners’ speaking performance. Specifically, this paper explores (1) whether VR and VC activities promote oral proficiency, and if so, whether those gains can be seen both in presentational and interpersonal modes of communication; and (2) whether VR and VC activities foster oral proficiency in similar ways to face-to-face (F2F) communication. A quasi-experimental, pre-/post-test design was used in the study. Three sections of a first semester Spanish course were assigned to one of the following conditions: F2F, VR, and VC. Complexity, accuracy, and fluency measures were used to analyze learners’ speaking performance in the two tasks. A mixed effects model analysis was used to investigate differences across time as well as among groups. Results show that both F2F communication and VR activities promote complexity and fluency in presentational tasks and fluency in interpersonal tasks, although F2F produces superior results regarding complexity in presentational tasks. VC activities promote complexity and fluency in presentational tasks and complexity, accuracy, and fluency in interpersonal tasks. Overall, this study shows that medium is not merely a delivery device but has important implications for learning outcomes. In this sense, these findings contribute to answering the wider question of how the use of technology in second language instruction plays a decisive role in current teaching practices.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper are twofold: first, develop a novel concept of a mobiquitous home application (Near Field Communication Smartphone Entertainment Systems (NFC SES)) with the use of photo interface and NFC smartphone. Second, examine age-group differences in relation to the influence of intuitive, convenience and perceived usefulness on users' behavioural intention to use NFC SFS.
Design/methodology/approach - Using design science research, NFC SES is developed and a survey of 52 users is conducted to evaluate NFC SES.
Findings - There are age differences in individual behavioural intention to use NFC technology. Convenience appears to be the primary factor for the youths. The adult cohort, in contrast emphasizes intuitive and perceived usefulness as two significant determinants of their behavioural intention to use NFC SES.
Practical implications - This study offers a fresh insight for mobile device manufacturer and application developers to focus their design efforts around three aspects (intuitive, convenience and usefulness) that are desired by different age-group users.
Social implications - The development of NFC SES bridges the gap of cyber-physical spaces by enabling users to automate multiple heterogeneous digital appliances without imposing undue technological effort and inconvenience. NFC SES, operating through a touch-driven interaction between NFC smartphone and photo interface, is likely to be useful for many home users, especially for people with disabilities.
Originality/value - NFC SES contributes in itself as a novel innovation. Additionally, studies on mobile technology largely focus on students as users, and often neglect the adult segment. This study entails a new model for evaluation of NFC technology, by uncovering age differences impacts on new technology adoption.

AB  - This paper finds that policy mixes for mobile broadband diffusion need to be differentiated depending on where a country is situated in three stages of mobile broadband diffusion because as a mobile broadband market grows, demand constraints hindering subscription of mobile broadband will also change. A total of 115 countries are clustered into three groups (Take-off, Fast-Diffusion, and Saturated), categorized by their diffusion rates and diffusion speeds over four years from 2013 to 2016. With pooled and fixed effect panel data models, this paper examines which variables out of 23 explanatory variables were effective in promoting mobile broadband adoption globally. Further, by interacting explanatory variables with two group dummies, this paper identifies differential slope (policy) effects of each explanatory variable on mobile broadband adoption. The paper concludes that, among the three groups, considerable gaps exist in the size of effective policy choice sets: six for Take-off, ten for Fast-diffusion, and thirteen for Saturated, suggesting that the countries in the Take-off stage have a very narrow degree of latitude for developing mobile broadband promotion strategies.

AB  - Presents a study which aims to assess the measurement equivalence (ME) of two sets of data obtained from a questionnaire administered using an online survey and in paper form. The participants were 367 pre-service teachers who were randomly divided into two groups: online and paper-based. Prior to testing for ME, preliminary analyses were performed to ensure that the sample size was adequate and multivariate normality in the data was met. The results support the presence of ME in the data obtained from the online and paper-based surveys in this study, suggesting a lack of significant variance in the data from the two modes of administration. It is expected that with the rapid growth and development of the Internet, the use of online surveys to collect data will increase. In addition, with the advancement of mobile and web 2.0 tools, researchers would be spoilt for choices when deciding which survey platform to use.

AB  - This article briefs the processes regarding surveys. Part of the attractiveness of online research continues to lie in its low cost (see Duffy et al. 2005 for other reasons for its attractiveness). For instance, the cost today for a completed interview through an online omnibus survey can be as low as $2 in the US. In comparison, the cost for a completed interview through a telephone survey employing a dual frame (landline via random digit dialling and mobile phone via direct dialling) methodology can be at least five times higher. In some respects, however, online research has been a victim of its own success. Despite the increase in the number of panels and the development of new ways of accessing and utilising respondents, researchers can still find it difficult to complete the needed number of interviews on time. This is particularly true when the target population is rare or in high demand. For all of these reasons, it is common today for researchers to use more than one sample source for some types of projects, such as a tracking survey that measures change over time.

AB  - The ongoing developments in information technology have resulted in new technologies as a replacement for those already existing. This has led to users resorting to these new technologies, often in parallel to the existing offerings. These users then later decide whether to switch to the new technologies fully, a phenomenon referred to as the 'technology transition'. In this paper, drawing on theories on social psychology, we present a theoretical model for explaining technology transition from an individual's perspective in two geographies (Germany and India). Based on survey responses in the two geographies, we validate the model and demonstrate the country-specific factors influencing an individual's intention to transition to a tablet computer from a conventional computing device. The investigation of technology transition at the individual level is also a contribution to the cross-cultural stream of research and provides a basis for further inquiry in this field.

AB  - Observations on the current stage of the Digital Humanities and their environment identify four dangers: (1) The focus on infrastructures for the Digital Humanities may obscure that research ultimately is driven by analytical methods and tools, not just by the provision of data or publishing tools. (2) Information technology can support the Humanities in many forms and national traditions. That textual analysis is much discussed right now, should not hide the view of a broader disciplinary field. (3) The mobile revolution looming may once again lead to a repetition of highly destructive processes observed at the PC and the internet revolutions. (4) The Digital Humanities may have to take a much stronger part in the development, not only the reception, of technology. A series of concrete and controversial questions, which allow the discussion of some of these trends, is derived. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - This article draws on work from a 6-month project with 12 young mothers in which we mapped and tracked ourselves and our infants. The project employed a range of methods including digital ethnographies, walk-along methods, hacking and playful experimentations. We explored, broke and tested a range of wearables and phone-based tracking apps, meeting regularly to discuss and compare our experiences and interrogate the sociotechnical systems of postnatal healthcare alongside the particular politics of certain apps and their connective affordances. In this article, I use the project as a springboard to explore what I call algorithmic vulnerabilities: the ways that the contemporary datalogical anthropocene is exposing and positioning subjects in ways that not only rarely match their own lived senses of identity but are also increasingly difficult to interrupt or disrupt. While this is not necessarily a new phenomenon (see Clough et al., 2015; Hayles, 2017), I argue that the particular algorithmic vulnerabilities within this context, which are forged in part through the ideological enmeshing of the long-running atomization of maternal and infant bodies within the healthcare systems (Crowe, 1987; Shaw, 2012; Wajcman, 1991) and the new and emergent tracking apps (Greenfield, 2016; Lupton, 2016; O'Riordan, 2017) create momentary stabilizations of sociotechnical systems in which maternal subjectivity and female embodiment become algorithmically vulnerable in affective and profound ways. These stabilizations become increasingly and problematically normative, partly because they feed and perpetuate a wider 'taken-for granted' sensibility of gendered neoliberalism (Gill, 2017: 609) which, as I argue, is coming to encapsulate the contemporary datalogical anthropocene. Secondly, the sociotechnical politics of the apps and the healthcare systems are revealed as co-dependent, raising a number of questions about long-term algorithmic vulnerabilities and normativities which predate the contemporary datalogical 'turn' and impact both practices and methods.

AB  - Prompted by the ongoing development of content personalization by social networks and mainstream news brands, and recent debates about balancing algorithmic and editorial selection, this study explores what audiences think about news selection mechanisms and why. Analysing data from a 26-country survey (N = 53,314), we report the extent to which audiences believe story selection by editors and story selection by algorithms are good ways to get news online and, using multi-level models, explore the relationships that exist between individuals' characteristics and those beliefs. The results show that, collectively, audiences believe algorithmic selection guided by a user's past consumption behaviour is a better way to get news than editorial curation. There are, however, significant variations in these beliefs at the individual level. Age, trust in news, concerns about privacy, mobile news access, paying for news, and six other variables had effects. Our results are partly in line with current general theory on algorithmic appreciation, but diverge in our findings on the relative appreciation of algorithms and experts, and in how the appreciation of algorithms can differ according to the data that drive them. We believe this divergence is partly due to our study's focus on news, showing algorithmic appreciation has context-specific characteristics.

AB  - This article combines data from the British National Readership Survey, the Audit Bureau of Circulations, and comScore to calculate how much audience attention newspapers' print, personal computer (PC), and mobile platforms attract. The results show that, of the time spent with 11 UK national newspaper brands by their British audiences, 88.5 per cent still comes via their print editions, 7.49 per cent via mobiles, and just 4 per cent via PCs. The study reveals that the share of consumption of UK national newspaper brands (when measured by time spent) is less evenly distributed than commonly understood, conforming better to a logarithmic pattern than a linear one, and that a single brandThe Mailhas close to a 30 per cent market share. Such data should inform debates on, and the regulation of, media plurality. For publishers, this research calls into question the transition from print to online, showing how dead-tree editions are their most important platform. However, the circulation of print editions is in steep decline and newspapers' fortunes are falling almost as steeply. Unless the qualities that make newsprint so much more engaging than online journalism can be harnessed to propel a reading resurgence, newspapers' decline will continue, with important social, cultural, and political consequences.

AB  - This study performs comparative and longitudinal analyses of the domestic and overseas consumption (measured by time-spent-reading and popularity) of UK national newspaper brands across their print editions and online channels (excluding mobile "apps"). The study estimates that, in 2011, a minimum of 96.7 per cent of the time spent with newspapers by their domestic audience was in print, with "popular/tabloid" titles least successful in capturing audience attention online. In terms of popularity, the print channel accounted for a majority of domestic daily readers: in 2011 the newspapers studied had an estimated average daily readership per print copy of 2,110,633. By contrast, the average number of online sessions per day was estimated to be between 385,156 and 709,559. Nearly half the newspapers may have increased their aggregated domestic print and online popularity between 2007 and 2011, although those increases have not translated-with one exception-into increases in time spent with those brands. The online channel has increased newspapers' daily overseas audience by between 7 and 16 times. However, because those online readers' visits are relatively brief, the effect on the attention newspapers receive (measured in time) from overseas has been minimal. In fact, two-thirds of the newspapers for which the most recent data were available suffered decreases in the time their overseas readers spent with their print and online channels between 2008/9 and 2011.

AB  - Support groups provide opportunities for participants to express and get in touch with their feelings and emotions. For children such groups provide a non-threatening environment in which they can share their feelings and concerns openly with one another. The wide range of social networking options made easily accessible via mobile technologies has seen children increasingly connecting with their peers in search of emotional support. For parents and professionals alike the question arises as to whether these online groups provide the positive support environment necessary to ensure children feel comfortable sharing their emotional concerns. In this study qualitative content analysis of the communications shared between the young members of an online support group for siblings of children with special needs revealed that participants felt confident to openly express a range of strong feelings and emotions, including hate, love, confusion, hurt, fear, jealousy and embarrassment.

AB  - Supplement 23 to DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications for Medicine), Structured Reporting, is a specification that supports a semantically rich representation of image and waveform content, enabling experts to share image and related patient information. DICOM SR supports the representation of textual and coded data linked to images and waveforms. Nevertheless, the medical information technology community needs models that work as bridges between the DICOM relational model and open object-oriented technologies. The authors assert that representations of the DICOM Structured Reporting standard, using object-oriented modeling languages such as the Unified Modeling Language, can provide a high-level reference view of the semantically rich framework of DICOM and its complex structures. They have produced an object-oriented model to represent the DICOM SR standard and have derived XML-exchangeable representations of this model using World Wide Web Consortium specifications. They expect the model to benefit developers and system architects who are interested in developing applications that are compliant with the DICOM SR specification.

AB  - This article reports from a pilot study that was conducted in a probability-based online panel in the Netherlands. Two parallel surveys were conducted: one in the traditional questionnaire layout of the panel and the other optimized for mobile completion with new software that uses a responsive design (optimizes the layout for the device chosen). The latter questionnaire was optimized for mobile completion, and respondents could choose whether they wanted to complete the survey on their mobile phone or on a regular desktop. Results show that a substantive number of respondents (57%) used their mobile phone for survey completion. No differences were found between mobile and desktop users with regard to break offs, item nonresponse, time to complete the survey, or response effects such as length of answers to an open-ended question and the number of responses in a check-all-that-apply question. A considerable number of respondents gave permission to record their GPS coordinates, which are helpful in defining where the survey was taken. Income, household size, and household composition were found to predict mobile completion. In addition, younger respondents, who typically form a hard-to-reach group, show higher mobile completion rates.

AB  - This article compares the effectiveness of a research messenger layout to a traditional online layout with regards to probing. Responses to different types of probes (explanation, elaboration and category selection probes) were examined in terms of length and quality, measured by number of characters, number of themes, and an indicator for response quality. The research messenger layout, regardless of device being used, had a negative effect on both response length, number of themes and response quality. Further, we found that in both the traditional and research messenger layout, using a mobile device negatively affects the number of characters and themes used in probed responses. We conclude that probing is most effective when a traditional survey is completed on a computer. The research messenger layout was not able to generate responses of similar quality compared to the traditional layout, regardless of device being used.

AB  - In an experiment dealing with the use of personal computer, tablet, or mobile, scale points (up to 5, 7, or 11) and response formats (bars or buttons) are varied to examine differences in mean scores and nonresponse. The total number of not applicable answers does not vary significantly. Personal computer has the lowest item nonresponse, followed by mobile and tablet, and a lower mean score than for mobile. Slider bars showed lower mean scores and more nonresponses than buttons, indicating that they are more prone to bias and difficult in use. Sider bars, which work with a drag-and-drop principle, perform worse than visual analogue scales working with a point-and-click principle and buttons. Five-point scales have more nonresponses than eleven-point scales. Respondents evaluate 11-point scales more positively than shorter scales.

AB  - As a result of the evolution in the field of biometrics, a new breed of techniques and methods for user identity recognition and verification has appeared based on the recognition and verification of several biometric features considered unique to each individual. Signature and voice characteristics, facial features, and iris and fingerprint patterns have all been used to identify a person or just to verify that the person is who he/she claims to be. Although still relatively new, these new technologies have already reached a level of development that allows its commercialization. However, there is a lack of studies devoted to the evaluation of these technologies from a user-centered perspective. This paper is intended to promote user-centered design and evaluation of biometric technologies. Towards this end, we have developed a platform to perform empirical evaluations of commercial biometric identity verification systems, including fingerprint, voice and signature verification. In this article, we present an initial empirical study in which we evaluate, compare and try to get insights into the factors that are crucial for the usability of these systems. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Using images of objects as queries is a new approach to search for information on the Web. Image-based information retrieval goes beyond only matching images, as information in other modalities also can be extracted from data collections using an image search. We have developed a new system that uses images to search for web-based information. This paper has a particular focus on exploring users’ experience of general mobile image-based web searches to find what issues and phenomena it contains. This was achieved in a multi part study by creating and letting respondents test prototypes of mobile image-based search systems and collect data using interviews, observations, video observations, and questionnaires. We observed that searching for information based only on visual similarity and without any assistance is sometimes difficult, especially on mobile devices with limited interaction bandwidth. Most of our subjects preferred a search tool that guides the users through the search result based on contextual information, compared to presenting the search result as a plain ranked list.

AB  - This chapter analyses data from an experiment implemented in 2015 in Spain using the Netquest online panel. The authors administered the same questionnaire to the same respondents in two consecutive waves of data collection, separated by a one-week break. In this work they used a subset of the complete dataset, focusing on 719 respondents who participated in the survey both times using a mobile device. The main objective was to study if the screen size affects four different indicators: completion time, failure to answer an Instructional Manipulation Check question, answer consistency, and evaluation of the survey experience. The chapter evaluates if and how the screen size of mobile devices can affect data quality on web surveys, measured by four indicators. It uses data from a two-wave crossover experiment implemented in 2015 within the opt-in online panel Netquest, in Spain. Following a review of relevant literature, the chapter introduces the hypotheses, and then presents details of the data collection methodology and analytic approach. The chapter concludes by presenting the particular findings and outlining broader implications for surveys using mobile devices. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - More and more respondents use mobile devices to complete web surveys. These devices have different characteristics, if compared to PCs (e.g. smaller screen sizes and higher portability). These characteristics can affect the survey responses, mostly when a questionnaire includes sensitive questions. This topic was already studied by Mavletova and Couper (2013), through a two-wave experiment comparing PCs and mobile devices results for the same respondents in a Russian opt-in panel. We replicated this cross-over design, focusing on an opt-in panel for Spain, involving 1,800 panellists and comparing PCs and smartphones. Our results support most of Mavletova and Couper's (2013) findings (e.g. generally the used device does not significantly affect the reporting of sensitive information), confirming their robustness over the two studied countries. For other results (e.g. trust in data confidentiality), we found differences that can be justified by the diverse context/culture or by the quick changes that are still characterizing the mobile web survey participation.

AB  - SMS language is regarded as a 'new' communication system (cf. T. Shortis 2007; D. Crystal 2009; M. Markus 2010) characterized by new relationships that native speakers establish between English spelling and pronunciation by using different respelling devices (cf. C. Thurlow 2003; P. López Rüa 2007; D. Crystal 2009). This paper is an attempt to contribute to this recent area of study by analysing the development of SMS language over the last 10 years. Recent findings suggest that even though SMS language might have emerged out of the need for speed and brevity (C. Thurlow 2003:4) - every SMS has a limited amount of characters -, it seems to have evolved into a fashionable and stylish way of writing where shortened versions of the words are not always the aim of the respelling. For the purpose of a diachronic analysis a free online British SMS corpus available at netting-it.com containing 201 text messages compiled in 2000 has been used in comparison with my own data obtained in May 2010 by means of questionnaires carried out in a London secondary school. Thus, it was possible to analyse the differences in the use of SMS language during the last decade. The research proves that one of the most significant changes is the use of 'stylish talk' a new device which consists in lengthening words to emphasize accent, slang, and attitude. This contrasts with the general belief that words are merely shortened in SMS language. Moreover, the use of slang and ungrammatical expressions also seem to be frequent devices.

AB  - Purpose - Following the recommendation of the food and agriculture organization of the United Nations in agricultural innovation, for taking advantage of emerging technologies, in benefit of small-farmers, the present study explores one of the most ancient crops in the world that privileging the application of tacit knowledge, to become a succulent plant called agave, into the so-called drink of the gods, the mezcal. For this, the purpose of this study is to discover innovation opportunities and reconfiguring knowledge interaction dynamics of the agricultural artisan production of agave-mezcal from Oaxaca, Mexico, using emerging technologies
Design/methodology/approach - Following a qualitative-quantitative approach, the study was carried out with 44 mezcal producers from Oaxaca, Mexico, through face-to-face session, questionaries' application and field visits, based on the model of socialization, externalization, combination and internalization (SECI) through Likert-scale questions, combining the non-parametric statistical analysis and digital compass, for the detection of technological opportunities
Findings - Basing on artisanal process, context-knowledge place, technological resources and SECIs model results, the opportunities must go in the route of labour in the logic of digital performance. In this sense, becomes relevant to develop an easy-use mobile application for improving the interaction of mezcaleros with external agents and another's producers., A second proposal is the creation of mezcaltech-hub, thinking as collaborative space, for promoting the interaction producer-to-producer and producer-to-external agent.
Originality/value - The value of the present study is the empirical description of knowledge dynamics interaction contained in the agricultural artisan production of agave-mezcal through SECI model; the identification of problems, failure or barriers contained in the knowledge interaction dynamics of the agricultural artisan production agave-mezcal; the proposal of innovation opportunities for reconfiguring the knowledge interaction dynamics of the agricultural artisan production agave-mezcal from a developing economy, using emerging technologies

AB  - Does completing a web survey on a smartphone or tablet computer reduce the quality of the data obtained compared to completing the survey on a laptop computer? This is an important question, since a growing proportion of web surveys are done on smartphones and tablets. Several earlier studies have attempted to gauge the effects of the switch from personal computers to mobile devices on data quality. We carried out a field experiment in eight counties around the United States that compared responses obtained by smartphones, tablets, and laptop computers. We examined a range of data quality measures including completion times, rates of missing data, straightlining, and the reliability and validity of scale responses. A unique feature of our study design is that it minimized selection effects; we provided the randomly determined device on which respondents completed the survey after they agreed to take part. As a result, respondents may have been using a device (e.g., a smartphone) for the first time. However, like many of the prior studies examining mobile devices, we find few effects of the type of device on data quality.

AB  - With respondents increasingly completing web surveys on tablet computers and smartphones, several studies have examined the potential effects of the switch from PCs to mobile devices. The studies have looked at a range of outcomes, including completion rates, breakoffs, and item nonresponse. We carried out a field experiment that compared responses obtained by smartphones, tablets, and laptop computers, focusing on the potential effects of the different devices on measurement errors. We examined whether the differences across devices in screen size (and the related need to scroll to see the entire question or the full set of response options) might moderate the effects of response order, affect the strategy respondents used to decide which of two options was preferable, change the effect of question context, or influence the use of definitions. Our experiments were based on the principle of visual prominence-the idea that respondents are more likely to notice and consider information that is easy to see. The experiments were deliberately designed to maximize the impact of screen size on the results, since the screen size would affect the visual prominence of key information. However, like many of the prior studies examining mobile devices, although response order, context, and evaluation strategy affected the answers respondents gave, few device effects emerged.

AB  - The gambling industry has offered self-exclusion programs for quite a long time. Such measures are designed to limit access to gaming opportunities and provide problem gamblers with the help they need to cease or limit their gambling behaviour. However, few studies have empirically evaluated these programs. This study has three objectives: (1) to observe the participation in an improved self-exclusion program that includes an initial voluntary evaluation, phone support, and a mandatory meeting, (2) to evaluate satisfaction and usefulness of this service as perceived by self-excluders, (3) to measure the preliminary impact of this improved program. One hundred sixteen self-excluders completed a questionnaire about their satisfaction and their perception of the usefulness during the mandatory meeting. Among those participants, 39 attended an initial meeting. Comparisons between data collected at the initial meeting and data taken at the final meeting were made for those 39 participants. Data showed that gamblers chose the improved self-exclusion program 75% of the time; 25% preferred to sign a regular self-exclusion contract. Among those who chose the improved service, 40% wanted an initial voluntary evaluation and 37% of these individuals actually attended that meeting. Seventy percent of gamblers came to the mandatory meeting, which was a required condition to end their self-exclusion. The majority of participants were satisfied with the improved self-exclusion service and perceived it as useful. Major improvements were observed between the final and the initial evaluation on time and money spent, consequences of gambling, DSM-IV score, and psychological distress. The applicability of an improved self-exclusion program is discussed and, as shown in our study, the inclusion of a final mandatory meeting might not be so repulsive for self-excluders. Future research directives are also proposed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Since early in the development of children’s television, research has informed policy and practice involving young children’s media use. To increase the likelihood that new media support children’s development, research in the coming decade must stay current with advancing technology. With the advent of various forms of interactive digital media, key research questions involve social and physical interactivity. How should adults appropriately support children’s use of different kinds of media to promote children’s creativity, learning, and development? How does co-viewing (social interaction) overlap with and differ from contingency built into the medium itself? When a device interacts, does that change the kind of support required of a co-viewing adult, or eliminate the need for such support? How does the introduction of new technology impact the lives of families? Issues related to video chat, touchscreen and motion capture technology, artificial intelligence, and electronic books and games are discussed.

AB  - Header images are typically included in web surveys to make surveys more appealing for respondents. However, headers might also induce a systematic bias in response behavior. In order to examine both the potential effects (more specifically, effects on motivation and context effects) of header images with respondents using different devices, an experiment embedded in a web survey on students' time use and stress was conducted using a probability sample of 1,326 students at the University of Bonn. Respondents were presented either with a picture of an auditorium with students sitting in a class, a picture of leisure activities on campus, or no picture, respectively. To control for position effects, pictures were placed either in the upper right or upper left of the questionnaire. The results indicate that header images attract attention in the beginning of a survey, but do not significantly increase motivation over the course of the survey. When faced with a header picture, respondents in the picture conditions evaluate their time in class differently compared to respondents in the control group. While the device providing the visibility makes no difference, effects are only significant when the picture is placed on the left side of the screen. In sum, the interaction of header placement and the content-related proximity of header content and question may alter response behavior.

AB  - Motorcyclist safety is a major concern in many developing countries. Understanding motorcycle riders’ risky behaviours, particularly among the younger population, is essential to developing effective interventions. This paper explores the correlations between mobile phone use while riding and other risky riding behaviours as well as the relationships between perceived risks and risky riding behaviours, using an online survey of university students in Vietnam. Results show that calling while riding a motorcycle had the highest prevalence (74%) while reckless overtaking had the lowest prevalence (33.2%). Survey participants who indicated that they had the behaviours of reckless overtaking or riding on sidewalks were around twice as likely to call, text, or search for information while riding. In addition, those who admitted that they rode a motorcycle while under the influence of alcohol were nearly twice as likely to call or text while riding. The results also show that perceived crash risks reduced the likelihood of risky riding behaviours, including calling, texting, searching for information, speeding, running red lights, riding on the wrong side of a road, and riding on sidewalks. A more coordinated approach to enforcement is needed to help reduce the prevalence of multiple risk taking behaviours among motorcyclists. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - E-books and e-Reading Devices (E-RDs) markets have been enlarged due to the rapid progress of digital technologies. What are the possible factors to increase readers’ willingness to use electronic devices? To improve the predictive value of the original TAM model, this study incorporates three additional constructs to form e-Reading Device Acceptance Mode: reading self-efficacy, computer self-efficacy and perceived enjoyment. This model consists of six constructs and 11 research hypotheses. The research questionnaires were distributed in Taiwan, and the research results showed that reading self-efficacy shows positive influences on readers’ intention to use the E-RDs. On the contrary, computer self-efficacy does not show positive influences on perceived usefulness or perceived enjoyment. Moreover, the perceived ease of use of E-RDs does not show significant impacts on readers’ intention to use the devices. Explanations of the causes and reasons are given in this paper, and the finding of this research may provide useful references and materials for e-book publishers, e-reading device developers, and researchers for further studies.

AB  - Purpose Mobile instant messaging (MIM) apps could provide rich and instant information in employees' communication. However, how media richness impacts MIM user loyalty is unknown. The purpose of this paper is to adopt media richness and social presence theories as theoretical foundations to address this insufficiency. Design/methodology/approach Collecting 247 responses from an online survey, the authors use structural equation modelling for data analysis and hypothesis testing. Findings The authors found that immediate feedback and personal focus are the main aspects of media richness that are positively related to social presence, relatedness need satisfaction and user loyalty to MIM. Originality/value This is the first study using two pertinent theories to explain how aspects of media richness affect user loyalty to MIM. The present findings suggest that firms developing MIM apps focus on immediate feedback and personal focus as effective means to encourage user loyalty.

AB  - Purpose - No studies in the extant literature have explored the role of media richness, i.e., the ability of media to enhance understanding among communication partners in a timely manner, in determining customer loyalty to mobile instant messaging (MIM). Grounded in media richness theory, the purpose of this paper is to examine how media richness influences customer perceived values, consequently contributing to customer loyalty to MIM.
Design/methodology/approach - Collecting data by an online survey, the authors apply partial least square procedures for hypothesis testing.
Findings - The authors obtain the following findings: multiple cues are positively related to functional value; immediate feedback is positively related to social value; personal focus is positively related to self-expressive value; language variety is positively related to all the above values that lead to user loyalty; and language variety has the strongest effect on user loyalty to MIM.
Originality/value - A first attempt to examine the impact of media richness on user loyalty to MIM, this study provides insights for MIM service providers to make decisions to build loyal user bases.

AB  - Cannabis and tobacco/nicotine use are highly comorbid. Given expanding access to cannabis through legalization for recreational use, it is important to understand how patterns of cannabis and tobacco/nicotine co-use are associated with young adult outcomes. A predominantly California-based sample of 2,429 young adults (mean age = 20.7) completed an online survey. Based on past-year reports of cannabis and tobacco/nicotine use, we defined 5 mutually exclusive groups: (a) single-product use; (b) concurrent use only (using both products, but only on separate occasions); (c) sequential use only (using both products on the same occasion, one right after the other, but not mixing them together); (d) coadministration only (using both products on the same occasion by mixing them in the same delivery device); and (e) both sequential use and coadministration. We examined group differences in use patterns, dependence, consequences of use, and psychosocial functioning. Fifty percent of respondents reported cannabis use, 43% tobacco/nicotine use, and 37% co-use of both substances. The most prevalent method of co-use involved smoking combustible products. Overall, individuals who co-used both substances on the same occasion in some way reported heavier use and greater problematic behaviors than those who did not. Sequential use (especially among those that also engaged in coadministration) was typically associated with worse physical and mental functioning overall compared to using each substance separately. Findings illuminate both prevalence and risks associated with co-use of cannabis and tobacco/nicotine products and can inform policies for states considering regulation of cannabis and tobacco/nicotine products.

AB  - Internet technologies have impacted the form and function of social movement activities such that mainstream environmental organizations (MEO) and environmental justice organizations (EJO) have begun to adopt and use various technologies to achieve organizational goals. Given the critical role of internet technologies on social movement activity, the current project contributes to the literature on social movement activity online through a two part analysis including a mail survey and a web-based content analysis. Specifically, the digital divide is observed among EJOs and MEOs: MEOs demonstrate higher rates of adoption and more frequent use of various technologies as compared to their EJO counterparts. Most notably MEOs adopt organizational websites, use e-mail more frequently, have more technology personnel and engage in general computer use at rates higher than their EJO counterparts. Video cameras are the only technology under analysis that was adopted by EJOs at higher rates than their MEO counterparts. In terms of the purpose of use, both had attempted to solicit donations online but again, MEOs did so with greater success as compared to EJOs. Through the web-based analysis MEOs demonstrated higher complexity of their online presence as compared to EJOs with EJOs being less likely to have an online presence at all. Further, organizations with the most functional sites tended to be MEOs which hosted greater interactivity. Overall, it was clear that MEOs have established greater and more complex online presence compared to EJOs. Further studies might consider questions regarding whether these differences in use translate to higher rates of organizational goal attainment. Additionally, future studies can incorporate analyses of the nuances of mobile Internet access given the substantial growth of this means of access especially among Black and Latino users.

AB  - The author explores communication mobility and its implications for those who live in the upper strata of the advanced industrial societies. The professionals who 'phone it in' are scrutinized from a sociological view. So too are today's teens who apparently experience Paris as an opportunity for texting rather than a romantic or political engagement. Mobile connectivity while away from home leaves little time to inquire, as perhaps both Adolph Hitler and Jacques Chirac did in their day, 'Is Paris Burning?' She also examines the digital dustbin awaiting those who are no longer wanted in the brave new technological world. In the process of her examination, she raises important questions about the use of human beings as the opportunities grow to leave emotional work to the infinite patience of robotic pets.

AB  - We describe our use of contradictions, a concept central to a popular formulation of activity theory, to derive requirements of a new technical system to support an administrative system. Contradictions are the underlying causes of disturbances in the free operation of workplace activities. We argue and demonstrate that the resolution of such contradictions can be used as the basis for the (user-centred) design of a new system. We conclude that contradictions are both conceptually valuable in understanding the design of systems and are of considerable practical use. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The communications field must challenge traditional understandings of media in the face of a transformation in the dynamics of capitalism that prioritizes the generation of value from data based on continuous surveillance. New advertising and data-processing developments mean that while the term media may continue to attach to the distribution of narratives, researchers must now conceive it as the convergence of message-circulation technologies with data-extraction-and-analysis technologies that are linked to everyday objects increasingly typical of our new mobile personalization era. In fact, nothing less than a radical revision of the boundaries of the communications field is required to adequately address the fundamentally altered social and economic order emerging from this ferment in the field of everyday life itself.

AB  - Self-regulated learning (SRL) is useful for understanding self-directed learning practices. However, SRL behaviours - despite being deemed highly context-dependent - remain mostly unexplored for healthcare workers in low-income countries. This study details how SRL strategies vary and impact on healthcare providers' learning gains when using digital learning platforms. We apply Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) to questionnaire responses from a sample of 264 healthcare providers, arguably the first time LPA has been applied for the context in this subject-domain. We identified four SRL profiles: High, Above-Average with Low Help-Seeking, Average, and Low SRL profiles with significant differences in SRL strategies between the four profiles confirmed by Kruskal-Wallis test and logistic regression. Healthcare providers with more specialised clinical training were most likely to be in the Low SRL profile, but compared to the other profiles, maximised possible learning gains in the fewest learning iterations. From our findings, SRL may not adequately represent the nature of the interaction between these learners and contextual characteristics. Exploring the important role of various external learning regulation behaviours that influence healthcare providers SRL might help address this shortcoming. These findings provide insights into the learner factors to consider when implementing technology-mediated learning in these resource-contexts. They also offer plausible future research directions into how to maximise healthcare providers' learning gains on digital platforms that is informed by how learners in low-income contexts regulate their self-directed learning.

AB  - A recent hypothesis in empirical brain research on language is that the fundamental difference between animal and human communication systems is captured by the distinction between finite‐state and more complex phrase‐structure grammars, such as context‐free and context‐sensitive grammars. However, the relevance of this distinction for the study of language as a neurobiological system has been questioned and it has been suggested that a more relevant and partly analogous distinction is that between non‐adjacent and adjacent dependencies. Online memory resources are central to the processing of non‐adjacent dependencies as information has to be maintained across intervening material. One proposal is that an external memory device in the form of a limited push‐down stack is used to process non‐adjacent dependencies. We tested this hypothesis in an artificial grammar learning paradigm where subjects acquired non‐adjacent dependencies implicitly. Generally, we found no qualitative differences between the acquisition of non‐adjacent dependencies and adjacent dependencies. This suggests that although the acquisition of non‐adjacent dependencies requires more exposure to the acquisition material, it utilizes the same mechanisms used for acquiring adjacent dependencies. We challenge the push‐down stack model further by testing its processing predictions for nested and crossed multiple non‐adjacent dependencies. The push‐down stack model is partly supported by the results, and we suggest that stack‐like properties are some among many natural properties characterizing the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms that implement the online memory resources used in language and structured sequence processing.

AB  - Objective: India reported its first coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case in the state of Kerala and an outbreak initiated subsequently. The Department of Health Services, Government of Kerala, initially released daily updates through daily textual bulletins for public awareness to control the spread of the disease. However, these unstructured data limit upstream applications, such as visualization, and analysis, thus demanding refinement to generate open and reusable datasets. Materials and Methods: Through a citizen science initiative, we leveraged publicly available and crowd-verified data on COVID-19 outbreak in Kerala from the government bulletins and media outlets to generate reusable datasets. This was further visualized as a dashboard through a front-end Web application and a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) repository, which serves as an application programming interface for the front end. Results: From the sourced data, we provided real-time analysis, and daily updates of COVID-19 cases in Kerala, through a user-friendly bilingual dashboard (https://covid19kerala.info/) for nonspecialists. To ensure longevity and reusability, the dataset was deposited in an open-access public repository for future analysis. Finally, we provide outbreak trends and demographic characteristics of the individuals affected with COVID-19 in Kerala during the first 138 days of the outbreak. Discussion: We anticipate that our dataset can form the basis for future studies, supplemented with clinical and epidemiological data from the individuals affected with COVID-19 in Kerala. Conclusions: We reported a citizen science initiative on the COVID-19 outbreak in Kerala to collect and deposit data in a structured format, which was utilized for visualizing the outbreak trend and describing demographic characteristics of affected individuals.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to develop an evolutionary transaction cost economics approach capable of explaining the rise and fall of global network alliances once created to provide global services to multinational companies. In this global services market, market contracting and integrated corporations eventually replaced global network alliances. Both inefficiently designed or applied governance and efficiently realigned governance may explain why alliances failed and subsequently were replaced by more appropriate market contracting and integrated firms. The global alliance story also illustrates the point that economic actors initially may not have the requisite capacity to look ahead and recognize contractual hazards, but that such capacity and recognition may gradually evolve as a product of negative experience. © The Author 2008.

AB  - A generation of consumers have now grown up in the digital age, intimately connected to a host of digital tools. This generation, which we call Digital Natives, has become a prime target for mobile operators due to their size, spending power, and use intensity. In addition, they tend to be influential trend setters when it comes to the adoption of new digital solutions. In the dynamic emerging economy of Turkey, they are of even greater interest to mobile operators as they surpass their peers in many advanced economies in terms of use intensity. Despite its importance, our knowledge of the loyalty and churn behavior of this customer segment is very limited. We respond to this research gap by drawing insights from a comprehensive survey of digital natives in the Turkish context. The empirical data originates from a survey of 2000 Turkish university students. We employ Binomial Logistic Regression analysis which provides interesting managerial and public policy insights. Our findings demonstrate that such customer service factors as call quality, billing and brand image affect both the loyalty and churn intentions of Turkish Digital Natives. Surprisingly, youth loyalty club programs, duration of subscription, and prior churn experience are found to be not significant. These results lead to practical implications for mobile providers and telecom regulators operating in Turkey and elsewhere. • Turkish digital natives in this rapidly transforming economy represent a very active user group and also serve as opinion leaders in the telecom market. • The present study investigates those factors that shape the churn and loyalty decisions among Turkish digital natives in telecommunications sector. • The findings suggest that churn and loyalty intentions of Turkish digital natives are affected by customer service metrics, data usage, mobile operators, type of plan, and campaign awareness. • Moreover, previous churn experience and membership in loyalty programs do not appear to significantly impact dependent variables.

AB  - The digital turn, and with it increased use of location-aware technologies, has yielded innovative image applications and posed new questions about the status and value of the image. These applications rely on algorithmically defined relations between the viewing subject and the world viewed, offering robust alternatives to the visual economies of the past. If we take seriously Heidegger's insights regarding the Welt-bild as a metaphor for the modern era, the algorithmic reconfiguration of subject-object relations in this emerging visual regime potentially offers insights through which we can reflect upon the current era -- and a metaphoric alternative. This article uses two entry points to explore this possible reconfiguration and, with it, the question of value. Downloadable applications such as Photosynth aggregate location-tagged photographs into a near-seamless whole, and offer a way to consider such issues as collaborative authorship of the image, unstable points of view and the repositioning of subject-object relationships -- all elements that fundamentally challenge western representational norms dominant in the modern era. In this new regime, the spatial referents of greatest value are points of uniqueness sought out and built upon by the program's algorithms -- and not those perceived by the viewer. The viewer is in turn free to explore an extensive and dynamic image space unconstrained by (and, indeed, without access to) an authorised or 'correct' viewing position. A second case, built upon certain augmented reality applications, works by 'recognising' particular spaces and, through the use of computationally enhanced viewing screens, superimposing new images over real space. In this case, a system of virtual spatial annotation depends upon the 'correct' positioning of the viewer (and portable computing device) in the world. The two cases stand in a roughly reciprocal relationship, turning on different notions of algorithmic intermediation and subject-object relations and dynamics for the generation of meaning and value.

AB  - The ICT infrastructure transformations for integrating cloud, software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) are emerging extensively to satisfy dynamic user requirements on diversified functionalities over large-scale resource pools. These infrastructure transformations are causing new sets of operational problems for operators, as a consequence of inadequate end-to-end visibility and visualization support about underlay infrastructure. Particularly, for multi-tenant/multisite underlay infrastructure, resource monitoring and associated flow identification are major challenges. To address these operational challenges, precise visibility monitoring and interactive visualizations are essential. Therefore, in this paper, by realizing an interactive visualization of multi-layer (i.e. resource-layer and flow-layer) visibility, we address the real-world operational issues of experimental SDN-enabled distributed clouds, denoted as OF@TEIN and OF@KOREN Playgrounds. By leveraging SmartX MultiView Visibility Framework, we first strive to enable visibility collection and validation. We then link it with subsequent visibility integration capability empowered by DataLake-based visibility storage. Additionally, by taking the example of OF@TEIN and OF@KOREN Playgrounds, we present verification results on prototype implementations. The results justify the proposed approach for timely unveiling critical operational issues by efficaciously leveraging the multi-layer visibility.

AB  - Since the 1950s, views of Earth from above have been critiqued for provoking detachment from and decontextualization of human, terrestrial concerns. These critiques thus establish Earth's enveloping atmosphere as the ultimate context for meaningful and grounded accounts of humanness, and outer space as a site for abstract, generalizable knowledge. But in outer space, the explanatory work done by "context" is put in question, because spacefaring humans must attend to basic and constantly shifting conditions for life that lie beyond "context" on Earth, including breathing. Attention to humans in real and speculative space environments reveals context as a naturalizing device that establishes universal nature/culture distinctions through recourse to grounding terrestrial ontologies.

AB  - Mobile instant messaging services (MIMS) are emerging as important digital environments in citizens’ everyday lives. We explore the use of MIMS for talking about politics with unique survey data on samples representative of Internet users in Germany, Italy, and the UK. First, we show that robust percentages of our respondents who use MIMS employ them for posting political messages and discussing politics. Second, we demonstrate that political talk on MIMS is positively associated with users’ tendency to censor themselves politically on social networking sites (SNS) and, to a lesser extent, with ideological extremism. Third, we find that the association between self-censorship on SNS and the likelihood of publishing political contents on MIMS is stronger for individuals living in former East Germany where, due to historical reasons, large segments of the population are reluctant to talk about politics in public. Our findings suggest that MIMS make a distinctive contribution to contemporary repertoires of political talk, with important implications for the quality and inclusiveness of interpersonal political discussion.

AB  - News is increasingly being consumed on a multitude of media devices, including mobile devices. In recent years, mobile news consumption has permeated individuals' news consumption repertoires. The main purpose of this study is twofold: (a) gain insight in how mobile news outlets infiltrated the broader news media repertoires of mobile device owners and (b) understand in what circumstances mobile news is consumed within these news media repertoires. The key is to understand how and why this widening agency in appropriating various places and social spaces in everyday life relates to general news media consumption (Peters, 2012). This two-phased study aims to illuminate how mobile device owners position their mobile news consumption in relation to other types of news media outlets. First, a guiding cluster analysis of a large-scale questionnaire (N = 1279) was performed, indicating three types of news consumers. Second, in order to thicken the originally derived clusters, a mixed-method study was set up, combining objective data originating from mobile device logs with more subjective audience constructions through personal diaries and face-to-face interviews (N = 30). This study reveals the Janus-faced nature of mobile news. On the one hand, the majority of news consumers dominantly relies on traditional media outlets to stay informed, only to supplement with online mobile services in specific circumstances. Even then, there is at least a tendency to stick to trusted brand materials. On the other hand, these mobile news outlets/products do seem to increasingly infiltrate the daily lives of mobile audiences who were previously disengaged with news.

AB  - This paper describes a survey based on SMS messaging, presenting details of the tests and pilots undertaken, the practical difficulties found and overcome, as well as an examination of the differences found between the CATI and SMS elements of the survey. It also describes pilot surveys undertaken to test mixed mode methods: SMS-td-online and SMS-to-IVR (interactive yoke response). As the paper describes, Network Research has a long-standing relationship with a top service provider, which interacts with its customers through high-street outlets, by phone and online. For the past 15 years and more Network Research has conducted customer satisfaction surveys to cover all those interactions, mainly using computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI). Throughout the relationship with this client, Network Research has periodically investigated different means of data collection as an alternative or adjunct to CATI. Its primary motivation has been to seek more cost-efficient ways of collecting timely data (proximate to a specific event) from the customer base. Cost saving is not the only criterion, however. Consideration has also to be given to impact on the customer; attribution, confidentiality and data protection issues; potential biases leading to skewed and unrepresentative scores (non-response, age, gender, geographic); representing outlet and organisation structure; and scalability. Considerable time and effort has gone into refining the CATI approach to render it as cost- and methodologically efficient as possible. Nonetheless CATI is still, relative to other options like online or other self-completion methods a higher cost approach. However, it is also the 'gold standard' on each of the non-cost criteria above. Pure online surveys have limited application for this client: among all but digital customers, very few customer email addresses are available. Where online research is conducted, the surveys generally suffer from low response rates. In 2015, Network Research started to supplement CATI data for the largest of the customer satisfaction surveys, among high-street customers, with a survey based on SMS messaging (or 'text messaging' via mobile phone). This paper will be of interest to anyone who is contemplating using SMS methodology.

AB  - Although a number of instruments have been used to measure Internet skills in nationally representative surveys, there are several challenges with the measures available: incompleteness and over-simplification, conceptual ambiguity, and the use of selfreports. Here, we aim to overcome these challenges by developing a set of reliable measures for use in research, practice, and policy evaluations based on a strong conceptual framework. To achieve this goal, we carried out a literature review of skillsrelated studies to develop the initial Internet skills framework and associated instrument. After the development of this instrument, we used a three-fold approach to test the validity and reliability of the latent skill constructs and the corresponding items. The first step consisted of cognitive interviews held in both the UK and the Netherlands. Based on the cognitive interview results, we made several amendments to the proposed skill items to improve clarity. The second step consisted of a pilot survey of digital skills, both in the UK and in the Netherlands. During the final step, we examined the consistency of the five Internet skill scales and their characteristics when measured in a representative sample survey of Dutch Internet users. The result is a theoretical, empirically and cross-nationally consistent instrument consisting of five types of Internet skills: operational, navigation information, social, creative, and mobile.

AB  - For a long time, a common opinion among policy-makers was that the digital divide problem would be solved when a country?s Internet connection rate reaches saturation. However, scholars of the second-level digital divide have concluded that the divides in Internet skills and type of use continue to expand even after physical access is universal. This study?based on an online survey among a representative sample of the Dutch population?indicates that the first-level digital divide remains a problem in one of the richest and most technologically advanced countries in the world. By extending basic physical access combined with material access, the study finds that a diversity in access to devices and peripherals, device-related opportunities, and the ongoing expenses required to maintain the hardware, software, and subscriptions affect existing inequalities related to Internet skills, uses, and outcomes.

AB  - This article examines the extent to which economic, cultural, social, and personal types of engagement with the Internet result in a variety of economic, cultural, social, and personal outcomes. Data from a representative survey of the Dutch population are analyzed to test whether engagement with a certain type of activity is related to collateral benefits in different domains of activities, independent from the socioeconomic or sociocultural characteristics of the person. The results show that what people do online and the skills they have affect outcomes in other domains and that this is independent of the characteristics of the person. This means that policy and interventions could potentially overcome digital inequalities in outcomes through skills training and providing opportunities to engage online in a broad variety of ways. A semiologic rather than an economistic approach is more likely to be effective in thinking about and tackling digital inequalities.

AB  - The present study investigates the role of process and social oriented smartphone usage, emotional intelligence, social stress, self-regulation, gender, and age in relation to habitual and addictive smartphone behavior. We conducted an online survey among 386 respondents. The results revealed that habitual smartphone use is an important contributor to addictive smartphone behavior. Process related smartphone use is a strong determinant for both developing habitual and addictive smartphone behavior. People who extensively use their smartphones for social purposes develop smartphone habits faster, which in turn might lead to addictive smartphone behavior. We did not find an influence of emotional intelligence on habitual or addictive smartphone behavior, while social stress positively influences addictive smartphone behavior, and a failure of self-regulation seems to cause a higher risk of addictive smartphone behavior. Finally, men experience less social stress than women, and use their smartphones less for social purposes. The result is that women have a higher chance in developing habitual or addictive smartphone behavior. Age negatively affects process and social usage, and social stress. There is a positive effect on self-regulation. Older people are therefore less likely to develop habitual or addictive smartphone behaviors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years, organised student mobility within the European space has increasingly caught the interest of scholarly researchers. As the focus of most research projects has been on the outcome of mobility programmes, studies into the determinants of credit student mobility remain rather focused on individual decision-making. However, in order to gain a more profound understanding of how students' motivations to participate in international mobility programmes are shaped, we have to go a step further. Therefore, in this paper, we present a study into the determinants of intra-European student mobility, conducted in Austria, Belgium, Italy, Norway, Poland, and UK, taking into account students' personal background and motivations. The results are based on an online survey (n=5654) and in-depth interviews and focus groups with non-mobile as well as ex-mobile students (n=71). The results show that mobility decisions are socially and biographically embedded. Moreover, we provide evidence that the decision to spend a study period abroad cannot be fully understood without taking into consideration the macroeconomic context.

AB  - Studies on European identity generally focus on elites, even though processes of identity formation may also take place in other societal domains. As one of the underlying rationales of European student exchange programmes is the promotion of European citizenship, I examine empirically the influence of European student mobility on European identity. The analysis is based on a mixed-method approach. The quantitative element consists of an online survey at nine universities in Austria, Belgium, Italy, Norway, and Poland at the end of the 2008-2009 academic year. The qualitative element consists of 40 in-depth interviews and five focus groups, conducted at the universities of Antwerp, Innsbruck, Oslo, Rome, and Warsaw in 2009-2010. The analysis underpins the need for incorporating an 'experience-based' social dimension into the existing theoretical frameworks of political and cultural dimensions of European identity. This creation of an 'experience-based social Europe' among mobile students is the result of socialisation processes that are characterised by internal and external identity observations and goes beyond the political unit of the European Union. However, regional differences can be observed and partially attributed to macro-factors such as the (non-)participation of a country in the European Union. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Background: Continued low adherence to physical activity recommendations illustrates the need to refine intervention strategies and increase their effectiveness. The purpose of this study was to conduct formative research related to the development of a next generation of computer-tailored interventions that use online tailored video-messages to increase physical activity. Methods: Five focus groups (n = 30), aimed at males and females, aged between 35 and 60 years, that do not meet the physical activity recommendation, were conducted to allow in-depth discussion of various elements related to the development of an online video-tailored intervention. In addition, a series of questions were delivered to a random sample (n = 1261) of Australians, using CATI survey technology, to gain more information and add a quantitative assessment of feasibility related to the development of the intervention. Focus group data was transcribed, and summarised using Nvivo software. Descriptive and frequency data of the survey was obtained using SPSS 18.0. Results: Nearly all of the focus group participants supported the concept of a video-tailored intervention and 35.8% of survey participants indicated that they would prefer a video-based over a text-based intervention. Participants with a slow internet-connection displayed a lower preference for video-based advice (31.9%); however less than 20% of the survey sample indicated that downloading videos would be slow. The majority of focus group and survey participants did not support the idea of using mobile phones to receive this kind of intervention and indicated that video-tailored messages should be shorter than 5 minutes. Video-delivery of content is very rich in information, which increases the challenge to appropriately tailor content to participant characteristics; focus-group outcomes indicated a large diversity in participant preferences. 52.4% of survey participants indicated that the videos should be convincing and motivating. Conclusions: These results provide valuable information to develop an innovative video-tailored physical activity intervention. The results support the feasibility of such intervention, both in terms of users being ready to participate in it, as well as from a point of view whereby current internet infrastructure is able to cope with the demands of downloading videos. Though promising, a number of specific challenges in the development of these interventions were identified (e.g. the videos need to be short, made professionally, and tailor to a larger number of variables) and will need to be overcome in the development and evaluation of this new type of physical activity intervention.

AB  - In recent years, mobile phones have become an increasingly important component in survey data collection. This holds true for self-administered questionnaires and particularly for interview surveys, where mobile phones enforce the combination with other survey modes. However, whether to include mobile phones in a particular survey design depends on complex cost-error relationships. To address this issue, the authors elaborate a metric-based on a product of costs and estimates of survey errors-that is then used for post survey comparison of design alternatives. The authors illustrate this approach with a simulation study using parameters from empirical research. The results show that such evaluation can potentially change the selection of the preferred design option compared to situations where only some of the components (e. g., response rate, nonresponse bias) are used for evaluation. More specifically, the decision about the inclusion of mobile phones predominantly depends on their bias-removing potential, while it is much less sensitive to changes in costs and other error parameters.

AB  - Mobile phones have become central to family members? daily communication. This study investigates the material and skills access barriers that parents of adolescents in resource-constrained contexts face for mobile relational maintenance. Following an exploratory sequential mixed-methods design, interviews with parents in Bogotá, Colombia, explored how they managed to keep in touch with their children despite facing access barriers and how these barriers still affected their parent?child mobile interactions. A survey was conducted in the quantitative phase to confirm the relationship patterns suggested by qualitative findings. Financial, cognitive, and environmental resources constituted access barriers. Despite gaining material access through alternative social and environmental resources, the barriers they faced still influenced the nature and frequency of their parent?child mobile interactions. Findings also showed that cognitive barriers, observed as parents? low levels of perceived capability to learn how to use mobile phones, affected parents? text messaging through their acquisition of skills.

AB  - In a networked society, humans are connected through mobile devices to always-on networks, and these technologies merge with us in new ways. In this environment, studying human-networked interactions involves an expanded type of usability. In this article, we argue that a key component of usability is how humans connect and disconnect from these networks. For this reason, the authors advocate studying how users connect and disconnect between online and offline contexts in their everyday life. Such an effort involves questioning our assumptions about the role of connection in usability and introduces methodological issues in studying these processes. These shifts require our research to be more multidisciplinary and more methodologically demanding, with major implications for the portability and durability of technical communication research.

AB  - Abstract: Purpose: Smartphones facilitate the potential adoption of new mobile applications. The purpose of this research is to study users and non-users of three selected mobile applications, and find out what really drives the intention to use these applications across users and non-users. Design/methodology/approach: The authors measured actual usage of mobile applications in a panel study of 579 Finnish smartphone users, using in-device measurements as an objective way to identify users and non-users. A web-based survey was used in collecting data to test an extended TAM model in explaining intention to use. Findings: Perceived technological barriers negatively affect behavioural control, reflecting people’s assessment of themselves being capable of using the services without trouble. Behavioural control is directly linked to perceived usefulness (except for games) and perceived enjoyment, as hypothesized. Perceived enjoyment and usefulness were generically found to explain intention to use applications for both users and for non-users. Research limitations/implications: With regards to the impact of social norms, the study finds that further research needs to be done in exploring its impact more thoroughly. The dataset of the research, consisting purely of male-dominated, young smartphone users, make the generalization of results difficult. Practical implications: There are differences regarding what drives the usage of different kinds of mobile applications. In this study, map applications and mobile Internet, are driven by more utilitarian motivations, whereas games are more hedonic. It is also clear that not everybody are using applications facilitated by smartphones, and therefore the presented approach of studying users and non-users separately provides a new approach to analyze adoption on a practical level. Originality/value: This research proves that models like TAM should not treat mobile services as a generic concept, but instead to specifically address individual mobile services. The research also demonstrates the unique value of combining objective usage measurements (reflecting actual behaviour) with traditional survey data in more comprehensively modelling service adoption.

AB  - The representation and manipulation of sound within multimedia systems is an important and currently under-researched area. The paper gives an overview of the authors' work on the direct manipulation of audio information, and describes a solution based upon the navigation of four-dimensional scaled timbre spaces. Three hardware input devices were experimentally evaluated for use in a timbre space navigation task: the Apple Standard Mouse, Gravis Advanced Mousestick II joystick (absolute and relative) and the Nintendo Power Glove. Results show that the usability of these devices significantly affected the efficacy of the system, and that conventional low-cost, low-dimensional devices provided better performance than the low-cost, multidimensional dataglove.

AB  - Objective: To reduce pathogen exposure, conserve personal protective equipment, and facilitate health care personnel work participation in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, three affiliated institutions rapidly and independently deployed inpatient telemedicine programs during March 2020. We describe key features and early learnings of these programs in the hospital setting. Methods: Relevant clinical and operational leadership from an academic medical center, pediatric teaching hospital, and safety net county health system met to share learnings shortly after deploying inpatient telemedicine. A summative analysis of their learnings was re-circulated for approval. Results: All three institutions faced pressure to urgently standup new telemedicine systems while still maintaining secure information exchange. Differences across patient demographics and technological capabilities led to variation in solution design, though key technical considerations were similar. Rapid deployment in each system relied on readily available consumer-grade technology, given the existing familiarity to patients and clinicians and minimal infrastructure investment. Preliminary data from the academic medical center over one month suggested positive adoption with 631 inpatient video calls lasting an average (standard deviation) of 16.5 minutes (19.6) based on inclusion criteria. Discussion: The threat of an imminent surge of COVID-19 patients drove three institutions to rapidly develop inpatient telemedicine solutions. Concurrently, federal and state regulators temporarily relaxed restrictions that would have previously limited these efforts. Strategic direction from executive leadership, leveraging off-the-shelf hardware, vendor engagement, and clinical workflow integration facilitated rapid deployment. Conclusion: The rapid deployment of inpatient telemedicine is feasible across diverse settings as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Mobile phones are the most accessible information and communication technology today, and they serve as the gateway to high-speed internet for large populations in developing economies. However, despite the progress, there remains a persistent disparity in mobile phone usage among users, and between users and non-users, in developing countries. However, the literature on the digital divide has paid limited attention to the multi-level nature of this gap in mobile phone adoption and use, particularly in developing countries. This research paper provides a comparative analysis of this divide in mobile phone usage in eight developing nations from Africa and Asia. Broadly, the study categorises individuals into three groups: mobile phone non-users, mobile phone users who do not use internet applications and mobile phone users who use applications that need internet access. The disparity between these users was analysed using micro-level survey data from each country. The study results show that the nature of the divide varies across countries and that the influence of socio-demographic factors is not consistent. Further, we find that there is a larger digital divide in terms of mobile phone usage in Asian countries when compared to African countries. The study recommends that policymakers and international agencies exercise caution while developing one-size-fits-all cross-country policies to address the multi-level digital divide.

AB  - Augmented reality (AR) is a rapidly emerging technology that superimposes digital objects onto real-world scenes as viewed in real time through a smartphone, tablet, or headset. Whereas AR has been adopted for retail, entertainment, and professional training, it also has potential as a novel, mobile, and efficacious treatment modality for psychological disorders. In particular, extinction-based therapies (e.g., anxiety, substance use disorders) could utilize AR to present stimuli in natural environments, enhancing generalizability beyond the clinic. The limited psychological literature on AR has focused on the treatment of simple phobias. Here, with the goal of bringing this technology to the attention of clinicians and researchers, we describe AR, contrast it with virtual reality, review the theoretical foundation for extinction-based therapies, provide examples for the treatment of substance use disorders, and identify theoretical, practical, and implementation-based research questions.

AB  - Parametric methods are recognized as a very useful tool for reusing code and augmenting the expressiveness of an object-oriented language providing parametric classes. This paper focuses on their implementation techniques for Java. Existing proposals for extending Java with parametric polymorphism are outlined, showing and discussing the basic implementation techniques: type-erasure, code-expansion and type-passing. Up until now, only type-erasure and code-expansion have been exploited for the implementation of parametric methods, but they suffer from some problems. Basically, type-erasure is unable to support parametric types at run-time, while code-expansion generally leads to significant increase of both disk and memory overhead. The main goal of this paper is to study a type-passing approach aimed at tackling these issues. This is based on the management of method descriptors, which are objects passed to the method bodies at invocation-time, and which carry information on the instantiation of the method's type parameters. Run-time efficiency is guaranteed thanks to a special treatment of descriptors deferring their creation at load-time. Dynamic dispatching of method calls is supported by exploiting a data structure called the Virtual Parametric Methods Table, resembling Virtual Methods Tables of C++. The approach here presented turns out to be a significant alternative to the existing proposals for implementing generics in Java, supporting parametric types at run-time without unnecessary code footprint.

AB  - The organisation of actual design activities, even by experts involved in routine tasks, is not appropriately characterised by the retrieval of pre-existing plans, but is opportunistic (possibly with hierarchical episodes at a local level, but not globally hierarchical). Actually executed design actions depend, at each moment t, on the evaluation of actions proposed at t−1. These proposals can be made by pre-established plans, but also by other action-proposal knowledge structures. This position is supported by results from diverse empirical design studies. A major reason why design activities are organised opportunisically is that, even if designers possess plans which they may retrieve and use, the designers very often deviate from these plans so that their activities satisfy action-management constraints, of which the most important is cognitive economy. Two types of variables underlying this opportunism are discussed: situational and processing. © 1994 Butterworth-Heinemann Ltd.

AB  - Background: With the availability of mobile smart devices, many adolescents have developed the habit of being online and connected with other users almost all the time. Objective: The aim of this paper is to provide a definition of being permanently online (PO) and permanently connected (PC) and to explore students’ current PO/PC behaviors. Methods: An online survey was conducted with 178 university students in Germany to explore the intensity of their PO/PC behaviors in various social situations, the differences in being PO and being PC, students’ feelings about a possible loss of Internet access, and their online responding behaviors. We also shed some light on the associations between being PO/PC and various aspects of well-being, as well as between PO/PC and demographics and lifestyle. Results: Smart device usage behaviors at night and behaviors in various social situations during the day indicate that PO and PC behaviors are occurring frequently. The results show that being connected to others (PC) seems to be more relevant to the participants than browsing the web (PO). Moreover, the participants expressed strong emotional responses about a temporary loss of Internet access. Coping behaviors in response to increasing number of incoming messages and permanent availability are reported. Conclusion: This exploratory study demonstrates the relevance of the concepts of being PO and PC to students, and points out further research gaps.

AB  - Australian drivers' use of hand-held mobile phones is increasing in prevalence, despite the illegal nature of this behaviour. Research investigating the psychosocial influences on drivers' intentions to use hand-held mobile phones is limited. The present research utilised the theory of planned behaviour, extended with descriptive norm, to investigate the psychosocial influences on drivers' intentions to use a hand-held mobile phone. The behaviours associated with mobile phone use were categorised into initiating and responding behaviour. Answering calls and reading text messages were categorised as responding behaviour, on the basis that these two behaviours have been associated with social pressure to respond. Making calls and sending text messages were categorised as initiating behaviour. A sample of 181 drivers from the general population, aged 18-66 years, completed an online survey. The survey assessed attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control, descriptive norm, past behaviour and intention, in relation to initiating and responding behaviour. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control and descriptive norm were all significant predictors of drivers' intentions to engage in both initiating and responding behaviour. However, drivers reported significantly greater intentions to engage in responding behaviour and reported engaging in responding behaviour more frequently than initiating behaviour, indicating that social pressure to respond may play an important role in drivers' illegal use of hand-held mobile phones.

AB  - Purpose/Objective: Our goal was to examine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of an app-based coaching intervention (Social Participation and Navigation; SPAN) to help survivors of acquired brain injury attain social participation goals. Research Method/Design: This is a nonrandomized pilot trial of SPAN, including 15 adolescents (9 with traumatic brain injury, 6 with brain tumor) between the ages of 14–22. The SPAN intervention consisted of a mobile app to support the development and implementation of social participation goals, weekly video-conference coaching sessions to identify goals and step-by-step action plans, and online didactic materials. Assessments were completed pre- and postintervention. Satisfaction with the intervention, confidence in the adolescents’ ability to participate in and plan social activities and manage their emotions and behaviors, and frequency and satisfaction with social participation were assessed via self- and parent-report questionnaires developed for this project. Behavior problems, social competence, and social problems were measured by using the Child Behavior Checklist and the Youth Self-Report. Results: High levels of participant and parent satisfaction were reported. Increases in parent-reported frequency of social participation and teen-reported confidence in their ability to participate and develop social participation goals and plans were observed. A decline in parent-reported total problems, internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and social problems was noted. Conclusion/Implications: Results support the feasibility of the program, because participants were able to successfully meet with their coaches and use the app to develop and accomplish social participation goals. Further research will be needed to refine the app and program, particularly when reaching out to populations beyond traumatic brain injury.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between e-marketing (eM) and consumers' buying behavior particularly exploratory buying behavior tendencies (EBBT) with moderating effect of a gender in the context of China.
Design/methodology/approach Structural equation modeling using SPSS/AMOS was majorly applied to ascertain the relationship and hypotheses testing. First, the correlation of eM toward EBBT is examined using five factors: internet marketing (IM), e-mail marketing (EMa), intranet marketing (IMa), extranet marketing (EM), and mobile marketing (MM). Second, the relationship of each dimension of the eM model is determined autonomously to ensure the importance of such emerging technologies in marketing communications. Third, the effect of gender as a moderator is measured. To this end, primary data were collected through random distribution of the questionnaires among 1,600 consumers particularly students of the universities between February 2016 and August 2016 within North China.
Findings The findings revealed that eM has a significant correlation on consumers' EBBT. The comprehensive analysis of each factor of eM, i.e., IM, EMa, IMa, EM, and MM is positively correlated to EBBT. The present study revealed that gender did not moderate among the relationships of eM and EBBT. Additionally, study furnishes practical directions on how managers can utilize such emerging and revolutionary technologies in marketing activities to probe, understand, and reinforce consumers' buying behavior.
Research limitations/implications The research has limitations related to geographical location and sample size which thus limits the widespread generalization.
Practical implications This study affirmed that organizations must engage the consumers using such technologies that are more likely acceptable by consumers in the present customer-oriented and digital era. The marketers must engage consumers the way they wish to be engaged by developing appropriate promotional strategies. The study provides possible implications both theoretical and managerial along with a contribution to the literature of eM and consumers' buying behavior.
Social implications Understanding the emerging technologies may furnish valuable insights for individuals to work well within Chinese SMEs.
Originality/value The topic of eM has acknowledged as an evolving concept which is gaining an intense concern of both academician and practitioners. Therefore, more research mainly empirical work is still needed to probe the insights of eM across the globe. This study attempts to fulfill such need with empirical evidence together with an in-depth examination of eM determinants, collectively and autonomously.

AB  - Short Message Service (SMS) is one of the most widely used data services worldwide. This paper examines the assumption that the 160-character limit would force brief and thus comparatively uninformative responses in psychological research compared to other data collection modes. In laboratory classes, 463 psychology undergraduate students were randomly assigned to complete a 2-item questionnaire by SMS, e-mail, online survey, or paper survey. 2 weeks later, participants completed a multiple-choice self-report risk taking questionnaire on paper. While SMS response lengths were statistically significantly shorter than those yielded in other modes, they did not contain less information.

AB  - Little is known about the psychological underpinnings of young people’s mobile phone behaviour. In the present research, 292 young Australians, aged 16–24 years, completed an online survey assessing the effects of self-identity, in-group norm, the need to belong, and self-esteem on their frequency of mobile phone use and mobile phone involvement, conceptualised as people’s degree of cognitive and behavioural association with their mobile phone. Structural equation modelling revealed that age (younger) and self-identity significantly predicted the frequency of mobile phone use. In contrast, age (younger), gender (female), self-identity and in-group norm predicted young people’s mobile phone involvement. Neither self-esteem nor the need to belong significantly predicted mobile phone behaviour. The present study contributes to our understanding of this phenomenon and provides an indication of the characteristics of young people who may become highly involved with their mobile phone.

AB  - When using Short Message Service (SMS) as a tool for data collection in psychological research, participants can be contacted at any time. This study examined how sampling frequency and time of day of contact impacted on response rates, response completeness, and response delay in repeated measures data collected via SMS. Eighty-five undergraduate students completed a six-item self-report questionnaire via SMS, in response to 20 SMS prompts sent on a random schedule. One group responded across 2 days, the other on a compressed schedule of 1 day. Overall, there was a high response rate. There was no significant difference in response rate, completeness, and delay of those responding across 1 or 2 days. Timing between prompts did not impact on response behavior. Responses were more likely to be complete if prompts were sent during the working day. The shortest time between prompts was 15 min, however, and use of an undergraduate sample limits generalizability. When conducting repeated measures sampling using SMS, researchers should be aware that more frequent sampling can be associated with poorer data quality, and should aim to collect data during the working day rather than mornings or evenings.

AB  - This research explores how cues deposited by social partners onto one's online networking profile affect observers' impressions of the profile owner. An experiment tested the relationships between both (a) what one's associates say about a person on a social network site via "wall postings," where friends leave public messages, and (b) the physical attractiveness of one's associates reflected in the photos that accompany their wall postings on the attractiveness and credibility observers attribute to the target profile owner. Results indicated that profile owners' friends' attractiveness affected their own in an assimilative pattern. Favorable or unfavorable statements about the targets interacted with target gender: Negatively valenced messages about certain moral behaviors increased male profile owners' perceived physical attractiveness, although they caused females to be viewed as less attractive. © 2008 International Communication Association.

AB  - Online food delivery service has developed rapidly and expanded the boundaries of the catering industry. Being a food delivery rider in the gig economy attracts workers with the premises of flexibility and freedom. However, existing studies based on labor process theory revealed that freedom is fictitious. The study sheds light on how the individual rider finds meaning in their work from the mobility perspective. A mixed-method approach based on questionnaires, interviews, and mobile ethnography is applied. Findings showed that food delivery riders gain the experience of freedom in many aspects, from flexible working hours, body movement, immediate cash transfer to freedom from many other regulations. Being a rider represents a free lifestyle and a way to control one's fate. Yet, it is perceived as a transitional job. This study contributes to making connections between the mobility perspective and work-related studies.

AB  - The role of working memory (WM) components, such as phonological loop, in online inferential processing has thus far not been empirically examined with a dual-task paradigm. The current study used an online method to examine the effects of the two components of phonological loop-the articulatory rehearsal device and the phonological store device-on online causal inference generation during Chinese text reading. Eighty-five Chinese university students read three-sentence inference and control texts and responded to comprehension questions related to targeted inferences in different reading conditions. The results showed that in the articulatory suppression condition, response times (RTs) for comprehension questions of inference texts were considerably longer, and response errors were significantly higher than those in the normal reading condition, which indicated the effects of the articulatory rehearsal device on readers' online causal inference processes during Chinese text reading. Moreover, RTs for comprehension questions of inference texts in the irrelevant speech condition were significantly shorter than those in the normal reading condition, suggesting effects of the phonological store device on readers' causal inference processes during reading. Taken together, these findings indicate that the articulatory rehearsal device plays an important role in inference processes, but readers allocate more cognitive resources to facilitate the construction of causal relations during text-based inferential comprehension when function of the phonological store device is impaired.

AB  - Information and communication technology (ICT) is a key driver of urbanization but can also create the digital divide that hinders urbanization. The study aims to explore the dynamic relationship among ICT, the digital divide and urbanization in China. Employing data collected from prefecture-level cities in 2017, this study first constructs a composite urbanization index through principal component analysis (PCA), then applies geographically-weighted regression (GWR) model and partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLSSEM) to probe the effects of ICT on overall urbanization. The results suggest that ICT positively affects urbanization and directly improves urbanization levels and efficiency. The application of mobile phones is an indispensable tool for future urban development. However, there are digital divides among areas. Less-developed cities lag behind well-developed ones due to their poor basic conditions and low-levels of ICT perception among residents. Therefore, knowing how to boost ICT development, narrow the digital divide and promote urbanization is of great importance. The essential role of the government in urbanization and technological progress emphasized, and it is believed that government-led ICT-based urbanization can alleviate the digital divide and achieve balanced regional development.

AB  - Purpose This research investigates whether and how perceived firm remorse (PFR) influences consumers' coping behaviors in the digital media service recovery context. It also examines how an apology should be delivered to generate PFR. Design/methodology/approach In Study 1, 452 mobile application service users were recruited for a survey study, and Structural Equation Modeling was used to test the research hypotheses. In Study 2, 1,255 mobile application service users were recruited for an experimental study. Findings Study 1 shows that PFR negatively influences blame attribution and positively influences emotional empathy. Emotional empathy negatively affects coping behaviors. According to this study, blame attribution and emotional empathy do not have any serial mediation effect on the relationship between PFR and coping behaviors. Only emotional empathy mediates the effect of PFR on coping behaviors. Study 2 finds that response time and apology mode jointly influence PFR. Research limitations/implications This research establishes the relationship between PFR and coping behaviors and shows the mediating role of emotional empathy in this relationship. Practical implications Service providers should consider response time and apology mode, as the two factors jointly influence the extent of PFR, which affects consumers' coping behaviors through emotional empathy. A grace period, in which PFR does not decrease, is present when a public apology is offered. Such an effect does not exist when a private apology is offered. Originality/value This research explains how PFR influences coping behaviors and demonstrates how apology mode moderates the effect of response time on PFR in the digital media service recovery context.

AB  - In this study, the researcher aimed to develop a mobile‐assisted learning system and to investigate whether it could promote teenage learners' classical Chinese learning through the flipped classroom approach. The researcher first proposed the structure of the Cross‐device Mobile‐Assisted Classical Chinese (CMACC) system according to the pilot survey and reviewed literature, and then adopted a quasi‐experimental design to understand whether the developed system could promote and support flipped classroom learning for classical Chinese. A total of 56 eleventh graders from two classes participated in the experiment. The learners in the experimental group learned classical Chinese with the flipped classroom learning strategy with the assistance of the CMACC system, while the control group adopted the flipped classroom learning strategy without using the CMACC system. The results reveal that all of the students improved their Chinese performance, but it was noticeable that the learners who used the CMACC system showed better motivation in terms of self‐directed preview learning, while those who only learned with the traditional textbooks tended to be more passive. In sum, the mobile‐assisted learning system added value in providing learners with opportunities to achieve anytime and anywhere flipped classroom learning. The integration of ubiquitous mobile learning technology and the flipped classroom strategy can be viewed as a critical factor leading to students achieving self‐regulated learning. It is also suggested that instructors should carefully take the targeted learners' cultural background and the availability of supporting learning devices into consideration so as to prevent the flipped classroom from exacerbating the digital divide. Other suggestions for educators and instructional designers are also proposed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Compulsive smartphone use has attracted extensive social attention because of serious and even fatal outcomes associated with it. However, there has been little theory-driven research systematically investigating the mechanism of compulsive behavior in smartphone use. Although a significant line of literature exists in the area of personal-computer based technology addiction, the mechanism underpinning compulsive smartphone use differs significantly because the unique and specific characteristics of smartphones have given rise to a fundamentally different usage context with new usage behavioral patterns. In order to comprehensively theorize this issue, we first defined compulsive behavior in smartphone use, focusing on mobile social networking services (SNSs) in particular, and then extended the stimulus-response-reinforcement framework to investigate the theoretical network of compulsive use of mobile SNSs. We used online survey data from 368 active mobile SNS users in China to empirically test and validate the proposed model and hypotheses. Our results indicate that both positive and negative reinforcements, as well as the compensatory component, invoke the feeling of urge that leads to compulsive mobile SNS use. The positive effects of interactivity as an incentive stimulus on those reinforcements and compulsive mobile SNS use were also found to be significant.

AB  - Chinese classrooms, whether on school grounds or online, have long suffered from a lack of interactivity. Many online classes simply provide recorded instructor lectures, which only reinforces the negative effects of passive non participatory learning. At Shanghai Jiaotong University, researchers and developers actively seek technologic interventions that can greatly increase interactivity in large blended classes. They developed a cutting-edge mobile learning system that can deliver live broadcasts of real-time classroom teaching to students with mobile devices. Their system allows students to customize means of content-reception based on when and where they tune into the broadcast. The system also supports short text messaging and instant polls. Through these venues, students can ask questions and make suggestions in real time, and the instructor can address them immediately. This article describes this system in detail, and also reports results from a formal implementation of the system in a blended English classroom of 1000 students (with about 800 being online). As the data reveal, m-learning activities can much better engage students in the learning process. Students in this class changed from passive learners to truly engaged learners who are behaviorally, intellectually and emotionally involved in their learning tasks.

AB  - Success in web services cannot promise the success in corresponding mobile services. To understand the mobile service adoption behavior under the context of web–mobile service transition, this study, taking mobile eWOM services as an example, investigates the role of trust in mobile service adoption and empirically examines the trust transfer mechanism. Specifically, trust in web services and two relationship-relevant factors namely functional consistency and perceived entitativity are proposed as the predictors of trust in mobile services. A field survey with 235 mobile eWOM services users is conducted to test the research model and hypotheses. The key findings include (1) trust in mobile services positively influences intention to use mobile services; (2) trust in web services, functional consistency and perceived entitativity positively influence trust in mobile services; (3) functional consistency positively influences perceived entitativity. Limitations, theoretical and practical implications are also discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This is an ongoing research project, which has developed an 'Instant Questioning-Answering (iQA) system.' With the iQA system, it is expected that when learners have any questions about learning contents and cannot ask teachers or well-performing peers face to face, they can use their mobile smart devices to ask questions online via browsers or Apps and immediately obtain different levels of feedback to assist their learning. The iQAsystem allows teachers to launch several chat rooms and Answering Robots at the same time. To improve the operational effectiveness of the iQA system and make the Answering Robot provide answer feedback more precisely to those learners who raise questions, the contents of the QA database are constantly enhanced. The effectiveness of Chinese word segmentation also plays an important role. Currently, a new Chinese word segmentation system embedded in the iQA system has been developed to improve the effectiveness of Chinese word segmentation.

AB  - Few studies have examined the relationship between family functioning, social support and quality of life in patients with anxiety disorder. There is a paucity of research on anxiety disorders and their predictors in China. This study aimed to explore family functioning, social support and quality of life for patients with anxiety disorder and examine the relationship between these elements. A total of 107 patients who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; DSM-IV) criteria for anxiety disorder and 80 healthy controls completed the McMaster Family Assessment Device, the Perceived Social Support Scale and the short form of the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire. The findings indicate that patients with anxiety disorder in China tend to have poor family functioning and quality of life, as well as a higher subjective perception of social support. There were strong correlations between family functioning, social support and quality of life. Affective involvement and not living with parents were identified as risk factors for anxiety disorders, while a high family income was a protective factor. Anxiety disorder is associated with reduced family functioning and poorer quality of life for Chinese patients. In addition, the Family Assessment Device is a suitable instrument for evaluating family functioning in Chinese patients with anxiety disorder.

AB  - Measuring the success of mobile government (m-government) is a significant challenge faced by the public sector today, as governments are increasingly using mobile technology to provide public services to citizens and m-government endeavors have often fallen short of their potential. To address this gap, we draw on DeLone and McLean’s (2003) updated information systems (IS) success model in order to develop an m-government success model that theorizes service quality as comprising online and offline service quality and further uses perceived value to measure net benefits. The results of a survey of 286 m-government users in China indicate that information quality and online service quality, but not system quality, are positively associated with citizen satisfaction, which in turn is positively associated with perceived value. The results also show that the relationship between online service quality and citizen satisfaction is positively moderated by offline service quality, while citizen satisfaction partially mediates the relationships between information quality/online service quality (but not system quality) and perceived value. This study extends the updated IS success model by differentiating between online and offline service quality, as well as by introducing the notion of perceived value. Our results provide guidance to researchers and practitioners regarding the role of service quality and perceived value in measuring m-government system success.

AB  - Objective: Develop and evaluate a foundational oncology-specific standard for the communication and coordination of care throughout the cancer journey, with early-stage breast cancer as the use case. Materials and Methods: Owing to broad uptake of the Health Level Seven (HL7) Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture (C-CDA) by health information exchanges and large provider organizations, we developed an implementation guide in congruence with C-CDA. The resultant product was balloted through the HL7 process and subsequently implemented by two groups: the Health Story Project (Health Story) and the Athena Breast Health Network (Athena). Results: The HL7 Implementation Guide for CDA, Release 2: Clinical Oncology Treatment Plan and Summary, DSTU Release 1 (eCOTPS) was successfully balloted and published as a Draft Standard for Trial Use (DSTU) in October 2013. Health Story successfully implemented the eCOTPS the 2014 meeting of the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) in a clinical vignette. During the evaluation and implementation of eCOPS, Athena identified two practical concerns: (1) the need for additional CDA templates specific to their use case; (2) the many-to-many mapping of Athena-defined data elements to eCOTPS. Discussion: Early implementation of eCOTPS has demonstrated successful vendor-agnostic transmission of oncologyspecific data. The modularity enabled by the C-CDA framework ensures the relatively straightforward expansion of the eCOTPS to include other cancer subtypes. Lessons learned during the process will strengthen future versions of the standard. Conclusion: eCOTPS is the first oncology-specific CDA standard to achieve HL7 DSTU status. Oncology standards will improve care throughout the cancer journey by allowing the efficient transmission of reliable, meaningful, and current clinical data between the many involved stakeholders.

AB  - As revealed by Tapscott in his best-seller The Digital Economy published in 1994, the Internet has dramatically changed the way of conducting business and our daily lives. Further advancement of digital innovation, including cloud, mobile services, and artificial intelligence, has augmented this change significantly and provided us with extraordinary services and welfare never anticipated before. However, contrary to such an accomplishment, productivity in industrialized countries now confronts an apparent decline raising the question of a possible productivity paradox in the digital economy. The limitations of gross domestic product (GDP) statistics in measuring the advancement of the digital economy have become an important subject. While this mismatch is an old problem rooted in the dynamics of product innovations, since mismatch brought about by information and communication technology (ICT) is very strong, finding a solution to this critical issue has become highly crucial in the digital economy. Based on an intensive review of preceding studies and empirical analyses of national, industrial and individual behaviors in the digital economy, this paper attempted to draw a perspective on this critical issue. By means of an analysis of co-evolution among a shift in people's preferences from economic functionality to supra-functionality beyond economic value, the advancement of ICT and paradigm change to uncaptured GDP, a solution to this critical issue was investigated. New insights for measuring the digital economy were explored which provide insight into integration of national accounts with product-oriented micro-analysis efforts.

AB  - Cell-phone-only (CPO) households differ along key variables from non-CPO households, creating potential coverage biases in landline-only random-digit-dialing (RDD) surveys. Researchers have attempted to correct for this by weighting their data based on demographic differences. Previous research, however, has not examined CPO coverage biases in media-use surveys?an important oversight as cell phone use is itself a media choice. This article presents a secondary analysis of Pew?s 2012 media consumption survey and concludes that demographics alone are not adequate controls for the CPO bias in media-use surveys.

AB  - This exploratory online questionnaire-based study confirms the findings from earlier studies in the pre-smart phone era regarding consumers’ negative attitudes towards mobile marketing communications. This study shows that these attitudes persist despite increasing frequency of use and increased functionality of mobile phones in the smart phone era. Consumers perceive their mobile device to be for personal communication, and prefer to be able to exercise control over their interaction with organisations. Findings suggest that acceptance can be enhanced by permission marketing, trust-building, creating a sense of being in control, and useful and entertaining website content. Accordingly, pull technologies seem to hold particular promise for mobile marketing communications. This study, therefore, proceeds to explore use of and attitudes towards an important pull technology, QR codes. QR codes, two-dimensional bar codes, can be scanned to provide access to websites, information and applications. Despite their potential, uptake is low. Users in this study who had scanned a QR code had used them to access a variety of different content on different types of items and in different locations. The most frequently accessed type of content was information on a web site, the two most common locations for a scanned QR code were a newspaper or magazine advert, or outdoor advert or poster, and the two most common locations at which scanning was performed were in the street and at home. Ease of use, utility and incentives are drivers to continued use whilst lack of knowledge about how-to scan or of the benefits of QR codes may hinder adoption. Recommendations are offered for practice and for further research. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Abstract: This study draws on the uses and gratifications framework to examine expanded use of a hybrid medium—the mobile phone—for mass communications and entertainment. Results of a telephone survey of 208 users show different motivations predict diverse uses of the mobile phone. Instrumental use motives drive the use of the mobile phone for news-seeking and Web-surfing. Further, the motive of pass time is significantly linked to playing video games via the mobile phone. In addition, the high-tech mobile phone enabled users to be more active: the more intensively people use mobile phones for voice calls, the more likely they will be to use mobile data services. Thus, the hybrid mobile phone bridges interpersonal and mass communication. Finally, younger users are more likely to use mobile phones for getting news and entertainment. Implications for the industry and recommendations for future research are discussed. [Copyright &y& Elsevier]

AB  - There is a limited body of experimental research examining the comparability of completing self-report surveys using different computerized devices. Additionally, available literature has not used complete or optimal procedures for determining device equivalence. The current study examined the comparability of surveys completed using paper-and-pencil and three popular devices: smartphone, tablet, and desktop computer. Participants consisted of 211 college students randomly assigned to conditions who completed measures of personality, social desirability, and computer self-efficacy. Results showed evidence of qualitative equivalence (internal consistency and subscale intercorrelations) across conditions. For quantitative and auxiliary equivalence, both equivalence testing and Bayesian analyses were conducted. Equivalence testing indicated quantitative (mean score) equivalence, as well as comparability for one aspect of auxiliary equivalence (missing data). Other aspects of auxiliary equivalence (completion time and comfort completing questionnaires) suggested potentially meaningful differences. Bayesian analyses typically replicated these results, with some notable exceptions regarding auxiliary equivalence.

AB  - In four survey experiments we show that people generally answer more extremely to survey items presented in vertical versus horizontal Likert formats. Our findings suggest that this effect may be at least partly driven by differences in the visual range spanned by the response scale (i.e. the visual distance between endpoint response categories is larger in horizontal than in a vertical format). In addition, compared to traditional horizontal Likert data, vertical Likert data contain more variance, which is mainly non-substantive. As a result, data obtained with scale formats that have different distances between response categories (as is typically the case for vertical vs. horizontal formats) may lead to differences in measurement model parameter estimates like residual terms, and in some cases factor loadings and construct correlations. Based on these results, we provide recommendations on the use of response scale formats in online surveys, bearing in mind that several online survey tool providers promote the use of vertical Likert formats and even automatically change traditional horizontal formats of Likert-type items to vertical Likert formats when viewed on small screens (e.g., on mobile phones).

AB  - The dramatic rise of smartphones has profound implications for survey research. Namely, can smartphones become a viable and comparable device for self-administered surveys? The current study is based on approximately 1,500 online U.S. panelists who were smartphone users and who were randomly assigned to the mobile app or online computer mode of a survey. Within the survey, we embedded several experiments that had been previously tested in other modes (mail, PC web, mobile web). First, we test whether responses in the mobile app survey are sensitive to particular experimental manipulations as they are in other modes. Second, we test whether responses collected in the mobile app survey are similar to those collected in the online computer survey. Our mobile survey experiments show that mobile survey responses are sensitive to the presentation of frequency scales and the size of open-ended text boxes, as are responses in other survey modes. Examining responses across modes, we find very limited evidence for mode effects between mobile app and PC web survey administrations. This may open the possibility for multimode (mobile and online computer) surveys, assuming that certain survey design recommendations for mobile surveys are used consistently in both modes.

AB  - Using data from the Second Youth Internet Safety Survey, a nationally representative telephone survey of 1,500 youth Internet users (ages 10 to 17), this study explores differences in Internet use characteristics between high risk youth and other Internet users. Those youth who engaged in aggressive behavior online and those who used the Internet on a cell phone were about twice as likely to be classified as high risk (having experienced high parent conflict or child maltreatment) as compared to other Internet users. Those youth who talked with known friends online were significantly less likely to be included in the high risk group. Controlling for demographic and Internet use characteristics, youth who received an aggressive sexual solicitation were almost 2.5 times as likely to report experiencing physical abuse, sexual abuse or high parent conflict. Implications for prevention are discussed, including avenues for reaching high risk populations of youth.

AB  - Survey completions on mobile devices have been increasing rapidly. This important shift is something market researchers should definitely consider when designing and conducting self-administered online surveys. This article briefly summarises existing research and empirical results from mobile surveys. Based on the specific findings discussed, market researchers should be better aware of what to expect when fielding surveys completed by mobile respondents, whether this is intended or not. Bringing the findings together and discussing more broadly, for online surveys, market researchers should consider consciously and deliberately accommodating both mobile and PC respondents. Thus far, the research on mobile surveys indicates that consumers want the choice and ability to take surveys when they want, where they want and on the device of their choosing. It is to be hoped that market researchers are listening and become willing to accommodate survey respondents in terms of device and, by extension, time and location.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationships between women entrepreneurs' firm performance and two dimensions (enrichment and interference) of the business-family interface (BFI) in the moderating context of the level of economic development in two emerging countries - Morocco and Turkey. The enrichment perspective was operationalized as family instrumental (financial) and affective (moral) support, while interference was operationalized as gender-related personal problems.
Design/methodology/approach - The study drew upon the work-family interface (WFI) theory from the family embeddedness perspective in the context of institutional economics. In Morocco, a purposive sample of 116 women entrepreneurs completed a self-administered questionnaire using field collection, mail, and phone surveying methods. In Turkey, 147 women entrepreneurs completed the questionnaire online and through personal contacts in business organizations.
Findings - The findings indicated a positive relationship of family financial support with business performance of female entrepreneurs in Morocco, a less economically advanced country. However, family moral support is related to better firm performance in Turkey, a more advanced economy. Gender-related personal problems of women entrepreneurs appear to hamper their business performance in Turkey; while in Morocco, the performance of women entrepreneurs seems to improve in the face of such impediments.
Practical implications - The results provide initial evidence that female entrepreneurs benefit from the linkages of family-to-business enrichment in different ways, depending on the country's level of economic development. In less economically developed countries, women entrepreneurs benefit more from instrumental rather than affective components of the enrichment dimension of the BFI. Conversely, in more economically advanced countries, female entrepreneurs benefit more from affective rather than the instrumental elements of this dimension. Likewise, the components of the interference dimension of the BFI affect female entrepreneurs differently depending on the economic development of the countries. Women in the less-developed country of Morocco are less impeded by their personal problems compared to their counterparts in Turkey, a more developed economy. Actually, Moroccan women entrepreneurs improved their business performance when facing obstacles, most likely due to their increased inner strength and resilience acquired when battling adversarial institutional conditions.
Originality/value - The present study makes three unique contributions to the entrepreneurship literature. First, the study links the two BFI dimensions (enrichment and interference) to firm performance with an exclusive focus on female business owners. Second, within the construct of enrichment, the study employs both family instrumental and emotional support. Third, the study shows that the country's level of economic development moderates the relationships between the BFI dimensions and firm performance.

AB  - Web survey respondents are frequently distracted during survey completion, which potentially affects the quality of data they provide. This article reports on results from a laboratory experiment examining how distractions during web survey completion influence data quality. Participants were randomly assigned to experimental groups using a 2 (device type) ? 3 (form of distraction) between-subject factorial design. They were asked to complete a web questionnaire on either a PC or a tablet and were allocated to one of the three distraction conditions: (1) the presence of other people in the room who have a loud conversation, (2) the presence of music, or (3) no distraction. The study examines the effect of distraction on various measures of data quality and attentiveness. While participants felt significantly more distracted in the presence of other people or music, the study found no significant effect of distraction for any of the data quality and attentiveness measures. The findings are encouraging for survey practitioners: Even if web respondents listen to music or are in noisy environments, these forms of distraction generally do not seem to affect the quality of responses they provide.

AB  - Offering participants in mobile app studies personalized feedback on the data they report seems an obvious thing to do: Participants might expect an app to provide feedback given their experiences with commercial apps, feedback might motivate more people to participate in the study, and participants might be more motivated to provide accurate data so that the feedback is more useful to them. However, personalized feedback might lead participants to change the behavior that is being measured with the app, is costly to implement, and also constrains other design decisions for the data collection. In this article, we report on an experimental study that tested the effects of providing personalized feedback in a 1-month mobile app-based spending study. Based on the app paradata and responses to a debrief survey, it seems that participants reacted positively to the feedback. The feedback did not have the potential negative effect of altering the spending participants reported in the app. However, the feedback also did not have the intended effect of increasing initial participation or ongoing adherence to the study protocol.

AB  - This editorial presents rapid advances in imaging technologies which is greatly understate the sheer impact that digital images of all kinds have had in shaping our lives. Digital film and photography, the internet, smartphones, interactive films and installations, digital archives, 3D imaging technologies, CCTV and virtual environments are now part of the quotidian life of many of us living in those parts of the world touched upon by such media. The emergence of cheap and portable digital imaging technologies such as cameras and mobile phones, widespread availability of internet access and broadband connectivity, and the development of easy-to-use online software applications and web-based storage sites have all influenced the uptake of imaging technologies for such activities. Some contributors to this issue share this concern to focus attention on the participatory culture of digital image production. Belonging to networks rather than places and questioning many of the fundamental distinctions through which author conventionally approach images at large, digital images are no longer unilinear products confined to the order of the visible.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Despite a proliferation of applications (apps) to conveniently collect patient-reported outcomes (PROs) from patients, PRO data are yet to be seamlessly integrated with electronic health records (EHRs) in a way that improves interoperability and scalability. We applied the newly created PRO standards from the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology to facilitate the collection and integration of standardized PRO data. A novel multitiered architecture was created to enable seamless integration of PRO data via Substitutable Medical Apps and Reusable Technologies on Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources apps and scaled to different EHR platforms in multiple ambulatory settings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a standards-based approach to deploy 2 apps that source and surface PRO data in real-time for provider use within the EHR and which rely on PRO assessments from an external center to streamline app and EHR integration. RESULTS: The apps were developed to enable patients to answer validated assessments (eg, a Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System including using a Computer Adaptive Test format). Both apps were developed to populate the EHR in real time using the Health Level Seven FHIR standard allowing providers to view patients' data during the clinical encounter. The process of implementing this architecture with 2 different apps across 18 ambulatory care sites and 3 different EHR platforms is described. CONCLUSION: Our approach and solution proved feasible, secure, and time- and resource-efficient. We offer actionable guidance for this technology to be scaled and adapted to promote adoption in diverse ambulatory care settings and across different EHRs.

AB  - Legacy news media have invested substantially in developing digital and mobile news provisioning, alongside the widespread diffusion of information and communication technologies. Amid these developments, many people have shifted the ways they access the news in everyday life, with mobile devices gaining much significance. This has shifted the roles traditionally played by newspapers, television stations, radio broadcasters and news sites, ultimately relating to their democratic functions and the diminishing effect of their business models. This article will describe and explain displacing vis-à-vis complementary effects among age cohorts. It shows how the recent uptake of mobile devices has influenced news consumption via newspapers and news sites. It investigates three research questions, each focusing age cohorts in relation to single-media use, cross-media use, and nonuse. The article presents a statistical analysis of datasets nationally representative to Sweden and the specific case of evening tabloids. The data used originate from scientific omnibus survey projects conducted annually from 1986 to 2012 at the University of Gothenburg. The findings show that the public generally engage in single-media rather than cross-media news consumption, whereas age cohorts have developed divergent forms of single-media use: (a) the 1930s and 1940s age cohort are primarily single-media users in print, (b) the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s age cohorts are computer-oriented single-media users; and (c) the 1980s and 1990s age cohorts are mainly single-media users via mobile devices, but also cross-media users of mobile devices combined with a computer. As of 2012, the uptake of mobile news and cross-media news consumption reached new records, whereas the single-media use of printed newspapers reached a new low. The integrated theoretical framework proves useful for comprehending such transforming news consumption among age cohorts, and reveals the significance for legacy news media to explore and exploit the opportunities arising from mobile devices and tablets.

AB  - During the 1990s news publishers established an online presence and in the 2000s they developed cross-media news work. This has resulted in changing news accessing habits, with varied magnitude among generations. This article aims to construct theoretically sound news media generations, through statistical analysis of data from a nationally representative scientific omnibus survey conducted in 2010. Firstly the article presents a descriptive and explanatory analysis of how eight generational cohorts utilize news in print and/or online and/or mobile. Secondly these findings are used for merging the generational cohorts into a conceptualization involving three media generations. The print generation (1920s- 1940s) shows high probability (70%) and scored its highest value for reading only printed newspaper (Pearson's r = .135). The online generation (1950s-1970s) shows high probability (66%) and scored highest of online only news accessing (Pearson's r = .135). The heterogeneous news usage patterns exhibited by the individualized generation (1980s-1990s) were accommodated for by two cohorts. The online cohort shows high probability for online-only news usage (60%) and a positive correlation (Pearson's r = .065). The cross-media cohort marks high probability for cross-media use (77%) and the highest value for cross-media use (Pearson's r = .141). Adapted from the source document.

AB  - The mitigation hierarchy (MH) is a prominent tool to help businesses achieve no net loss or net gain outcomes for biodiversity. Technological innovations offer benefits for business biodiversity management, yet the range and continued evolution of technologies creates a complex landscape that can be difficult to navigate. Using literature review, online surveys, and semi-structured interviews, we assess technologies that can improve application of the MH. We identify six categories (mobile survey, fixed survey, remote sensing, blockchain, data analysis, and enabling technologies) with high feasibility and/or relevance to (i) aid direct implementation of mitigation measures and (ii) enhance biodiversity surveys and monitoring, which feed into the design of interventions including avoidance and minimization measures. At the interface between development and biodiversity impacts, opportunities lie in businesses investing in technologies, capitalizing on synergies between technology groups, collaborating with conservation organizations to enhance institutional capacity, and developing practical solutions suited for widespread use.

AB  - Objective: To better understand the relationship between online health-seeking behaviors and in-world healthcare utilization (HU) by studies of online search and access activities before and after queries that pursue medical professionals and facilities. Materials and methods We analyzed data collected from logs of online searches gathered from consenting users of a browser toolbar from Microsoft (N=9740). We employed a complementary survey (N=489) to seek a deeper understanding of information-gathering, reflection, and action on the pursuit of professional healthcare. Results: We provide insights about HU through the survey, breaking out its findings by different respondent marginalizations as appropriate. Observations made from search logs may be explained by trends observed in our survey responses, even though the user populations differ. Discussion: The results provide insights about how users decide if and when to utilize healthcare resources, and how online health information seeking transitions to in-world HU. The findings from both the survey and the logs reveal behavioral patterns and suggest a strong relationship between search behavior and HU. Although the diversity of our survey respondents is limited and we cannot be certain that users visited medical facilities, we demonstrate that it may be possible to infer HU from long-term search behavior by the apparent influence that health concerns and professional advice have on search activity. Conclusions: Our findings highlight different phases of online activities around queries pursuing professional healthcare facilities and services. We also show that it may be possible to infer HU from logs without tracking people's physical location, based on the effect of HU on pre- and post-HU search behavior. This allows search providers and others to develop more robust models of interests and preferences by modeling utilization rather than simply the intention to utilize that is expressed in search queries.

The technology is designed to increase the use of exposure therapy by therapists and patients. We begin by outlining the clinical content and design of the application, and then review the clinical administration and theoretical basis for the program. Next, using results from an implementation feasibility study, we illustrate how data collected during application use can inform therapists, supervisors, and researchers about process variables (i.e., use of exposure) and outcomes (i.e., symptom improvement). Implications of the potential for Anxiety Coach to increase access to evidence-based treatment and directions for further research are discussed.

AB  - Folders are a commonplace metaphor in computing environments, constituting a link to physical work materials and are a key means for individuals to impose order on their digital work materials. This paper presents the findings of a novel qualitative study examining folder use by 12 information workers, using logging to accurately capture how folders were used in individual everyday work over 6 weeks, and challenging participants to work without using folders. Through observation and interviews, the study provides new descriptions of how folders are used and the dependence some study participants had on their folders to think and create, as well as to access files. The findings call into question whether search and recency-based lists of files could fulfil the functional role of folders, identified as key means for individuals to construct and specialize their work environments. Implications are discussed for document management tools, and more generally for operating system design.

AB  - Background: While most young people who smoke want to quit, few access cessation support services. Mobile phone-based cessation programs are ideal for young people: mobile phones are the most common means of peer communication, and messages can be delivered in an anonymous manner, anywhere, anytime. Following the success of our text messaging smoking cessation program, we developed an innovative multimedia mobile phone smoking cessation intervention. Objective: The aim of the study was to develop and pilot test a youth-oriented multimedia smoking cessation intervention delivered solely by mobile phone. Methods: Development included creating content and building the technology platform. Content development was overseen by an expert group who advised on youth development principles, observational learning (from social cognitive theory), effective smoking cessation interventions, and social marketing. Young people participated in three content development phases (consultation via focus groups and an online survey, content pre-testing, and selection of role models). Video and text messages were then developed, incorporating the findings from this research. Information technology systems were established to support the delivery of the multimedia messages by mobile phone. A pilot study using an abbreviated 4-week program of video and text content tested the reliability of the systems and the acceptability of the intervention. Results: Approximately 180 young people participated in the consultation phase. There was a high priority placed on music for relaxation (75%) and an interest in interacting with others in the program (40% would read messages, 36% would read a blog). Findings from the pre-testing phase (n = 41) included the importance of selecting "real" and "honest" role models with believable stories, and an interest in animations (37%). Of the 15 participants who took part in the pilot study, 13 (87%) were available for follow-up interviews at 4 weeks: 12 participants liked the program or liked it most of the time and found the role model to be believable; 7 liked the role model video messages (5 were unsure); 8 used the extra assistance for cravings; and 9 were happy with two messages per day. Nine participants (60%) stopped smoking during the program. Some technical challenges were encountered during the pilot study. Conclusions: A multimedia mobile phone smoking cessation program is technically feasible, and the content developed is appropriate for this medium and is acceptable to our target population. These results have informed the design of a 6-month intervention currently being evaluated for its effectiveness in increasing smoking cessation rates in young people. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The internet is a prominent source of health information for the public. This research evaluated both basic use and design tenets and the presence of theoretical components to motivate healthy breast cancer behavior for users of the most frequented breast cancer websites. Methodology: Each website was evaluated with 2 sets of questions. The first attends to the basic use and design tenets of the website. The second coding form assessed the websites use of 3 behavior change theories. Results: The majority of the websites fared well with regards to their use of basic tenet and design principles. Theoretical components were used sparingly on the majority of websites. Discussion: The most frequented breast cancer websites are currently well equipped with basic use and design tenets. However, their lack of behavioral change components is likely to impede users' motivations to protect themselves against breast cancer. © 2008 International Communication Association.

AB  - Digital media technologies provide new opportunities for the recording and publicising of human rights violations. In recent years, soldier photography during military conflicts has become one of the most controversial sources of images of abuse, especially in relation to the visual representation of detainees. The backdrop to this article is the death of Baha Mousa, an Iraqi civilian who died while in detention on a British Army military base in Basra in southern Iraq in 2003. A soldier's video footage of Mr Mousa's treatment in the detention facility has helped to generate a range of cultural, political and legal effects, not least an ongoing official Inquiry into the causes of his death. But while new media technologies, such as mobile camera-phones, can provide an expanded visual record of human suffering and death in war zones, this article argues that this brings dangers as well as possibilities. More generally, it raises questions about how human rights practitioners should respond to the increasing visualisation of witnessing. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Efficient fault detection and characterization are crucial requirements for automated network diagnosis systems. In this paper, we present normalized statistical signatures (NSSs), a network 'soft-failure' characterization technique for user devices (UDs) based upon exhaustive sets of aggregated statistical features extracted from transmission control protocol (TCP) packet streams. TCP streams are collected on-demand (e.g. upon user complaint) with fixed data transfer limits to capture the artifacts resulting from UD faults. NSSs created using live network and testbed data are able to uniquely characterize many faults and offer insight into how various types of features are affected by the faults and networks. We then introduce the link adaptive signature estimation (LASE) technique to reduce the quantities of collected NSSs required for generalized diagnostic systems with variable link parameters. We create feature estimator functions using multivariate regression techniques to generate artificial NSSs, which are subsequently used to train machine learning systems that have robust generalization capabilities. Performance of a prototype fault classifier system based on NSSs shows that an overall detection accuracy of 98% can be achieved for eight types of faults in a live network environment. In this paper, we specifically focus on formulating the basic framework of NSS and LASE, and limit the analysis to wired networks. This work can later be extended to encompass more complex fixed and mobile wireless networking environments. We expect that the combination of NSSs and LASE can serve as the foundation of next-generation automated network diagnosis systems. © 2013 The British Computer Society 2013.

AB  - Most discussions on the digital divide have predominantly focused on social disparities in the physical accessibility of information and communication technologies (ICT), and the proposed solutions are related to providing low cost access to the underprivileged. The mobile phone has been considered as a good solution due to its relatively low cost. This paper, based on an empirical study in Sri Lanka, demonstrates that even though the underprivileged population has adopted the mobile phone, most of the computer based communication facilities available in the phones are 'inaccessible' to such users due the objectification of broader social inequalities in the design of phones. In other words, the digital divide is objectified in the design. © 2014 International Communication Association.

AB  - This article highlights the necessity of considering socio-cultural values and attitudes when designing digital media, through presenting a study that explores parental attitudes toward play and digital media in childhood. Here we present a study examining the effectiveness of a mobile application designed to encourage real-world play between parents and their children (aged three to five years old). A series of quasi-naturalistic play spaces were created in child-centric organisations with parents visiting these organisations invited to use the play space—including tablet devices loaded with the application. Surveys—including open and closed questions—were collected from 28 parents along with observational data focusing on parent–child–screen interactions. The research highlights a tension between the physicality and preconceptions of digital devices and parent–child play. We also note the mobilisation of the notion ‘quality time’ as somewhat antithetical to digital play—indeed, expectations of digital devices in childhood, alongside a presumed developmental purpose of certain forms of play, impacted the capacity of this application to facilitate real-world play. These findings and resulting methodological discussion have implications for both the design of mobile applications and future research. Moreover, this article highlights some of the values and assumptions that influence parental expectations of purposing play and digital media.

AB  - Background: Patients with single-sided deafness (SSD), where one ear has an unaidable hearing loss and the other ear has normal or aidable hearing, often complain of difficulties understanding speech and localizing sound sources, and report a higher self-perceived hearing disability. Patients with SSD may benefit from using contralateral routing of signal (CROS) or bilateral contralateral routing of the signal (BiCROS) amplification. Dissatisfaction of previously available (Bi)CROS devices has been reported, such as, interfering transmissions, low-fidelity sound quality, poor 'user-friendly' set-up, and a bulky and cosmetically cumbersome appearance. Purpose: Recent advances in hearing aid technology have improved (Bi)CROS hearing aids; however, these devices have not been experimentally evaluated. We hypothesized that newer technology with reports of improved digital signal processing, wireless transmission, and physical design would be as good, or better than, our participants' previous-generation BiCROS systems. Research Design: A within-subjects, pretest-posttest design was executed. Study Sample: Thirty-nine veterans (one female, 38 males; mean age = 74 yr, range = 49-85 yr) from the Audiology Section of the Bay Pines Veterans Affair Healthcare System participated. All participants were previously experienced BiCROS hearing aid users with varying degrees of sensorinerual hearing impairment in their better ear. Intervention: Participants were provided at least 4 wk of consistent use with the new BiCROS. Data Collection and Analysis: Participants completed three research visits. At Visit 1, with their previous BiCROS, and at Visit 3, with their new BiCROS, the following objective and subjective measures were obtained: (1) soundfield speech-in-noise testing using the Words-In-Noise (WIN) test; (2) speech, spatial, and qualities of the hearing scale (SSQ) questionnaire; (3) selected questions from the MarkeTrak questionnaire; and, (4) three open-ended questions. Data were analyzed using parametric and nonparametric statistics. Results: Overall, the objective (WIN) and subjective (SSQ, MarkeTrak, and open-ended questions) measures indicated that the new BiCROS provided better outcomes than the previous BiCROS system. In addition, an overlap of favorable results was seen across measures. Conclusions: Of the 39 participants, 95% reported improvements with the new BiCROS and chose to utilize the device regularly. The favorable objective and subjective outcomes indicate that the new BiCROS system is as good, or better than, what was previously utilized by our sample of veterans.

AB  - Online fraud is the most prevalent acquisitive crime in Europe. This study applies routine activities theory to a subset of online fraud, online identity theft, by exploring country-level mechanisms, in addition to individual determinants via a multi-level analysis of Eurobarometer survey data. This paper adds to the theory of cybercrime and policy debates by: (1) showing that country physical guardianship (e.g. cyber security strategy) moderates the effects of individual physical guardianship; (2) introducing a typology of online capable guardianship: passive physical, active personal and avoidance personal guardianship; (3) showing that online identity theft is associated with personal and physical guardianship; and (4) identifying public Internet access and online auction selling as highly risky routine activities. The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of studying country-level effects on online identity theft victimization.

AB  - Whether the public sector continues to offer African Americans an upwardly mobile "occupational niche" is unclear, especially in the face of contemporary reforms that run counter to workplace protections. In this article, and drawing on overtime data from Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we explore this question with a specific focus on the upward mobility of men into white-collar occupations. Findings suggest that the reform period of 2005-2010, characterized by increased employer discretion and an application of a "business model" to public sector work, undermined African American relative to White promotion prospects. What was once greater racial parity in the incidence, determinants, and timing of upward mobility during the pre-reform period (1985-1990) eroded during the reform period (2005-2010). Promotion-centered inequalities in the private sector, in contrast, while high, were more or less constant across the same time period. We conclude by discussing escalating public sector racial disadvantages, the processes undergirding them, and their implications for the likely contraction of the African American middle class.

AB  - Loneliness is a prevalent phenomenon within the older adult population. Previous literature suggests that technology use, specifically internet use, can alleviate loneliness and improve wellbeing. This research study follows 32 people over the age of 65 using a digital technology for six months. A mixed-method approach was used to collect quantitative and qualitative data throughout the time period. The repeated questionnaire measured changes in frequency of use, emotional attachment towards a device, a sense of belonging and perceptions of self-worth, whilst an event-based diary was used to note usages and influences of technology on lifestyle. Results revealed positive relationships between frequency of use and emotional attachment and frequency of use and perceptions of self-worth. There was no significant relationship between frequency of use and a sense of belonging for the aggregate data. There was, however, a negative relationship between emotional attachment towards a device and a sense of belonging, suggesting a fine balance between technology use to improve self-esteem through connections with social networks and an over-dependence on technology that can actually reduce feelings of belonging.

AB  - The music industry in the 21st century uses digital technology in a wide range of applications including performance, composition and in recording and publishing. Much of this digital technology is freely available via downloads from the internet, as part of software included with computers when they are purchased and via applications that are available for some mobile phones. Such technology is transforming music and the way people approach many traditional music activities. This paper is about transformative practices that are underway in some secondary school music classrooms. Practices are being shaped by the culture of the schools and the students that they recruit. We describe the perceptions and practices of nine music teachers in four New Zealand secondary schools with regard to digital technology and how they are changing their work in their classroom. Data collection techniques include interviews, observation and a questionnaire. The data were subjected to two stages of thematic analysis. Grounded analysis was used to allow the teachers' voices emerge. This was then followed by the application of five themes identified in the literature on pedagogic change prompted by teachers' adoption of digital technologies.

AB  - Virtual environments enable residents to craft unique digital representations of self and to establish virtual identities that may or may not resemble physical-world identities. How might this process be different for musicians who share music as their personal product and establish regular interaction with a fan base over time? This study is presented as a co-constructed, multi-vocal narrative of the researcher's experience as Flameheart Sol, live music venue owner in Second Life, representing the interplay of real and crafted identities of 7 virtually performing musicians. Using theories of normal psychosocial development (Erikson) and subject-object orientation (Kegan), the author addresses: (a) what processes contribute to the crafting of a virtual identity and (b) how the real life of the individual changes over time through the interplay of virtual and physical identities. These questions uncover the participant's cultural footprint -- the accumulated culture and experiences that comprise the participant's identity before entering Second Life. The study then looks at the point at which an avatar representation of the participant is crafted, creating a symbolic device that enables the participant to shift from the "real" (in terms of being physical) to the "virtual" (lived experiences as an embodied avatar persona). It is through these virtually lived experiences, where the constant interaction demanded of virtual worlds creates an immediate feedback system, that an alternate, situated identity is developed. This avatar identity is no less "real" in terms of its reflecting aspects of the identity of the individual but reflects the unique affordances of a user-created space that is limited only by his or her imagination. Through personal interviews and concert observations (in both the virtual and physical worlds), it was possible not only to determine what influenced the virtual identity of the subject, but also to observe the level of "embeddedness," as described by Kegan; how emotionally invested the subjects were toward their avatar persona. This embeddedness included identity coupling, identity transparency, and shared experiences with a fan base. Subjects also experienced changes to their real lives in increased music creativity, a voice for passionate causes, and a responsive global audience that offered real income.

AB  - Background: Attrition is a persistent issue in online self-help programs, but limited research is available on reasons for attrition or successful methods for improving participant retention. One potential approach to understanding attrition and retention in such programs is to examine person-related variables (eg, beliefs and attitudes) that influence behavior. Theoretical models, such as the Theory of Planned Behavior, that describe conditions influencing human behavior may provide a useful framework for predicting participant retention in online-based program. Objective: We examined predictors of participant retention in a guided online anxiety, depression, and stress self-help program for university students using the theory of planned behavior. We also explored whether age, symptom severity, and type of coaching (ie, email vs phone) affected participant retention. Methods: 65 university students with mild to moderate depression, anxiety, and stress were enrolled in this prospective cohort study. Participants completed a questionnaire based on the theory of planned behavior prior to commencing the online-based program and the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) during the assessment module of the program. Participant retention was operationalized as the number of program modules completed. Results: Perceived control over completing the online program significantly predicted intention to complete the program (F3,62 = 6.7; P = .001; adjusted R²=.2; standardized beta = .436, P = .001). Age (standardized beta = .319, P = .03) and perceived behavioral control (standardized beta = .295, P = .05) predicted the number of program modules completed (F3,61 = 3.20, P = .03, adjusted R₂ = .11). Initial level of distress (ie, symptom severity) did not predict participant retention (P = .55). Participants who chose phone-based coaching completed more program modules than participants who chose email-based coaching (Mann-Whitney’s U = 137; P = .004). Conclusions: Participants’ age, level of perceived behavioral control, and choice of interaction (ie, phone-based or email-based coaching) were found to influence retention in this online-based program.

AB  - Consumers are increasingly using technologies such as wearables or mobile apps to achieve their self-improvement goals. Such technologies often contain features that enable social interdependence (competition or cooperation) among users to support them in improving their engagement, performance, and well-being (life satisfaction and personal growth). However, the critical question remains: does competition or cooperation best serve users in attaining these self-improvement goals? Evidence from an online experiment and a field study reveals that competition is more effective in driving performance and personal growth, while cooperation is superior in terms of behavioral engagement and life satisfaction. Furthermore, the results indicate that the effects are mediated by strive for success and fear of failure, two counteracting psychological processes. While competition is the stronger trigger for both pathways, downstream effects vary depending on the self-improvement goal considered. This research thus provides insights into whether and how users can best realize their self-improvement goals using technologies that include social features. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Mobile devices allow users to keep ubiquitously connected to the internet. Consequently, they change the reception of information by faster access, greater timeliness, and new media usage contexts. At the same time, many traditional media organizations already produce content for mobile websites and apps in line with cross-media strategies. Reflecting severe structural changes in the journalism market, they are hoping to manage the digital transition successfully by mobile publishing, (re) gaining especially the digital natives. Referring to the media repertoire approach, we examine the role of mobile devices on two different levels. First, from a technical point of view, we consider the platform repertoire of mobile internet users for information. Focusing on the use frequency of online (computer, mobile devices) and offline media (printed newspaper, television set, radio set), a quantitative study (N = 498, face-to-face interviews) reveals six different user types. Second, we examine the new medium's use for information purposes by drawing on the unique specifics of mobile devices compared to other media. Results show that the new medium is frequently used for information due to its particular qualities. Third, we look at the users' selected mobile news sources from an institutional perspective. Our results indicate that, although new online-only providers are of a certain relevance to mobile internet users, traditional journalism's content dominates the mobile information repertoire.

AB  - Objective: An evaluation of Internet end-to-end performance was conducted for the purpose of better understanding the overall performance of Internet pathways typical of those used to access information in National Library of Medicine (NLM) databases and, by extension, other Internet-based biomedical information resources. Design: The evaluation used a three-level test strategy: 1) user testing to collect empirical data on Internet performance as perceived by users when accessing NLM Web-based databases, 2) technical testing to analyze the Internet paths between the NLM and the user's desktop computer terminal, and 3) technical testing between the NLM and the World Wide Web ('Web') server computer at the user's institution to help characterize the relative performance of Internet pathways. Measurements: Time to download the front pages of NLM Web sites and conduct standardized searches of NLM databases, data transmission capacity between NLM and remote locations (known as the bulk transfer capacity [BTC]), 'ping' round-trip time as an indication of the latency of the network pathways, and the network routing of the data transmissions (number and sequencing of hops). Results: Based on 347 user tests spread over 16 locations, the median time per location to download the main NLM home page ranged from 2 to 59 seconds, and 1 to 24 seconds for the other NLM Web sites tested. The median time to conduct standardized searches and get search results ranged from 2 to 14 seconds for PubMed and 4 to 18 seconds for Internet Grateful Med. The overall problem rate was about 1 percent; that is, on the average, users experienced a problem once every 100 test measurements. The user terminal tests at five locations and Web host tests at 13 locations provided profiles of BTC, RTT, and network routing for both dial-up and fixed Internet connections. Conclusion: The evaluation framework provided a profile of typical Internet performance and insights into network performance and time- of-day/day-of-week variability. This profile should serve as a frame of reference to help identify and diagnose connectivity problems and should contribute to the evolving concept of Internet quality of service.

AB  - As mobile devices have become increasingly commonplace, concerns have been raised by the media about the use of such technology by children and young people. Some media coverage has included concerns about children not getting enough sleep due to late night phone use and even the dangers associated with inattention when crossing roads. However, the primary concern has centered on the impact that the growing use of text messaging could have on language itself and children’s language development in particular. For example, suggestions have been made that the use of abbreviations and alternative spellings, which are a feature of communication via text and instant messaging, ultimately pose a threat to children’s spelling and grammatical development. Such assertions have not been made tentatively; rather, they have been asserted as inevitable truths, despite the lack of evidence at the time to support such strong claims. However, our own work and that of others working in this field have not supported these concerns and have in fact either shown positive or null associations between the use of texting slang and literacy development. The question of why there has been little evidence of any detrimental impact is one that we have explored in our papers. However, there is scope to understand further the findings we obtained in these studies if we consider the proposition that the linguistic forms that many children use when writing in digital contexts represent a type of 'efficient' orthographic system.

AB  - Shared parent-child experiences while engaged with an iPadTM were examined to determine if and then how parents interact with their children when using mobile digital devices. In total, 104 parent-child dyads participated in an observation session where parent-child interactions using the touchscreen tablet device were video recorded in order to observe first-hand the supports and exchanges between parent and child (age range 46.21-75.9 months). Results indicate that parents provide a great deal of support to their children while interacting with the touchscreen tablet device including verbal, emotional-verbal, physical and emotional -physical supports. The types of support offered did not differ as a function of parent gender or experience with mobile devices (users versus non -users). Overall, parents rated their own experience engaging with the touchscreen tablet and that of their child's positively. Additional survey measures assessed parents' perceptions of their child's technology use and attitudes regarding optimal ages and conditions for introducing and using technology. Most parents indicated a preference for very early introduction to mobile technologies. Implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - In this article, we report on an action case study on the use of mobile-assisted peer feedback to improve second language (L2) speakers? English performance. Drawing on the learning-oriented assessment (LOA) framework (Carless, 2007), the study made in-class use of a newly developed mobile app with the provision of peer feedback. The study was conducted with 25 Business School students in an English for Specific Purposes course at a Hong Kong university. A mixed-methods approach was adopted, including a questionnaire survey, a focus group discussion after the class and a teacher journal. In addition to the participants? general attitudes, two broad themes were found in relation to the participants? learning experience, namely the use of peer feedback and the affordances and constraints of technology. Results showed that students generally agreed on the positive effects of mobile-assisted peer feedback (e.g. real-time and anonymous feedback), while they recognized some limitations such as the small screen size of their phones and the limited number of given rubrics. Finally, we discuss the implications from different perspectives based on the reported themes.

AB  - Nowadays the web map (E-map) is an indispensable wayfinding tool in the Internet-based society. However, its usability will vary with a different navigational technique or input device. The navigational techniques currently adopted by various web maps were investigated and analyzed. Moreover, two input devices, i.e., the mouse and the touch screen, were operated in four navigational techniques to study the differences in their functions and performances. Later, the research findings were utilized to develop a new navigational technique. The research was divided into two stages. During the first stage, all the navigational techniques in current use were investigated and compared. Then, based on the results of analysis, the enhanced navigator with continuous control (ENCC) was designed. During the second stage, the searching and browsing techniques of different web maps were simulated. Afterwards, the mouse and the touch screen were employed separately to conduct simulation tests in the following navigational techniques: (1) combined panning buttons (CPB), (2) distributed panning buttons (DPB), (3) ENCC, and (4) G&D. A total of 36 participants took part in the trials. At the end of the experiment, the operational performances of the participants were studied through the two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA); besides, the subjective evaluation questionnaires were answered. It was discovered that the mouse did better than the touch screen in the four navigational techniques. Besides, among the four techniques, ENCC showed the best performance. Capable of continuous control and continuous display, the ENCC interface was upgraded in terms of operational speed and directional control. The findings can be used as a reference in the design of web maps. Also, it is suggested that ENCC should be widely applied to touch screens and mice so that the navigation of information space may be facilitated.

AB  - Cloud storage services have been rapidly gaining popularity among Internet/Mobile users. Prior studies largely focused on users' early adoption of cloud storage services, continual usage of the services and users' willingness to pay. However, limited attention has been paid to switching behaviors. In the Chinese market, as services provided by different platforms become homogeneous, non-functional factors are expected to play an important role in affecting users' selection of services. Based on the push-pull mooring framework, we propose a research model by incorporating four factors: risk, trust, switching cost and social influences (critical mass and social norm). Results from a field survey suggest that all push (risk), pull (trust, critical mass) and mooring (switching cost, social norm) factors each have direct impacts on switching intention. Mooring factors fail to moderate the impact of push factor on switching intention, but they are able to moderate the effects of pull factors on switching intention. The results yield both theoretical and practical implications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study employs an integrated approach based on the technology acceptance model (TAM) to examine online experience by combining design features and social factors. It also explores the interrelationships between online experience and smartphone users' destination image. A pretest was conducted to examine the internal construct structure through exploratory factor analysis. In the main field test, a survey company distributed online questionnaires to recruited smartphone users. Confirmatory factor analysis was employed to confirm reliability and validity, and a structural equation modeling test with maximum likelihood estimation was performed to identify the relationships among the constructs. The results suggest that perceived usefulness and ease of use are important factors that enhanced users' online experience with smartphone applications. Positive relationships exist between users' online experiences and cognitive and affective image. Furthermore, both of these factors positively contribute to overall destination image. This study contributes to the extant literature by identifying the momentous impact of mobile technology on destination image formation, and a new perspective of extending the TAM by measuring users' online experience of smartphone applications is provided for the future studies. Marketing implications and limitations are discussed.

AB  - The rise of increasingly more powerful chatbots offers a new way to collect information through conversational surveys, where a chatbot asks open-ended questions, interprets a user's free-text responses, and probes answers whenever needed. To investigate the effectiveness and limitations of such a chatbot in conducting surveys, we conducted a field study involving about 600 participants. In this study with mostly open-ended questions, half of the participants took a typical online survey on Qualtrics and the other half interacted with an AI-powered chatbot to complete a conversational survey. Our detailed analysis of over 5,200 free-text responses revealed that the chatbot drove a significantly higher level of participant engagement and elicited significantly better quality responses measured by Gricean Maxims in terms of their informativeness, relevance, specificity, and clarity. Based on our results, we discuss design implications for creating AI-powered chatbots to conduct effective surveys and beyond.

AB  - Individual actions are both constrained and facilitated by the social context in which individuals are embedded. But research to test specific hypotheses about the role of space on human behaviors and well-being is limited by the difficulty of collecting accurate and personally relevant social context data. We report on a project in Chitwan, Nepal, that directly addresses challenges to collect accurate activity space data. We test if a computer assisted interviewing (CAI) tablet-based approach to collecting activity space data was more accurate than a paper map-based approach; we also examine which subgroups of respondents provided more accurate data with the tablet mode compared to paper. Results show that the tablet approach yielded more accurate data when comparing respondent-indicated locations to the known locations as verified by on-the-ground staff. In addition, the accuracy of the data provided by older and less healthy respondents benefited more from the tablet mode.

AB  - Highlights • We study the role of messaging apps in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. • Messaging app use for news is negatively related to factual political knowledge. • Messaging app use for news is positively related to miscalibration of knowledge. • Messaging app use for news is positively related to political participation. • Miscalibration of knowledge is positively related to political participation. Abstract Mobile messaging apps, such as Snapchat, Facebook Messenger, and WhatsApp, were unique campaign and information platforms in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. This study assesses how using such apps for campaign information is related to political knowledge and participation. Data from an online survey conducted prior to the election indicate that using messaging apps for news is positively related to knowledge miscalibration. Knowledge miscalibration is positively related to offline and online political participation. Findings are discussed in terms of the role of messaging apps in the political process.

AB  - Mobile applications are software packages that can be installed and executed in a mobile device. Which mobile application is trustworthy for a user to purchase, download, install, execute or recommend becomes a crucial issue that impacts its final success. This paper proposes TruBeRepec, a trust-behavior-based reputation and recommender system for mobile applications. We explore a model of trust behavior for mobile applications based on the result of a large-scale user survey. We further develop a number of algorithms that are used to evaluate individual user's trust in a mobile application through trust behavior observation, generate the application's reputation by aggregating individual trust and provide application recommendations based on the correlation of trust behaviors. We show the practical significance of TruBeRepec through simulations and analysis with regard to effectiveness, robustness, and usability, as well as privacy.

AB  - This longitudinal study examined the reciprocal relationship between parental active mediation, parent-child relationships, and children's problematic mobile phone use (PMPU). A sample of 258 primary school students in Beijing, China, completed self-report questionnaires at three time points, with a one-semester interval (a six-month gap) between each measurement wave. The cross-lagged model test results revealed that parental active mediation may help reduce children's PMPU, whereas the corresponding reverse path from PMPU to parental active mediation was nonsignificant. There was a reciprocal negative relationship between parent-child relationships and children's PMPU. Parental active mediation had a positive effect on parent-child relationships, yet the corresponding reverse path from parent-child relationships to parental active mediation was nonsignificant. Overall, this study described a dynamic picture of children's PMPU, suggesting both a parent-driven process and a child-driven process in the prediction of children's PMPU. Our findings provide theoretical and practical implications to prevent or reduce children's engagement in PMPU.

AB  - This study proposes an integrated technology acceptance model to investigate the factors that affect drivers' usage intention of mobile navigation applications. The proposed model adds three new constructs (drivers' sense of direction, navigation application affinity and distraction perception) to the original technology acceptance model based on the features of mobile navigation applications. First, a questionnaire was developed and ad-ministered, and data from 384 drivers were collected via an online survey. Second, confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to examine the reliability and validity of the developed scale based on the collected data. Third, a structural equation model was constructed to investigate the interrelationships among these constructs in the conceptual research model and to identify the key factors that affect drivers' acceptance of mobile navigation applications. The proposed model explained 60.50% of the variance in the intention to use mobile navigation applications. In addition to attitude and perceived usefulness, navigation application affinity and distraction perception also significantly affected drivers' intention to use mobile navigation applications. Navigation application affinity and distraction perception affected not only drivers' intention to use but also their perceptions. Sense of direction was a significant individual trait that affected drivers' navigation application affinity, distraction perception, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. These findings imply that relevant developers should continually optimize the incorrect and inappropriate use of navigation information and that they should attach importance to the amount and intelligibility of navigation information. Furthermore, the prompt form of navigation information should satisfy the demands and expectations of drivers with different senses of direction. Overall, this study improves our understanding of drivers' acceptance of mobile navigation applications and provides some important practical implications to improve mobile navigation services.

AB  - Purpose Technology has dramatically changed the nature of interorganizational relationships and the ways partners interact with each other. In the new platform business model, platform technology usage seems to work as a governance mechanism to regulate operations and manage platform builder-platform participant relationships. To respond to these changes, this study aims to examine how platform technology usage in platform operations influenced the relationship quality between the platform builder and platform participants by promoting perceptions of three types of justice (procedural, distributive and informational). Design/methodology/approach The authors propose that it is through the perception of three types of justice (procedural, distributive and informational) that platform technology usage exerts its governance effect on the platform relationship. In doing this, the authors seek to answer the following two related research questions in the platform setting: How does platform technology usage drive relationship performance via different types of justice perceptions? Which type of justice affects relationship performance most effectively? Findings The results from a survey of 384 participant firms from two of the largest digital platforms for mobile/PC application in China reveal that platform technology usage leads to better relationship performance through enhanced perceptions of procedural, distributive, and informational justice. The positive impacts of procedural justice and distributive justice on relationship performance are greater than that of informational justice, while the impacts of procedural justice and distributive justice show no significant differences. Originality/value These findings provide novel insights into the role and mechanisms of platform technology usage in platform relationship management.

AB  - Streaming media devices have recently become one of the innovative IT devices used to replace traditional smart TV sets. In order to examine user acceptance of streaming media device, this study proposes an extended research model based upon flow theory and investigates the relationship among flow, perceived usefulness, product-related characteristics (i.e., content quality, functionality, ease of use, portability), and a manufacturer-related characteristic (i.e., trust). Partial least square methodology was employed to test the proposed model and corresponding hypotheses on data collected from 305 survey samples. The results showed that flow and perceived usefulness, two mediating variables, has a significant influence on usage intention. Among the four antecedents reflecting product-related attributes, content quality has the strongest effect on flow. Interestingly, functionality and ease of use affected only perceived usefulness in an indirect way through flow. Thus, flow mediates the effect of functionality and ease of use on perceived usefulness. This study discusses a number of implications and offers insights useful for both researchers and practitioners.

AB  - Multitasking on digital devices during social interactions has become increasingly common, but research on this behavior is far from thorough. Expanding on literature of phubbing and technoference, the authors proposed a theoretical framework, digital social multitasking, defined as performing technology-based multitasking during a social interaction, to study the behavior. This mixed-methods study focused on one type of digital social multitasking: phone use during a face-to-face interaction with a friend. Self-report survey data were collected from 222 college students (Mage = 19.87; 82% female; 45% Black or African American, 43% White or European American). Results showed that digital social multitasking mostly took place when the face-to-face interaction was casual, and the majority of the phone-based activities were shared between the participant and the friend. Participants did not hold a negative view of their own or friend’s digital social multitasking, but when they saw their own multitasking as distracting or friend’s multitasking as dismissive, they reported lower friendship quality and higher loneliness. The level of one’s own and friend’s multitasking did not directly associate with friendship quality and loneliness; they only indirectly associated with the well-being outcomes via negative perception of the behavior. Friend’s digital social multitasking had stronger associations with poor socioemotional well-being when the face-to-face interactions were serious in nature. Overall, the socioemotional implications of college emerging adults’ phone use during peer interactions did not seem as alarming as what many may have believed, and the implications were contingent upon the context of the behavior.

AB  - Despite mobile government microblogging service (GMS) initially attracted a huge number of followers, its discontinuance rate remains high. How to lead citizens to continue use mobile GMS is a question that many government agencies are asking. The present study attempts to understand the factors that affect mobile GMS continuance by focusing on the influences of perceived integration and perceived interactivity on citizens’ value evaluations. The research model was empirically tested against data collected from 619 mobile GMS users in China. The results of structural equation modeling analysis shown that perceived (online-offline) integration and perceived (citizen-government) interactivity positively affect both two extrinsic values (information value and social value), and two intrinsic values (hedonic value and emotional value) of using mobile GMS. Information value, social value, and hedonic value in turn further positively affect mobile GMS continuance. However, the influence of emotional value on mobile GMS continuance was not significant. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are also presented. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Nowadays, the idea of media contents streaming through the Internet has become a very important issue. On the other hand, full caching for media objects is not a practical solution and leads to consume the cache storage in keeping few media objects because of its limited capacity. Furthermore, repeated traffic which is being sent to clients wastes the network bandwidth. Thus, utilizing the bandwidth of the network is considered as an important objective for network administrators. Media objects have some characteristics that have to be considered when a caching algorithm is going to be performed. In this paper, recent approaches that have been proposed for media streams caching in peer-to-peer systems are reviewed. © 2013 The British Computer Society 2013. All rights reserved.

AB  - Along with the growing popularity of e-government, public agencies increasingly have technology options in providing services to citizens, including mobile phone and web-based applications, information kiosks, and smart cards among others. Whether citizens will embrace these new technologies that are used in the delivery of public service and information has been a question both in academia and practice. On the other hand, the determinants of acceptance have not been well understood. Accordingly, this study aims to answer two main research questions: 1) What are the individual, social, technological, and contextual factors that affect citizens' adoption of new technologies used in e-government context? 2) Are adoption factors similar for different technologies? The study examines citizens' adoption of three different technologies in using public transportation service. Two of these technologies, Chicago Card and Chicago Card plus, are transaction technologies in the form of a smart card. The third technology, Chicago Transit Authority website, is used both as an information and transaction technology. Using data from Chicago Transit Authority Customer Experience Survey conducted in year 2008, the study tested a model of citizens' technology adoption in e-government context. The study finds that individual characteristics such as lifestyle and intensity of public service use, technology usage context such as availability of other advantageous options and presence of incentives for technology use, and presence of facilitating conditions such as availability of resources, skills, and self-efficacy matter for citizens' technology adoption in e-government context, but the extent to which they are important may depend on the characteristics of the technologies, such as complexity, cost, features, and benefits. In addition, the findings from exploratory analyses indicate that adoption factors also differed for men and women within a single technology. Findings also imply that when public agencies offer a variety of technologies with different levels of complexity, benefits, and costs according to the characteristics of different market segments using their services, they may be in a better position to address digital disparities, and provide a more equitable distribution of benefits by including a diversity of people that can take advantage of the technology.

AB  - User participation is increasingly being seen as a way to mitigate the challenges that firms face in innovation, such as high costs and uncertainty of customer acceptance of their innovations. Thus, firms are establishing online platforms to support users in innovating services, such as iOS and Android platforms for mobile data service (MDS) innovation. Mobile phone platforms are characterized by technology (toolkits) and policy (rules) components that could influence user's innovation. Additionally, attributes of user innovators (lead userness) are expected to drive their innovation behavior. Yet it is unclear how these characteristics jointly impact users' service innovation outcomes. To address this knowledge gap, we propose a model that builds on user innovation theory and the work design literature to explain the influences of lead userness, design autonomy, toolkit support, and their interactions on user's innovation outcomes (innovation quantity) on these platforms. We conceptualize toolkit support in terms of two constructs (i.e., ease of effort and exploration), and design autonomy in terms of three constructs (i.e., decision-making autonomy, scheduling autonomy, and work-method autonomy). The model was tested using survey and archival data from two dominant mobile phone platforms (i.e., iOS and Android). As hypothesized, lead userness, exploration through toolkits, and ease of effort through toolkits positively affect users' innovation quantity. Additionally, decision-making autonomy and work-method autonomy influence innovation quantity, but scheduling autonomy does not. Further, the proposed three-way interactions between lead userness, toolkit support, and design autonomy constructs on users' quantity of MDS innovation are largely supported. The findings enhance our understanding of user innovation on mobile phone platforms.

AB  - Purpose - Mobile commerce (m-commerce) represents a new area of business opportunity. Past research has often focused on customer acceptance and its antecedents, rather than factors that build trust in m-commerce. The purpose of this paper is to provide an explanation of factors influencing customer trust towards vendors on the mobile internet.
Design/methodology/approach - M-commerce relies on mobile technology and well-maintained service quality. This paper has applied the service quality model (SERVQUAL) and technology acceptance model (TAM), coupled with proposed quality factors in relation to m-commerce that, according to the literature, influence customer trust, to empirically test the formation of trust. The proposed model was empirically evaluated using online survey data from 212 experienced m-commerce customers.
Findings - The results showed that despite customisation, brand image and satisfaction all directly affecting customer trust towards the vendor in m-commerce, customisation and brand image equally had a stronger direct effect on trust formation. In addition, interactivity and responsiveness had no direct impact, but had an indirect impact via satisfaction on trust towards the vendor.
Practical implications - This paper contributes a theoretical understanding of factors that activate the development of trust towards the vendor. For vendors in general the results enable them to better develop customer trust in m-commerce.
Originality/value - The paper verifies the effects of satisfaction and proposed quality factors on customer confidence in m-commerce. Moreover, this article validates the determinants of satisfaction.

AB  - How do digital communicative spaces facilitate legal mobilization, an emerging genre of social activism in China? What strategies do activists pursue in these spaces to sustain their resistance? Using a 2015 case study in Xiamen, Fujian Province, where an environmental nongovernmental organization led a lawsuit in the name of "pedestrians' rights," I seek to address these questions. This exploratory research illustrates how activists appropriate a "matrix of free spaces" available to them-a hybridized intersection of relatively stable organizational and digital spaces-for everyday organizing and for disseminating "citizenship talk," so that participants mobilize as citizens who invoke the law to effect policy change. It also reveals a snapshot of how collective solidarities may persist under authoritarian rule as well as the broader possibilities and challenges accompanying civic activism in China.

AB  - This study measured arousal responses to multitasking by recording switches between content on personal computers over a day. Results showed that switches occurred every 19seconds, more often than has been reported in previous research. Arousal was highest at the point of a switch with declines in skin conductance afterward. Switches were also preceded by a 12-second period of increasing skin conductance. 2 new methods were used, one an original application that recorded screen shots, and another that measured changes in skin conductance during the day using a wrist sensor. Results are discussed in light of increasing use of single devices displaying multiple types of content, rather than multitasking that occurs when attention is divided between content on multiple devices. © 2014 International Communication Association.

AB  - This study examined which accompanying information elements were noticed by visitors while they were looking at artworks, using eye-tracking experiments. First, we conducted an online survey to grasp the types of information that visitors wanted to know, and five elements were obtained. Second, we collected information on these five elements through interviews with one artist. Third, eye-tracking experiments were performed with semi-structured interviews. We set the information delivery media as follows: wall and mobile texts as commonly used in art museums. The results showed that patterns of eye movement of visitors were different according to the information delivery media. Also, we found that there was a correlation between the results of the eye-tracking experiment and visitor interest. This study has limitations in that it is an experiment limited to small sample size and artwork genre; however, it is meaningful in that it was able to grasp the information needs of visitors through eye-tracking.

AB  - This article evaluates the usability of motion sensing-based interaction on a mobile platform using image browsing as a representative task. Three types of interfaces, a physical button interface, a motion-sensing interface using a high-precision commercial 3D motion tracker, and a motion-sensing interface using an in-house low-cost 3D motion tracker, are compared in terms of task performance and subjective preference. Participants were provided with prolonged training over 20 days, in order to compensate for the participants' unfamiliarity with the motion-sensing interfaces. Experimental results showed that the participants' task performance and subjective preference for the two motion-sensing interfaces were initially low, but they rapidly improved with training and soon approached the level of the button interface. Furthermore, a recall test, which was conducted 4 weeks later, demonstrated that the usability gains were well retained in spite of the long time gap between uses. Overall, these findings highlight the potential of motion-based interaction as an intuitive interface for mobile devices. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore the effects of different acupuncture insertion velocities. Design: This study was performed as a within-subject design to control for individual differences. The biomechanical properties of needle insertion and accompanying subjective acupuncture perception was compared between different insertion velocities. Setting: The setting for this study was the laboratory of acupuncture meridian and functional neurology, Acupuncture and Meridian Science Research Center, Kyung Hee University. Subjects: Sixteen (16) healthy volunteers participated in the study. Intervention: An acupuncture needle was inserted to the acupoint LI4 by an acupuncture needle insertion device (ANI-KY) at high or low speed of needle insertion. Outcome measures: Biomechanical properties such as force and depth were measured online by sensors equipped with the ANI-KY device. Participants filled out a questionnaire about acupuncture sensation or perception. Results: Acupuncture needle insertion at a higher velocity was linked with higher maximum power, lower level of pain, and de qi–like perceptions such as 'compressing' and 'heavy' ( p < 0.05). Conclusions: These results suggest that needle insertion velocity might be a factor for controlling inadvertent pain during the acupuncture needling process and that biomechanical properties of needling may be related to acupuncture perception or sensation.

AB  - Understanding social tie development among users is crucial for user engagement in social networking services. In this paper, we analyze the social interactions, both online and offline, of users and investigate the development of their social ties using data trail of how social ties grow' left in mobile and social networking services. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research attempt on studying social tie development by considering both online and offline interactions in a heterogeneous yet realistic relationship. In this study, we aim to answer three key questions: (i) is there a correlation between online and offline interactions? (ii) how is the social tie developed via heterogeneous interaction channels? and (iii) would the development of social tie between two users be affected by their common friends? To achieve our goal, we develop a Social-aware Hidden Markov Model (SaHMM) that explicitly takes into account the factor of common friends in measure of the social tie development. Our experiments show that, comparing with results obtained using HMM and other heuristic methods, the social tie development captured by our SaHMM is significantly more consistent to lifetime profiles of users.

AB  - Introduction: Electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) are becoming increasingly popular but little is known about how e-cig users’ transition between the different device types and what device characteristics and preferences may influence the transition. Methods: Four thousand four hundred twenty-one experienced e-cig users completed an online survey about their e-cig use, devices, and preferences. Participants included in analysis were ever cigarette smokers who used an e-cig at least 30 days in their lifetime and who reported the type of their first and current e-cig device and the nicotine concentration of their liquid. Analyses focused on transitions between 'first generation' devices (same size as a cigarette with no button) and 'advanced generation' devices (larger than a cigarette with a manual button) and differences between current users of each device type. Results: Most e-cig users (n = 2603, 58.9%) began use with a first generation device, and of these users, 63.7% subsequently transitioned to current use of an advanced generation device. Among users who began use with an advanced generation device (n = 1818, 41.1%), only 5.7% transitioned to a first generation device. Seventy-seven percent of current advanced generation e-cig users switched to their current device in order to obtain a 'more satisfying hit.' Battery capabilities and liquid flavor choices also influenced device choice. Conclusion: E-cig users commonly begin use with a device shaped like a cigarette and transition to a larger device with a more powerful battery, a button for manual activation and a wider choice of liquid flavors.

AB  - Introduction: Electronic cigarette (e-cig) device characteristics affect use but few studies have evaluated the types of devices commonly used or how users transition between devices. This study examines e-cig device usage patterns and explores the relationship between device transitions and continued use. Methods: E-cig users completed an online survey from 2012 to 2015 about their e-cig use, preferred device, and preferences and were followed-up via an emailed survey in January 2017. Continuing users were those reporting any e-cig use in the past 30 days at both time points while stoppers reported no use at follow-up. Means, frequencies, and Chi-square tests were used as appropriate to describe the sample, the transition between devices, and differences between groups. Results: The sample was 83.6% (n = 511) continuers and 16.3% (n = 100) stoppers. At follow-up, most continuers had transitioned to using more advanced devices like mods (62.6%) with variable voltage (67.7%) and/or wattage (76.8%) and with a tank system (78.6%). Nicotine concentration decreased by half from baseline to follow-up (p < .01). Baseline cigalike users were the most likely to report stopping e-cig use (p < .01) and the most likely to return to other tobacco use (p = .02). Conclusion: The majority of e-cig users continued exclusive e-cig use over 3 + years and were likely to transition to devices with more advanced characteristics like variable voltage and to reduce the nicotine concentration of their liquid. Baseline cigalike users were the most likely to stop e-cig use at follow-up. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The significance of mobile devices in digital learning is growing fast as they allow users to have easier access to content materials and build engaging interactions with others. On the other hand, there exist concerns without enough systematic investigations that users may be distracted when using mobile devices for learning. Drawing upon the value-based adoption perspective in combination with habit, this study investigates m-learning dynamics using a survey method with 257 participants. The results showed that habit has a direct impact on utilitarian/hedonic values and m-learning continuance intention, but a distal influence on learning outcomes. The analysis of results by the mobile device types indicates differences in m-learning dynamics between users with handheld mobile devices and those with laptops. For handheld mobile device users, hedonic value has a greater impact on learning outcomes than utilitarian value does, while utilitarian value has more influence on learning outcomes for laptop users.

AB  - An increasingly competitive fundraising environment and the new media ecosystem have prompted nonprofit organizations to strengthen their digital marketing capabilities. Recently, a few nonprofits have used virtual reality (VR) technology in fundraising, which raises questions about its effectiveness. Does VR work, and if so, through what psychological mechanisms? Through a lab experiment, the usefulness of VR as a digital fundraising tool was investigated. Specifically, we compared the media effects of experiencing the same fundraising video on two different devices: (a) a head-mounted VR and (b) a tablet. The results revealed that donation intention, perceived vividness, perceived interactivity, and social presence were all significantly greater with the VR medium than with the tablet medium. Next, we tested and successfully verified the mediation effect of social presence on donation intention. Finally, we verified that a viewer's sensation-seeking tendency served as a moderator when the device type influenced donation intention. Specifically, the media effects of VR were stronger for high sensation seekers than for low sensation seekers. This study contributes to theory and research by verifying the VR fundraising effect and identifying the key role of social presence, and it also provides important managerial guidelines for media design in VR fundraising campaigns.

AB  - This article analyses how changing life situations affect media use, conceptualized as a question of how biographical disruption could destabilize media repertoires and public connection. To answer this question, the analysis draws on qualitative data from a comprehensive study of media use in Norway, with in-depth interviews and media diaries. The theoretical approach joins domestication and media repertoire theory with research on public connection, considering the ubiquity of digital media in contemporary society. Findings indicate that smartphone use is key to people?s reorientations in periods of change, and that intimate and emotional responses to mobile media warrant closer attention. The article contributes to debates on the transformation of media repertoires, a question of growing concern within research on cross-media use, and to long-standing interests in the role of media in everyday life and as central to public connection.

AB  - The first successful electric automobile in the U.S. debuted in 1891. Over the last century, the development of electric vehicles (EVs) has been intimately tied to the oil market; in recent years, growing environmental concerns have ushered in a new era of EVs. If all light-duty vehicles in the U.S. were replaced by EVs, carbon pollution from transportation would decline by as much as 20 percent.However, many questions need to be answered before embarking on such a daunting task. For instance, to what extent can EVs satisfy the transportation needs in the current market where gasoline vehicles still take up 99% of its share? How can automobile manufactures and city planners efficiently establish the charging infrastructure for EVs? The answers lie in big data.

AB  - This study tested the hypothesis as to whether the mode and time of information technology use-such as using various electronic and computing devices for gambling and collecting information related to gambling-can positively predict disordered gambling, with the effects of Internet gaming addiction and illusory control being taken into account. A questionnaire set was administered to 677 Hong Kong secondary school students to assess their maladaptive gambling behavior, Internet gaming addiction, illusory control, and the habit of information technology use, such as the amount of time spent on watching television, browsing the Internet, and playing online gambling and non-gambling games. The results suggest that utilizing computing and electronic devices for gambling-related activities is positively indicative of disordered gambling, making use of information technology for work or study being a buffering factor. Utilizing information technology for non-gambling activities-such as the durations of playing non-gambling games and making non-gambling purchases online-is not related to disordered gambling, albeit their positive correlations with Internet gaming addiction. Likewise, Internet gaming addiction has no association with using information technology devices for any gambling-related activities, except its very small correlation with playing online gambling games. In addition, tablet computers may provide a convenient means for gambling activities and tend to be used by problem gamblers. It is recommended that intervention strategies targeted at secondary school students should address not only the amount of use but also the way they use information technology devices.

AB  - The 16th China National Reading Survey conducted by Chinese Academy of Press and Publication indicates that in 2018, the trend of reading was characterized by the use of mobile digital devices among Chinese readers. Digital reading continued to maintain its momentum and pushed up the overall percentage of readers in the Chinese population. However, it also contributed to slower growth in the reading of printed materials. Adult Chinese spent the longest time reading on their mobile phones among all kinds of media, while among all traditional printed media, they spent the longest time reading books. In addition, audio reading continued to grow, with mobile audio apps being the main platform for audio books listening. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) aims to improve all mobile applications such as m-learning systems. This study presents an innovative method to use web technology and software engineering’s best practices to provide m-learning functionalities hosted in a MCC-learning system as service. Components hosted by MCC are used to empower developers to create m-learning systems in agile manner. The developed m-learning systems -as tenants of MCC-learning- provide cloud-quality services to their clients. The solution is a service-oriented and three-layered MCC system encompassing innovative m-learning components. To adapt e-contents sent to clients, a Device-Adaptive-Rendering component is used which takes platform, capability, physical and other contextual diversities of mobile devices into account. Using MCC increases the development speed and decreases the Lines Of Code (LOC) to build m-learning systems. Experiment outcomes demonstrate improvement in time taken by learners to answer the learning task questions and accuracy rates. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The objectives of this research were to: (1) identify Mobile Computer Terminal (MCT) human factors issues, (2) formulate guidelines and an enhanced MCT for improving interface design and implementation in police patrols, and (3) identify areas of future research to fill gaps in the literature. A systematic literature search was conducted leading to results categorized in four groups including: productivity, physical discomfort, interface usability, and driving distraction. Although MCT use has increased officer productivity, several usability issues need to be resolved. The MCT has also increased officer physical discomfort and distraction. MCT design and implementation guidelines that resolve human factors issues in police patrols were identified along with an enhanced design concept. Guidelines for MCT design were validated with an online survey completed by 81 police officers. Future research directions were proposed to recognize police officer needs and work context.

AB  - Mobile devices with touch screens, such as tablets are increasingly used in classrooms. Pragmatic advantages are seen in high mobility during computer-based learning due to a high portability of mobile devices and an easy online access to learning applications at places in and outside classrooms. From a psychological perspective, it is of special interest to examine how different modes of interaction with learning materials (e.g. through apps on tablets) affect performance and motivation. For example, touch screens can afford rather natural gestures and embodied interaction. For various contexts, the use of gestures to interact with information presentations (e.g. with 2-D and 3-D visualizations) has been shown to be beneficial for solving spatial tasks. It is of interest whether use of gestures can also improve learning from dynamic visual information presented on touch-based devices. We present and discuss a study in which we focused on the question of whether, for elementary school students, solving spatial tasks can be enhanced by using touch-gestures on mobile devices. Two conditions of spatial rotation tasks were compared using a within-and between subject design: an interactive, touch-based app allowing to physically rotate objects and a paper-based, static version. Elementary school students worked with both conditions, though in different orders. Findings suggest that the app-based, dynamic version improves task solving significantly with regard to success rate, mental and temporal efficiency. However, results clearly show that effects mostly exist only after children had first completed the paper-based, static trial of tasks in which they needed to mentally rotate the objects. The results indicate an additive, enhancing effect of the touch-based, dynamic interaction mode especially for children who already are capable of solving the tasks by using mental rotation processes.

AB  - In this study, the development of an e-learning portal for university students is presented. The portal is based on responsive web design which is accessible from anywhere, at any time and on any device. A complementary user experience evaluation methodology consisting of heuristic evaluation, usability testing, user experience questionnaire and eye tracking has been applied to get a holistic understanding and identification of the potential usability problems in the portal. The methodology highlights the relative efficacy of each method. The results suggest that the heuristic evaluation identified more usability problems than the usability testing. However, few severe usability problems were identified in the usability testing and most of them were not spotted in the heuristic evaluation. For additional insights, the participants' objective visual responses were tracked using an eye tracker (Tobii X-30 Hz); the eye tracking data were also helpful in revealing the usability issues within the portal. The aggregated heat maps were helpful in identifying the complexity of the interface elements of the portal. The identified problems were fixed in the final version of the portal. Afterward, another usability test was carried out to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of the portal. The students' perceptions regarding both versions were also analyzed through the questionnaire. According to the results, the e-learning portal seems to be efficient and effective and the students were satisfied. The proposed methodology resulted in increasing the satisfaction of the students which can lead to the maximum utilization of the e-learning portal. It is recommended that by integrating these evaluation methods, many usability problems can be identified which can then be fixed for achieving maximum user acceptance of the e-learning portals and the similar web portals.

AB  - The identification of the best learning style in an Intelligent Tutoring System must be considered essential as part of the success in the teaching process. In many implementations of automatic classifiers finding the right student learning style represents the hardest assignment. The reason is that most of the techniques work using expert groups or a set of questionnaires which define how the learning styles are assigned to students. This paper presents a novel approach for automatic learning styles classification using a Kohonen network. The approach is used by an author tool for building Intelligent Tutoring Systems running under a Web 2.0 collaborative learning platform. The tutoring systems together with the neural network can also be exported to mobile devices. We present different results to the approach working under the author tool.

AB  - Safety planning, simply put, is a detailed, personalized, and practical plan that is created to protect oneself against an abusive (or potentially abusive) partner. Relying on self-reported data from an online survey of female college students from a state university in Texas, this study focuses on safety strategies centered around escape planning (e.g., whether or not students have a safe place to go, where they would go, and what they would take with them) as well as what factors influence this (e.g., prior experiences with intimate partner violence). Using bivariate analyses to determine any association between factors that influence various aspects of the safety planning process, a number of important findings are reported. The majority of students indicated that they had a safe place to go and this was most likely to be a family or friend?s residence. Additionally, most students noted that they would take what is typically discussed in safety planning strategies (e.g., money, cellular phone, keys, identification, and clothing). Students who reported lower levels of social support and prior exposure to parental domestic violence were more likely to report they did not have a safe place to go. These findings underscore the importance of expanding violence prevention activities on college campuses beyond sexual assault, with information provided to all students on safety planning.

AB  - This research examines the effectiveness of using the VoiceThread (VT) application (both web and mobile-based) for the development of oral English skills of Russian university students. The study involved 44 full-time bachelor students in non-linguistic departments. The results were evaluated by on-line questionnaire using SurveyMonkey. The survey indicated that the majority of students agreed that mobile VoiceThread developed their oral language skills (M = 4.75) and they enjoyed using it for language learning (M = 4.13). The novelty of the research lies in a more integral assessment of the entire set of oral linguistic skills as a result of their development using a specific mobile learning platform widely used throughout the world. The results can be used in practice to implement mobile learning platforms for teaching oral language skills to students with basic knowledge of a foreign language.

AB  - One of the major obstacles to effective pricing emanates from difficulties experienced in predicting business buyers' price sensitivity. With a view to obviating these obstacles, this study examines the effect of five key physical distribution service quality dimensions on price sensitivity from the perspective of small and medium retail buyers. Based on a survey of 233 cellular phone retailers in China, the authors articulate how the five salient service quality dimensions exert either direct effects on price sensitivity or indirect impacts through perceived value and customer satisfaction. Theoretical and managerial implications are also provided for effective retailer relationship management, profitability improvement, and customer segmentation in distribution channels.

AB  - This article addresses the cumulative effect of graduate migration and opportunities for career development. Using data from an online survey of 756 master?s-level graduates educated in China and the UK, it examines their geographical mobility patterns and reveals significant differences between Chinese students who graduated from domestic universities and those who were educated abroad. Spatial autocorrelation analysis shows that international returnees, who usually had more privileged family backgrounds, clustered in China?s highly developed core cities of the Bohai Economic Rim and Yangtze River Delta regions, such as Beijing and Shanghai, while domestic graduates tended to work and live in less affluent medium-sized cities around these regions. Women international graduates were more mobile than their men counterparts. Our results provide new evidence that draws attention to migration?s role in graduate career development opportunities and highlights inherent economic discrimination within China, which is perpetuated by the national residency permit system ? Hukou. The case of Chinese graduates shows that the mobility patterns of international and domestic graduates are influenced by and contribute to growing regional inequalities for career development in China.

AB  - This paper presents results from a web-based study that investigates users' attitudes toward smart devices, focusing on acceptability. Specifically, we conducted a survey that elicits users' ratings of devices in isolation and devices in the context of tasks potentially performed by these devices. Our study led to insights about users' attitudes towards devices in isolation and in the context of tasks, and about the influence of demographic factors and factors pertaining to technical expertise and experience with devices on users' attitudes. The insights about users' attitudes provided the basis for two recommendation approaches based on principal components analysis (PCA) that alleviate the new-user and new-item problems: (1)employing latent features identified by PCA to predict ratings given by existing users to new devices, and by new users to existing devices; and (2)identifying a relatively small set of key questions on the basis of PCs, whose answers account to a large extent for new users' ratings of devices in isolation and in the context of tasks. Our results show that taking into account latent features of devices, and asking a relatively small number of key questions about devices in the context of tasks, lead to rating predictions that are significantly more accurate than global and demographic predictions, and substantially reduce prediction error, eventually matching the performance of strong baselines.

AB  - Handsets are being transformed from the traditional cellular phone to an integrated content delivery platform for communications. Their increasing capabilities and value-added features provide more utilities, and at the same time, make the design more complicated and the devices more difficult to use. The objective of this study was to explore and identify the critical factors that predicate the handset’s perceived usability. An online survey was conducted by using a seven-point Likert-scale structured questionnaire tailored to measure the user’s perception of the usability level of their current handset. A total of nine usability dimensions were derived from the results of exploratory factor analysis. The total variance explained by these nine factors was 65.20% of the overall variance of the data. Relationships between the nine usability factors and handset design features were described by regression models. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - With the popularity of question-and-answer (Q&A) communities, widespread dissemination of scientific knowledge has become more viable than ever before. However, those contributing high-quality professional scientific knowledge are confronted with the challenge of making their contributions popular, since nonexpert readers may not recognize the importance of their contributions given the massive amount of information available online. In this study, we show that nonexpert readers are capable of evaluating the professionalism of content contributed in such communities as well as experts. However, we discovered that a salient discrepancy exists between the content nonexperts favor and the content they perceive as professional. In line with studies that have suggested that writing techniques play an important role in how expert content is received by laypersons, we investigated how the use of linguistic devices affects both the perceived professionalism and the popularity of contributions in Q&A communities. Based on both secondary data and a scenario-based survey, we identified specific linguistic devices that can increase content popularity without reducing perceived professionalism. Additionally, we revealed linguistic devices that increase popularity at the expense of perceived professionalism in this context. Finally, we conducted a laboratory experiment to more firmly establish the causal effects of the linguistic device use. The triangulated findings have important implications for both research and practice on communicating scientific knowledge in Q&A communities.

AB  - As part of the digital publishing revolution, the advent of eReader devices has had a strong impact on the reading habits of ordinary people and the traditional publishing industry. This study investigated how people have changed their reading behavior with the rise of the eReader by analyzing the amount of reading of different material and their media preferences among different platforms. An online survey was designed to study the changes in reading habits of faculty and staff from the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). On January 13th, 2011, an email with a survey link was sent through the RIT e-mail system. The survey was closed after two weeks. Of the 3,600 potential respondents, 600 started the survey, while 563 completed the survey yielding a response rate of 15.6%. The study found that there were no statistically significant differences between eReader users and non-users in the average amount of printed books and printed magazines consumed. However, although half of the eReader users believed their printed book reading had stayed the same after purchasing an eReader, of the 145 eReader users, 38% reported reading fewer. A similar patterns was found for magazines. The majority of respondents (86%) reported their printed magazine reading had remained the same although 10% of the eReader users indicated that they had read fewer after purchasing an eReader. The study also showed that eReader users and non-users shared similar interests in consuming media content. E-mail and news were the most consumed texts both on computer screens and eReaders by RIT faculty and staff, and there were no differences in amount of time spent on computer reading for eReader users and non-users. In addition, only 5.1% of eReader users and 1.9% of non-users in this study said they had read eBooks on computers, making the computer the least popular platform for book reading. The study revealed that eReaders were the most popular devices among eBook readers. The Amazon's Kindle and Apple's iPad ranked were the most popular brands among eReader users and potential buyers. In sum, this study showed that using an eReader device has not impacted reading behavior in the sample of respondents who were older and more educated than the general public. Other results from this study were consistent with previous studies: the younger generation was more likely to adopt an eReader than the older generation; males were more likely to purchase an eReader device than females; and eReader users were still printed media lovers.

In this paper the authors discuss the impact of recent mobile technology advancements on mobile threat environment and mobile security practices. They also conducted a survey to 262 college students to examine their mobile phone usage patterns, security concerns and practices. The results show that students use their mobile phone frequently for various productivity and entertainment purposes. They are generally aware of and concerned about mobile security, not only on losing the phone physically but also on data theft, web threat, and mobile malware. Students also practice security to some extend - most change PIN and passwords regularly, download their apps mostly from official app stores, and generally keep their OS and apps up-to-date. The authors also found significant correlations between mobile security practices and personal attributes, including major, gender, and technology aptitude.

AB  - Work-based learning refers to the learning process occurring at workplace as acquiring knowledge and skills or developing approaches to solve problems. It is a crucial approach to promote professionals' working efficiency. However, the majority of research on professional learning concentrates on holding trainings (off-the-job or on-the-job), seminars and workshops, or on implementing systems for distributing training materials or facilitating communication. Few effort has been paid to support work-based learning which has the characteristics like informal, spontaneous, work-related and just-in-time. The purpose of our work is to facilitate professionals' work-based learning with a context aware mobile system. This system can guide professionals to engage in work-based learning activities, which are arranged properly based on our online survey results. It can also provide learning supports which are adapted to current engaged work, professionals' learning needs, personal characteristics, environmental situations, etc. In this paper, we present successively the work -based learning activity design, the system structure design, the system technical implementation, the system functionalities and evaluation of learning achievement, and the user attitude and acceptance about this system. With the proposed system, professionals can use their mobile devices to get personalized, adaptive and just in-time learning supports in real working environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, we examine the price process of eBay online auctions. We pool sparse and unevenly spaced bidding histories of individual auctions, resulting in an unbalanced panel of bids. Since the price processes of online auctions are monotonically increasing within individual auctions and exhibit a substantial degree of heterogeneity, we propose a monotone series estimator for panel data with auction-specific slopes for a common relative price growth curve. We generalize Ramsay's (1998, J R Stat Soc B 60(2):365-375) monotone series estimator to fit our panel model of the price process. We apply the proposed model and estimator to eBay auctions of a popular hand-held device (a Palm PDA). The results are shown to capture closely the overall pattern of observed price dynamics. In particular, the early bidding, mid-auction bidding drought, and end-auction bid sniping are well approximated by the estimated price curve.

AB  - Purpose: Recent research has identified a relationship between perceived stress and problematic smartphone usage. However, little is known about the underlying mediating and moderating mechanisms. The present study aimed to test the relationship between perceived stress and problematic smartphone usage as well as the mediating role of online social support and the moderating role of perceived social support among Chinese undergraduates.
Patients and Methods: A sample of 1123 college students participated in the study. The Perceived Stress Scale, Mobile Phone Addiction Index Scale, Online Social Support Questionnaire, and Perceived Social Support Scale were used.
Results: Perceived stress was significantly and positively associated with problematic smartphone usage, and online social support partially mediated the relationship between perceived stress and problematic smartphone usage. Moderated mediation analysis suggested that perceived social support moderated the association between perceived stress and online social support. This relationship became stronger for college students with lower levels of perceived social support.
Conclusion: The results of this study can contribute to a better understanding of how perceived stress increases the risk of problematic smartphone usage. The importance of reducing online social support and enhancing perceived social support in preventing undergraduates' problematic smartphone usage is highlighted. The findings should be taken with caution given the convenience sampling and cross-sectional study design.

AB  - By coupling parametric modeling, building performance simulation engines, and optimization algorithms, optimal design choices regarding predefined building performance objectives can be automatically obtained. This becomes an emerging research topic among scholars in the fields of architecture and built environment. However, it is not easy to apply this method to real building design projects, because of two main drawbacks: Building performance simulation is too time consuming, and the numerical visualization of final results is not intuitive for architects to make decisions. Therefore, this study tries to fill these two gaps by training an artificial neural network to replace simulation engines and developing a web application to speed up the 3D visualization of selected design choices. These two strategies are applied to optimize office towers' window wall ratios in Hangzhou, China. Architects working on new design projects in that city can obtain the optimal group of window wall ratios for four facades in 2 s, faster than using simulation engines, which cost architects 2 weeks. Moreover, architects can also efficiently observe the appearance of design solutions with the web application. By improving its usability from these two aspects, this study significantly improves the applicability of algorithmic optimization for building design projects.

AB  - Disability care is an understudied yet important phenomenon within the realm of caring media studies. It not only adds another identity-based lens for caring media studies but also proposes new questions at the intersection of media, disability and cultural studies. This study proposes a Chinese contextualized understanding of disability caring media, which may have broader implications in other contexts, even a global one. Mainly based on actor-network theory (ANT), this study looks at the smartphone as a new condition and a key actor in the emerging digital disability care actor-network to examine various modes of connections and associations, especially the application-network, the device-network, and the organization-network. This study seeks to provide a better understanding as to how meanings and technologies are enacted together in everyday caring practices, and how social dynamics are assembled and reassembled in contemporary disability caring media settings.

AB  - We argue that the usage of mobile apps could be understood in the context of being permanently online. That is, contrary to functionalist theories, the usage of mobile apps is not simply an outcome based on the user's rational needs and goals but also reflects the new state of being in the online world of the mobile Internet environment. Following this approach, in this study we review the emerging concept of being permanently online, as well as two key influential factors: the fear of missing out (FOMO) and the feeling of acceleration. We then use the survey data collected from university students in Shanghai, China (N = 687) to examine the relationships between FOMO, the feeling of acceleration, being permanently online, and two types of mobile apps usage (i.e. WeChat and O2O life service apps). The results showed that in controlling for other variables, FOMO, the feeling of acceleration, and being permanently online were significantly related to mobile apps usage. In particular, FOMO was positively related to being permanently online. These empirical findings demonstrate the significance of examining mobile app usage from a new theoretical perspective, and they indicate that this approach deserves further attention in the research on this topic.

AB  - WeChat is not only a mobile application with many innovative features but is also representative of China’s electronic revolution. It is compatible with more than 90% of smart phones and has become an indispensable tool for daily use. People are captivated by various types of WeChat voting and canvassing activities, but little research has investigated whether such voting is based on guanxi or justice. Are people truly willing to vote on WeChat? Is WeChat voting an effective means of acquaintance marketing? In this research, three studies were conducted. First, 656 respondents were surveyed, and the results showed that more than 90% of WeChat users have participated in WeChat voting and that their voting behaviour is based on guanxi (human relations). Second, an online questionnaire was administered to 731 subjects, and the results were statistically analysed to determine whether voting behaviour is motivated by guanxi (mien-tzu, reciprocity or intimacy) or by justice (belief in a just world). The results showed that people’s behaviour deviates from their intention. Third, 676 subjects were investigated, and logistic regression was used to model and analyse the characteristics of voting participants. The many interesting findings reveal that men show more ‘empathy’ than women and that men are more likely to vote on WeChat based on reciprocity and intimacy. In addition, older people emphasize emotion, whereas students are more interested in fostering connections for the future. Inappropriate WeChat voting behaviour does not facilitate promotional marketing, damages the reputation of the company and reduces customer loyalty. These findings provide theoretical, methodological, and practical contributions to strategies for effective acquaintance marketing. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of social support on social capital in mobile social networking sites.
Design/methodology/approach - Based on the 234 valid responses collected from a survey, structural equation modelling was employed to examine the research model.
Findings - The results indicated that social support, which includes informational support and emotional support, has a significant effect on social capital that consists of structural, relational and cognitive capital.
Originality/value - Although previous research has found the effect of social capital on user behaviour, it has seldom identified the determinants of social capital. Thus, how to build and develop social capital remains a question. This research examined the effect of social support on social capital.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this research is to examine the effect of flow experience on mobile social networking service (SNS) users' loyalty.
Design/methodology/approach - Based on 305 valid responses collected from a survey questionnaire, structural equation modeling (SEM) technology was employed to examine the research model.
Findings - The results show that both information quality and system quality significantly affect users' trust and flow experiences, which further determine their loyalty. The results indicate that flow experience is the strongest determinant of users' loyalty.
Practical implications - Mobile SNS providers need to consider user experience when seeking users' loyalty. They should enhance information quality and system quality in order to improve user trust and flow experience.
Originality/value - Although much research has been conducted to explore the effects of extrinsic motivations, such as perceived usefulness, on mobile commerce user behavior, the effect of intrinsic motivations, such as flow experience, is seldom tested. This research found the effect of flow experience on mobile SNS users' loyalty to be significant.

AB  - Haptic technologies are often used to improve access to the structural content of graphical user interfaces, thereby augmenting the interaction process for blind users. While haptic design guidelines offer valuable assistance when developing non-visual interfaces, the recommendations presented are often tailored to the feedback produced via one particular haptic input/output device. A blind user is therefore restricted to interacting with a device which may be unfamiliar to him/her, rather than selecting from the range of commercially available products. This paper reviews devices available on the first and second-hand markets, and describes an exploratory study undertaken with 12 blindfolded sighted participants to determine the effectiveness of three devices for non-visual web interaction. The force-feedback devices chosen for the study, ranged in the number of translations and rotations that the user was able to perform when interacting with them. Results have indicated that the Novint Falcon could be used to target items faster in the first task presented, compared with the other devices. However, participants agreed that the force-feedback mouse was most comfortable to use when interacting with the interface. Findings have highlighted the benefits which low cost haptic input/output devices can offer to the non-visual browsing process, and any changes which may need to be made to accommodate their deficiencies. The study has also highlighted the need for web designers to integrate appropriate haptic feedback on their web sites to cater for the strengths and weaknesses of various devices, in order to provide universally accessible sites and online applications. © 2011 British Informatics Society Limited.

AB  - In order to design a "haptic zoom", in this fundamental study, we compare two scaling methods by focusing on the strategies adopted by subjects who are using a sensory substitution device. Method 1 consists of a reduction of the sensor size and of its displacement speed. Speed reduction is obtained by a "human" movement adjustment (hand speed reduction). Method 2 consists of a straightforward increase in the dimensions of the image. The experimental device used couples a pen on a graphics tablet with tactile sensory stimulators. These are activated when the sensor impinges on the outline of the figure on the computer screen. This virtual sensor (a square matrix composed of 16 elementary fields) moves when the pen, guided by human hand movements, moves on the graphics tablet. The results show that the recognition rate is closely dependent on the size of the figure, and that the strategies used by the subjects are more suitable for method 2 than for method 1. In fact, half of the subjects found that method 1 inhibited their movements, and the majority of them did not feel the scaling effect, whereas this was clearly felt in method 2. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is an indispensable tool in the study of gene regulation. While the technology has brought with it better transcript coverage and quantification, there remain considerable barriers to entry for the computational biologist to analyse large data sets. There is a real need for a repository of uniformly processed RNA-seq data that is easy to use. Findings: To address these obstacles, we developed Digital Expression Explorer 2 (DEE2), a web-based repository of RNA-seq data in the form of gene-level and transcript-level expression counts. DEE2 contains >5.3 trillion assigned reads from 580,000 RNA-seq data sets including species Escherichia coli, yeast, Arabidopsis, worm, fruit fly, zebrafish, rat, mouse, and human. Base-space sequence data downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information Sequence Read Archive underwent quality control prior to transcriptome and genome mapping using open-source tools. Uniform data processing methods ensure consistency across experiments, facilitating fast and reproducible meta-analyses. Conclusions: The web interface allows users to quickly identify data sets of interest using accession number and keyword searches. The data can also be accessed programmatically using a specifically designed R package. We demonstrate that DEE2 data are compatible with statistical packages such as edgeR or DESeq. Bulk data are also available for download. DEE2 can be found at http://dee2.io.

AB  - (Future) teachers should acquire skills in sourcing science-related information online, so they can use evidence appropriately in their pedagogical practice. To successfully use such evidence, it is vital that teachers critically question their selection of online information. Based on findings from collaborative learning, we hypothesized that collaboration promotes teachers' critical elaboration of their selection of online educational information. Additionally, collaboration allows for social comparison and may thus impact teachers' self-efficacy in seeking information. In a 2 x 2 mixed-design study with the between-participants factor reasoning (individual vs. collaborative) and the within-participants factor self-reported information seeking self-efficacy (pre vs. post the reasoning task), each of N = 83 future teachers individually sought online information regarding the educational use of mobile phones in classrooms. This constituted a realistic search on the Internet, in a natural setting. Based on each participant's particular search, s / he was asked to select the online sources that s / he perceived relevant for reasoning whether mobile phones should be used in class. To foster reflection on how they selected information, participants were asked either to reason individually (individual group, n = 33) or to chat collaboratively (collaboration group, n = 50 in 25 dyads) about their selections. Participants in both groups reported higher information seeking self-efficacy after the reasoning task. Yet participants who collaboratively reflected on their selections more frequently showed elaborated reasoning behavior, than did participants in the individual group. Nonetheless, participants in both groups referred to certain criteria that guided their selection (i. e., criteria related to the information, the provider of information, or media) with the same frequency. Considering the potential benefits and challenges of collaboration, we discuss the findings in terms of how to promote future teachers' ability to critically reflect on their selection of online educational information.

AB  - Nearly 6000 adults from 7 countries participated in an online survey about what other activities they engaged in while taking the survey and how distracted they felt. Younger people were more likely than older ones to engage in electronic and non-electronic multitasking. Engaging in a wider range of tasks was associated with feeling more distracted. However, once the variety of tasks was taken into account, interruptions associated with checking or talking on one’s phone made participants feel less distracted. The relationship between age, multitasking, and feeling distraction was curvilinear, with middle-aged respondents being more affected by multitasking than either younger or older survey takers. The findings suggest that people of all ages are often deliberate multitaskers who choose their distractions intentionally, at least some of the time. This bodes well for researchers seeking to administer online surveys, because it suggests that survey takers will set themselves up with the type and amount of distractions they are comfortable with. The finding that a high degree of electronic multitasking may decrease the perception of distraction should be followed by experiments verifying if this perception corresponds to actual task performance.
