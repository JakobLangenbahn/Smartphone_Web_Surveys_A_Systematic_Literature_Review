AB  - Background: The advent of Internet-based self-help systems for common mental disorders has generated a need for quick ways to triage would-be users to systems appropriate for their disorders. This need can be met by using brief online screening questionnaires, which can also be quickly used to screen patients prior to consultation with a GP. Objective: To test and enhance the validity of the Web Screening Questionnaire (WSQ) to screen for: depressive disorder, alcohol abuse/dependence, GAD, PTSD, social phobia, panic disorder, agoraphobia, specific phobia, and OCD. Methods: A total of 502 subjects (aged 18-80) answered the WSQ and 9 other questionnaires on the Internet. Of these 502, 157 were assessed for DSM-IV-disorders by phone in a WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview with a CIDI-trained interviewer. Results: Positive WSQ 'diagnosis' had significantly (P < .001) higher means on the corresponding validating questionnaire than negative WSQ 'diagnosis'. WSQ sensitivity was 0.72-1.00 and specificity was 0.44-0.77 after replacing three items (GAD, OCD, and panic) and adding one question for specific phobia. The Areas Under the Curve (AUCs) of the WSQ’s items with scaled responses were comparable to AUCs of longer questionnaires. Conclusions: The WSQ screens appropriately for common mental disorders. While the WSQ screens out negatives well, it also yields a high number of false positives. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Introduction: The purpose of this investigation was to compare the results of a web-based and a telephone interview survey measuring driver concerns about a variety of traffic safety issues, their beliefs, and specific driving behaviors. Method: State-wide, annual random digit-dial telephone surveys and web-based surveys were conducted in Maryland. A total of 1,700 drivers were surveyed by telephone and 6,806 took a web survey. Results: Telephone respondents were more likely to be female and older. Web respondents were more likely to be white and not Latino/Hispanic. After controlling for demographic differences, telephone survey respondents were more likely to be concerned about traffic safety. They were more likely to believe that sobriety checkpoints reduce drunk driving (OR=2.18, 95% CI 1.94, 2.45), they would be ticketed for not wearing a seat belt (OR=1.26, 95% CI 1.12, 1.43), and they would be stopped by the police if they drove after drinking too much (OR=1.17, 95% CI 1.03, 1.32). They were less likely to report a variety of risky behaviors including using a cell phone while driving (OR=.54, 95% CI .48, .61) and driving 10+ mph over the speed limit (OR=.81, 95% CI .72, .91), but were more likely to report having been ticketed for a moving violation in the last month (OR=2.22, 95% CI 1.70, 2.90). Suggestions are offered for overcoming potential sources of sampling bias. Impact on Industry: Web-based surveys produce substantially different results than random-digit-dial telephone surveys, when used for public assessments of traffic safety concerns and behaviors.

AB  - The under-reporting of public safety incidents is a long-standing issue. In this paper, we propose a computational cognitive modeling approach to understand and design a mobile crowdsourcing system for improving campus safety reporting. In particular, we adopt drift-diffusion models (DDMs) from cognitive psychology to investigate the effect of various factors on users’ reporting tendency for public safety. Our lab experiment and online study show consistent results on how location context impacts people's reporting decisions. This finding informs the design of a novel location-based nudge mechanism, which is tested in another lab experiment with 84 participants and proved to be effective in changing users’ reporting decisions. Our follow-up interview study further suggests that the influence of people's mobility patterns (e.g., expected walking distance) could explain why the nudge design is effective. Our work not only informs the design of mobile crowdsourcing for public safety reporting but also demonstrates the value of applying a computational cognitive modeling approach to address HCI research questions more broadly.

AB  - This study critically compares offline focus groups, online focus groups and email discussions with respect to their depth, breadth, efficiency, group dynamics, non-verbal impressions and respondent attitudes. In addition, we add an important element to the email discussion—a feedback loop (e-Delphi)—that can strengthen this form of qualitative research. Discussions in an online focus group take place in a virtual discussion room, where all respondents can view and react to the comments of the moderator and their fellow participants. All respondents are online at the same time, which allows for direct interactions and a synchronous group discussion. The moderator, similar to those in traditional focus groups, plays an important role by leading discussions, asking questions, clarifying ambiguities, summarizing the discussion and ensuring that all important aspects of the research question are discussed. Special online focus group software gives the researcher plenty of opportunities to guide the group discussion. Respondents do not need any special software—a computer and internet connection are sufficient. The central research question for all three methods involves examining the expectations and attitudes of the target groups with respect to mobile phones and mobile internet via general packet radio service (GPRS). All three methods include two different types of respondent, recruited from an existing internet panel according to demographic requirements, The results from our study show that online and offline focus groups and e-Delphi methods differ greatly in terms of their results. All three have their own unique characteristics that influence their degree of suitability for handling specific research situations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Despite rapid technological development, very few new technology-assisted tools have been developed specifically for use in family services. This article describes a new, mobile-assisted working model designed to enhance the quality of daily family life. The model has its origins in the existing research on daily family life and on the diary method, which has been widely used in data collection in family research. The model provides support for the daily life of client families in the intervals between meetings with family counselors via the use of text messages. The pilot study explored family members’ and family counselors’ experiences of using the model. Data on 26 parents and four children participating in the new mobile-based service were collected via feedback text messages and web questionnaires. The research findings are also based on interviews with family counselors (n = 6). Although clients’ experiences of the model varied widely, the results show that, in general, it was regarded as effective in invoking reflection, keeping the goals of family counseling in mind and implementing family practices at home. On the basis of the experiences of the family counselors, the mobile-based working model offers a new, systematic, and structured tool for use in working with families and monitoring processes in families.

AB  - Purpose: Although mobile devices are ubiquitous among employees, their awareness and readiness to use mobile technologies for competence development is still not widespread and therefore requires further exploration. The purpose of this study is to propose a conceptual model based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) to explain the determinants that affect employees’ intention to use mobile devices and software for knowledge transfer during the process of knowledge management. Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual model based on the UTAUT with new variables concerning relative usability (RU) and user autonomy (UA) and new connections between the determinants was developed as a result of a subject matter literature review. A structural equation modelling approach was used to validate the model on the basis of data collected via a survey collected from 371 employees from 21 sectors, both public and private. Findings: The UTAUT model extended by new variables like RU and UA explains employee acceptance of mobile technologies for knowledge transfer reasonably well. New proposed variables highlighted that the usability of technology compared to other solutions and user autonomy in the selection and the use of applications have the strongest impact on the employees’ intention to use mobile devices and software for knowledge transfer. Research limitations/implications: This model explains the 55 per cent behavioral intention of employees to use mobile technologies for knowledge transfer. Even though it is quite high in terms of acceptance theories, some new variables should be explored. Furthermore, study does not verify whether m-learning acceptance for knowledge transfer is sector-specific. Practical implications: Mobile technologies used for knowledge transfer by employees should allow for high UA through their ability to select solutions that they find convenient, use of preferred platforms, personalize applications and utilize devices and software in various environments. They should not be simplified and should have the same functionality and efficiency of use as alternative solutions like web and desktop applications, even if additional effort to learn them would be required. Mobile technologies that take into account UA and RU support the process of employees capturing, distributing and effectively using knowledge. Originality/value: The elaborated model provides a valuable solution with practical implications for increasing mobile technologies acceptance for knowledge transfer. The study results contribute both to knowledge management and technology acceptance research fields by introducing two new determinants for the acceptance of technologies in knowledge transfer, such as UA and RU with several additional connections between existing UTAUT variables.

AB  - Objective: To define the natural history of X-linked myotubular myopathy (MTM). Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study that included an online survey (n = 35) and a prospective, 1-year longitudinal investigation using a phone survey (n = 33). Results: We ascertained data from 50 male patients with MTM and performed longitudinal assessments on 33 affected individuals. Consistent with existing knowledge, we found that MTM is a disorder associated with extensive morbidities, including wheelchair (86.7% nonambulant) and ventilator (75% requiring > 16 hours of support) dependence. However, unlike previous reports and despite the high burden of disease, mortality was lower than anticipated (approximate rate 10%/y). Seventy-six percent of patients with MTM enrolled (mean age 10 years 11 months) were alive at the end of the study. Nearly all deaths in the study were associated with respiratory failure. In addition, the disease course was more stable than expected, with few adverse events reported during the prospective survey. Few non–muscle-related morbidities were identified, although an unexpectedly high incidence of learning disability (43%) was noted. Conversely, MTM was associated with substantial burdens on patient and caregiver daily living, reflected by missed days of school and lost workdays. Conclusions: MTM is one of the most severe neuromuscular disorders, with affected individuals requiring extensive mechanical interventions for survival. However, among study participants, the disease course was more stable than predicted, with more individuals surviving infancy and early childhood. These data reflect the disease burden of MTM but offer hope in terms of future therapeutic intervention. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In this chapter, we present a new randomizing device. It uses a 'randomizing question' and comprises several desirable properties. Besides its ease of use and its applicability in all survey situations, it allows for increasing the statistical efficiency of the Randomized Response Technique (RRT) without jeopardizing respondents' perceived privacy protection. For the latter, the method makes use of Benford's law and takes advantage of respondents' misperception of the properties of Benford-distributed numbers such as, in our example, house numbers. We show how this method can be implemented and we present results of its first large-scale empirical evaluation in an online survey on student cheating. Furthermore, we will discuss the important difference between respondents' objective privacy protection in RRT designs and their subjectively perceived privacy protection.

AB  - Using images of objects as queries is a new approach to search for information on the Web. Image-based information retrieval goes beyond only matching images, as information in other modalities also can be extracted from data collections using an image search. We have developed a new system that uses images to search for web-based information. This paper has a particular focus on exploring users’ experience of general mobile image-based web searches to find what issues and phenomena it contains. This was achieved in a multi part study by creating and letting respondents test prototypes of mobile image-based search systems and collect data using interviews, observations, video observations, and questionnaires. We observed that searching for information based only on visual similarity and without any assistance is sometimes difficult, especially on mobile devices with limited interaction bandwidth. Most of our subjects preferred a search tool that guides the users through the search result based on contextual information, compared to presenting the search result as a plain ranked list.

AB  - An increasing number of people are tracking their fitness activities, work performance and leisure experiences using body sensors (e.g., wristbands or smartwatches) and mobile applications. This trend, referred to as self-quantification, is driven by various motivations, from curiosity to a desire to improve performance. As self-quantification by means of digital devices is a new behavioural trend, the phenomenon has only recently received academic attention. Neither antecedents nor the implications of this phenomenon have been thoroughly investigated. This paper aims to address these gaps. Based on the literature on self-quantification, privacy and self-disclosure, we empirically test the relationship among personality traits, privacy, self-quantification and self-disclosure. The findings suggest that conscientiousness and emotional stability are associated with self-quantification. In addition, we find a significant effect of self-quantification on self-disclosure in the survey context, indicating that individuals who habitually use self-tracking applications and wearable devices are also more likely to disclose personal data in other contexts.

AB  - The HCAHPS Survey obtains hospital patients’ experiences using four modes: Mail Only, Phone Only, Mixed (mail/phone follow-up), and Touch-Tone (push-button) Interactive Voice Response with option to transfer to live interviewer (TT-IVR/Phone). A new randomized experiment examines two less expensive modes: Web/Mail (mail invitation to participate by Web or request a mail survey) and Speech-Enabled IVR (SE-IVR/Phone; speaking to a voice recognition system; optional transfer to an interviewer). Web/Mail had a 12% response rate (vs. 32% for Mail Only and 33% for SE-IVR/Phone); Web/Mail respondents were more educated and less often Black than Mail Only respondents. SE-IVR/Phone respondents (who usually switched to an interviewer) were less often older than 75 years, more often English-preferring, and reported better care than Mail Only respondents. Concerns regarding inconsistencies across implementations, low adherence to primary modes, or low response rate may limit the applicability of the SE-IVR/Phone and Web/Mail modes in HCAHPS and similar standardized environments.

AB  - Today, the learning model of a single instructor interacting with many students that is applied in conventional classrooms forms a passive bottleneck. Moreover, the instructor cannot effectively record students’ individual learning histories for instantaneous and suitable feedback. To address these issues using a mobile learning system (MLS) the authors have applied the principles of human-computer interaction (HCI) to construct a usable MLS on a personal digital assistant (PDA) The research focuses on adaptive content delivery within the context of small-screen design. The authors utilized task analysis, a literature review, experimental design and approaches to small-screen design, and addressed potential issues with presentation in order to design a friendly PDA interface whose performance was analyzed with a post-experiment user satisfaction questionnaire. The results of this experiment show that the mobile-based classroom learning experience provides appropriate mobile tools to help students to become capable, self-reliant, self-motivated, and independent. The findings also demonstrate that variations among students’ preference for content are associated with differences in the display presentation mode, and that the landscape interface is recommended for use in some contexts.

AB  - Introduction: The literature indicates that few studies have been conducted with persons with visual impairments (that is, those who are blind or have low vision) concerning mobile application or 'app' usage. The current study explores the use of mobile apps with this population globally. Methods: A total of 259 participants with visual impairments completed an online survey. Descriptive statistics and bivariate tests were used to examine associations between demographic characteristics and mobile app use. Results: The participants rated special apps as useful (95.4%) and accessible (91.1%) tools for individuals with visual impairments. More than 90% of the middle-aged adult group strongly agreed with the practicality of special apps, a significantly higher percentage than was observed in the young and old adult groups. In addition, the participants with low vision considered special apps less accessible than did those with blindness (p > .05). Discussion: Results show that persons with visual impairments frequently use apps specifically designed for them to accomplish daily activities. Furthermore, this population is satisfied with mobile apps and would like to see improvements and new apps. Implications for practitioners: Developers of apps for individuals with visual impairments need to refine and test the existing apps. Practitioners need to be knowledgeable about app usage so they can provide effective instruction to their students or clients. This study provides preliminary information regarding app usage among persons with visual impairments. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The advancement of wireless and mobile technologies has enabled students to learn in an environment that combines learning resources from both the real world and the digital world. Although such an approach has been recognized as being innovative and important, several problems have been revealed in practical learning activities. One major problem is owing to the lack of proper learning strategies or tools for assisting the students to acquire knowledge in such a complex learning scenario. Students might feel excited or engaged when using the mobile devices to learn in the real context; nevertheless, their learning achievements could be disappointing. To deal with this problem, this study presents a mobile learning system that employs Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to detect and examine real-world learning behaviors of students. This study also utilizes each student’s responses from a two-tier test (i.e., multiple-choice questions in a two-level format) to provide personalized learning guidance (called two-tier test guiding, T³G). The experimental results from a natural science course of an elementary school show that this innovative approach is able to improve the learning achievements of students as well as enhance their learning motivation.

AB  - Studies have shown that any information and communication technology (ICT) intervention that improves the livelihoods of poor rural families is likely to have a significant impact (direct and indirect) on enhancing agricultural production, marketing, and post-harvest activities. Notable ICT services include: online information services; communication between researchers, extension (knowledge) workers, and farmers; updates on current market information; weather forecasting; input supplies; and credit availability. The lack of up-to-date ICTs can negatively affect information access and utilization among information users. The study sought to investigate the levels of ICT access and utilization by researchers and extension workers within the Ministry of Agriculture, Mechanisation and Irrigation Development and how this affected the generation and dissemination of agricultural information among researchers and extension workers. Survey questionnaires were distributed to researchers at the various institutes in the five agro-ecological zones and to extension workers in 10 provinces. The study revealed that the role of ICTs in work and as an information channel was considered inadequate despite the indications by the majority of extension workers and researchers that they had access to ICTs. Findings on the utilization of ICTs in managing information generated by the Departments of Research and Specialist Services and Agricultural Technical and Extension Services revealed that while some ICTs were used to generate documents, most distribution of documents involved hard copies. Available ICTs included computers, printers, telephones, television, Internet, mobile phones, and fax machines, and these were considered effective in the dissemination of agricultural information, although the levels of effectiveness varied according to the resources and respondents.

AB  - Purpose: Electronic cigarettes (e cigarettes) are a new type of device that delivers vaporized nicotine without the tobacco combustion of regular cigarettes. We sought to understand aware ness of and willingness to try e cigarettes among adolescent males, a group that is at risk for smoking initiation and may use e cigarettes as a 'gateway' to smoking. Methods: A national sample of 11-19 year old males (n = 228) completed an online survey in November 2011. We recruited participants through their parents, who were members of a panel of U.S. households constructed using random digit dialing and addressed based sampling. Results: Only two participants (< 1%) had previously tried e cigarettes. Among those who had not tried e cigarettes, most (67%) had heard of them. Awareness was higher among older and non Hispanic adolescents. Nearly 1 in 5 (18%) participants were willing to try either a plain or flavored e cigarette, but willingness to try plain versus flavored varieties did not differ. Smokers were more willing to try any e cigarette than nonsmokers (74% vs. 13%; OR 10.25, 95% CI 2.88, 36.46). Nonsmokers who had more negative beliefs about the typical smoker were less willing to try e cigarettes (OR .58, 95% CI .43, .79). Conclusions: Most adolescent males were aware of e cigarettes, and a substantial minority were willing to try them. Given that even experimentation with e cigarettes could lead to nicotine dependence and subsequent use of other tobacco products, regulatory and behavioral interventions are needed to prevent 'gateway' use by adolescent nonsmokers. Campaigns promoting negative images of smokers or FDA bans on sales to youth may help deter use. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - We examined how family communication patterns (FCPs) are associated with frequency of adolescent–parent communication in person, over the phone, via text message, and via email. Adolescents (N = 195) aged 13 to 18 completed an online survey assessing FCPs and frequency of communication methods used with parents. The results revealed that both frequency and method of communication differed by general FCPs; adolescents in higher conformity families reported less frequent text messaging with mothers than adolescents in lower conformity families, and adolescents in higher conversation families (mothers only) and lower conformity families reported more frequent email communication with parents. Results set the stage for future research to further explore the processes and outcomes of adolescent–parent communication through communication technology.

AB  - This study examines factors influencing adoption and use of computer-based voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) phone service and attempts to integrate 2 theoretical approaches: the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the uses and gratifications framework. Using data from an online survey of VoIP users (N = 420), structural equation modeling analyses revealed that perceived ease of use had a significant impact on perceived usefulness. In addition, perceived usefulness had a positive effect on actual VoIP use. The study further discovered that motivations for communication and instrumental use significantly affected perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and actual VoIP use. This study suggests that integration of TAM and uses and gratifications can be fruitful in understanding user acceptance of new communication technologies.

AB  - Technology acceptance theories predict user intentions to use services tailored for organisational needs. However, in this paper, we postulate that the aforementioned theories do not apply when investigating intentions towards the use of mobile data services (MDS), as the latter encompasses supplementary characteristics, such as fun and enjoyment, which are not taken into account under available models of user acceptance. The incorporation of the affective dimension is proposed by reintroducing the Triandis theory of human behaviour to the MDS domain. A web-based survey (N = 219) was conducted to investigate our research hypotheses and validate our model of MDS usage intention. Results showed that the MDS usage intention can be predicted by cognitive and affective factors under the lens of social influences. Additionally, the main antecedents of MDS actual use are perceived usefulness, perceived value and intention to use MDS. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Due to increasing internet and mobile penetration, children in India are at risk of cyberbullying. A survey of 174 middle graders in Delhi showed that, of total, 8% indulged in cyberbullying and 17% reported being victimized by such acts. However, prevalence of in-person bullying, fighting and victimization by either was 16%, 12% and 17% respectively. Males were more likely to bully and fight in-person than females. They were also more likely to be victims of both online and offline aggression. Interwoven modes of bullying along with safe use of technology need to be understood.

AB  - The author explores communication mobility and its implications for those who live in the upper strata of the advanced industrial societies. The professionals who 'phone it in' are scrutinized from a sociological view. So too are today's teens who apparently experience Paris as an opportunity for texting rather than a romantic or political engagement. Mobile connectivity while away from home leaves little time to inquire, as perhaps both Adolph Hitler and Jacques Chirac did in their day, 'Is Paris Burning?' She also examines the digital dustbin awaiting those who are no longer wanted in the brave new technological world. In the process of her examination, she raises important questions about the use of human beings as the opportunities grow to leave emotional work to the infinite patience of robotic pets.

AB  - The wave of the current unprecedented advancements in Information and Communication Technology, which spread in Nigeria, nay Africa is becoming unfathomable has some linguistic implications worthy of philosophical appraisal. The chapter discusses how the new digital milieu is changing human understanding and use of language in social and formal discourse. Contrary to the popular assumptions that the digital communication feat is holistically advantageous, the chapter argues that the advent of digital communication in Nigeria has occasioned unconsciously, more linguistic and social problems on the psyche of Nigerians. Through a careful survey of the style of sending text messages and mails via mobile phones and the Internet, the chapter establishes that Nigerians adopt pragmatic approach, which defies any respect for grammatical and linguistic rules in digital communication. Though, this ideological basis, the chapter argues, might hold some immediate communication effects for the senders and recipients; in spite of these supposed benefits, the chapter argues that the pragmatic approach to digital communication in Nigeria is inadequate. Thus, a case is made in the chapter for a more resonant underlying philosophy of language, which will guide digital communication in contemporary Nigeria.

AB  - Purpose: This paper adopts a response hierarchy model to examine drivers’ intrinsic and extrinsic motivations for using mobile digital television (MDTV) while on the move. Design/methodology/approach: The study used a regional quota sampling method to examine the viewing habits of drivers who have a mobile digital television installed in their vehicles and was carried out in two steps. The first stage had interviews with eight car stereo distributors, and the second stage used a questionnaire to ascertain the viewing habits and content selection of drivers watching TV in their vehicles. Findings: SEM analysis of a survey of 480 MDTV-using drivers in Taiwan revealed an enjoyment-based model of MDTV use since enjoyment has the most significant effect on drivers’ affect, intention to use, and use behavior. Perceived ease of use and subjective norms had a lesser effect. The nonsignificant effect of concentration and perceived risk imply that while drivers enjoy watching MDTV, they do not believe they switch their primary attention from driving to programs. Since drivers do not think they concentrate on watching MDTV, program content has little chance to induce curiosity and increase viewing time, the real communicative effect of watching TV while driving must be sharply discounted. Research limitations/implications: The paper focuses exclusively on use of front-seat MDTV equipment by drivers, and does not attempt to examine MDTV use by other passengers in the same vehicle. Originality/value: This is the first study that has been undertaken of mobile digital television viewers, and the paper will be useful as a reference for those who are developing the mobile digital television market as they work to understand the needs and viewing habits of their audience.

AB  - Teachers in the US have been increasingly adopting mobile devices for teaching, but little research has examined how pre-service teachers perceive mobile device integration in classrooms. To address this issue, the study developed a research model that explained factors affecting pre-service teachers’ intention to use mobile devices and the relationship among the factors. A total of 386 pre-service teachers participated in an online survey, and the model was tested using structural equation modeling. The results showed that 72.5% of variances in pre-service teachers' intention to use mobile devices were explained by perceived usefulness and self-efficacy for technology integration jointly, where perceived usefulness was the strongest predictor. The findings also demonstrated that constructivist beliefs and perceived ease of use indirectly influenced pre-service teachers’ intention to use mobile devices for teaching.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to perform an in situ assessment of office seating habits that influence chair testing and design. Background: Many chair testing parameters were derived decades ago when the average weight of people within the United States was dramatically lower and the office work tasks less computer based. Method: For the study, 51 participants were randomly selected from Brazos Valley, Texas, businesses to participate in 8-hr assessments of office seating habits. Overall results were compared with current chair testing and design assumptions. Data were collected through written survey and through data logging of seat and back contact pressure and duration with the use of the X-SENSOR™ pressure mapping device and software. Additionally, 1 day per participant of caster roll distance was recorded with the use of a caster mounted digital encoder. Participants were grouped by body mass index (BMI) and weight (BMI <35 and weight <102 kg or BMI >35 and weight >102 kg). Results: It was determined that a significant difference did exist between the groups in mean seat time per shift (p < .001), back cycles per shift (p < .002), seat cycles per shift (p < .01), and caster distance rolled per shift (p < .001). Conclusion: Several key parameters and assumptions of current chair test methods and design specifications may no longer be valid for the upper quartile of weight range of the current U.S. population. Application: The data collected in this study will enable engineers to determine whether revision of design standards for testing office seating for both normal weight and extremely obese workers is indicated.

AB  - In recent years, digital learning has been converting from e‐learning to m‐learning because of the significant growth of wireless and mobile computing technologies. Students can learn any time and any where with mobile devices. Consequently, context‐aware ubiquitous learning (u‐learning) is emerging as a new research area. It integrates wireless, mobile and context awareness technologies in order to detect the situation of the learners and provide more seamless adaptive support in the learning process. In this paper, a context‐aware u‐learning environment is developed for learning about campus vegetation in elementary schools based on an innovative approach by employing repertory grid method in designing learning content. In addition, we probe the feasibility of context‐aware u‐learning in courses by soliciting feedback from the students and teachers through interviews and questionnaires. The findings reveal that the environment is capable of enhancing students’ motivation and learning effectiveness. Moreover, it is also capable of reducing the teaching load while enabling better control of class order. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Depression occurring during pregnancy and postpartum (i.e., the perinatal period) is common and associated with adverse outcomes for women and their offspring. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) has been shown to reduce risk for depressive relapse among at-risk individuals generally, and recent adaptations document the efficacy of MBCT among perinatal women specifically. In addition, MBCT, when delivered using a web-based format (Mindful Mood Balance [MMB] program), has demonstrated acceptability and feasibility for at-risk individuals generally. The aim of the present open trial study was to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary outcomes of MMB for use with pregnant women at risk for depressive relapse (N = 37). We predicted that MMB would be feasible and acceptable as assessed by session completion and participation in phone coaching calls, home practice completion, and self-reported satisfaction via questionnaire and interview. We also predicted that women would not demonstrate significant worsening of depression symptom severity during MMB, consistent with our focus on prevention. A brief case example based on a composite of participants is presented to illustrate the MMB structure and content and the phone coaching protocol. Participants demonstrated engagement with the program, reported perceiving benefits in the intended depression prevention targets of MMB, and sustained minimal to mild depressive symptom severity over the course of the program. Given these promising results and the potential benefits of averting depression for women and their families, further development and rigorous testing of MMB among at-risk pregnant women is warranted.

AB  - This study investigates the relevant predictors of customer satisfaction and customer loyalty, and explores the group difference by innovativeness or device type, based on equity theory for emerging devices in the initial market of Korea. The results from an online survey of users of emerging devices and structural equation modeling indicate that utilitarian benefit, hedonic benefit, nonmonetary cost, and alternative attractiveness are significant predictors of customer satisfaction, which in turn affects customer loyalty. Hedonic benefit has a stronger relationship with customer satisfaction for more innovative users and nonmonetary cost has a stronger relationship with customer satisfaction for less innovative users. Nonmonetary cost has a negative relationship with customer satisfaction for netbooks; an additional exploratory analysis produced no such evidence for smartphones. These findings suggest managerial implications for customer loyalty regarding emerging devices. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In this study, we assessed the status of electronic recruitment for U.S. state government employees and analyzed the issues and challenges state governments faced while they implemented e-recruitment systems. All of the 23 state personnel agencies that responded to a phone survey either offered downloadable application forms or allowed candidates to submit applications online. Ten states had adopted options for assessing applicants and selecting job candidates online, but only three states reported that they had adopted online testing. The number of applications received online increased from 2002 to 2003, and the most common implementation challenges that states faced when introducing e-recruitment were budget constraints, technical difficulties, and HR staff adapting to using a new system. While 15 states reported that they evaluated their electronic recruitment system, only three said they measured the cost per hire. Based on the survey responses, we conclude this article by presenting lessons and implications for effectively implementing e-recruitment for state government employees.

AB  - This article explores which antecedents explain intentions to adopt a mobile coaching app. To that end, this study describes a coaching service designed to guide/encourage students throughout their studies in order to validate a new model of planned behavior based on the Technology Acceptance Model and the Goal-Directed Behavioral theory. The methodology included a short qualitative study and an online survey to examine the theoretical model which is based on scales tested in previous studies. The convenience sample is composed of students (Bachelor and Master/MBA) with the results analyzed using structural equation modelling to test the proposed model’s causal structure. The results show different adoption patterns by gender and type of school. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: Previous research on the beneficial effects of physical activity mostly focused on adult samples, although daily physical activity engagement is crucial for children's healthy development. The current study examines associations between preschool-aged children's physical activity, positive affect, and self-regulation during their everyday lives. Both direct and indirect associations between physical activity, positive affect, and self-regulation were investigated. Methods: For seven consecutive days, 98 children aged four to six years wore a tri-axial accelerometer (ActiGraph wGT3X-BT) to assess their moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). During this week, parents rated their children's daily positive affect and self-regulation every evening either by an online questionnaire or via a phone interview. Results: A multilevel structural equation model revealed direct positive associations between daily MVPA and positive affect (within-person level) and between positive affect and self-regulation (within- and between-person levels). There were no direct positive associations between MVPA and self-regulation (within- and between-person level); at the within-person level, a small, unexpected negative association between MVPA and emotional self-regulation was found. MVPA and self-regulation were indirectly related through positive affect on a daily basis. Conclusions: Engaging in more MVPA than usual on a given day was positively associated with preschoolers' daily positive affect, which was associated with higher daily self-regulation levels. Whereas physical activity seems to have short-term associations on a daily basis, positive affect seems to facilitate children's self-regulation skills both intra- and inter-individually.

AB  - The current study used Orlando, Florida as a case study, and investigated whether there are differences between the three meeting planner types (association, corporate, third party) in regard to destination selection attributes. The study further identified attributes that affect future bookings to Orlando. Data were collected from a nationwide survey of meeting planners with a usable sample of 2,388 completed phone surveys and 118 completed online questionnaires. One significant difference was found between the three meeting planner types. This research was performed in the midst of the recent recession and explored the impact the recession has had on planning meetings. Some effects of the economic downturn on the events industry are decreased attendance and more conservative budgets. Most association meeting planners did not cancel or postponed their events, although all planners agree that attendance to their meetings decreased. Third-party planners seemed to be the most sensitive to budget allocations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Comprehension is the goal of reading. However, students often encounter reading difficulties due to the lack of background knowledge and proper reading strategy. Unfortunately, print text provides very limited assistance to one’s reading comprehension through its static knowledge representations such as symbols, charts, and graphs. Integrating digital materials and reading strategy into paper-based reading activities may bring opportunities for learners to make meaning of the print material. In this study, QR codes were adopted in association with mobile technology to deliver supplementary materials and questions to support students’ reading. QR codes were printed on paper prints to provide direct access to digital materials and scaffolded questions. Smartphones were used to scan the printed QR codes to fetch pre-designed digital resources and scaffolded questions over the Internet. A quasi-experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of direct access to the digital materials prepared by the instructor using QR codes and that of scaffolded questioning in improving students’ reading comprehension. The results suggested that direct access to digital resources using QR codes does not significantly influence students’ reading comprehension; however, the reading strategy of scaffolded questioning significantly improves students’ understanding about the text. The survey showed that most students agreed that the integrated print-and-digital-material- based learning system benefits English reading comprehension but may not be as efficient as expected. The implications of the findings shed light on future improvement of the system. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: The 5As for smoking cessation is an evidence-based intervention to aid providers in counseling patients to quit smoking. While most providers 'ask' patients about their tobacco use patterns and 'advise' them to quit, fewer patients report being 'assessed' for their interest in quitting, and even fewer report subsequent 'assistance' in a quit attempt and having follow-up 'arranged'. Purpose: This article describes the design of an implementation study testing a computer tablet intervention to improve provider adherence to the 5As for smoking cessation. Findings will contribute to the existing literature on technology acceptance for addressing addictive behaviors, and how digital tools may facilitate the broader implementation of evidence-based behavioral counseling practices without adversely affecting clinical flow or patient care. Methods: This project develops and tests a computer-facilitated 5As (CF-5As) model that administers the 5As intervention to patients with a computer tablet, then prompts providers to reinforce next steps. During the development phase, 5As' content will be programmed onto computer tablets, alpha and beta-testing of the service delivery model will be done, and pre-intervention interview and questionnaire data will be collected from patients, providers, and clinic staff about 5As fidelity and technology adoption. During the program evaluation phase, a randomized controlled trial comparing a group who receives the CF-5As intervention to one that does not will be conducted to assess 5As fidelity. Using the technology acceptance model, a mixed methods study of contextual and human factors influencing both 5As and technology adoption will also be conducted. Conclusions: Technology is increasingly being used in clinical settings. A technological tool that connects patients, providers, and clinic staff to facilitate the promotion of behavioral interventions such as smoking cessation may provide an innovative platform through which to efficiently and effectively implement evidence-based practices.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the current clinical practice in approaches to bimodal programming in the United States. To be specific, if clinicians are recommending bimodal stimulation, who programs the hearing aid in the bimodal condition, and what method is used for programming the hearing aid? Method: An 11-question online survey was created and sent via email to a comprehensive list of cochlear implant programming centers in the United States. The survey was sent to 360 recipients. Results: Respondents in this study represented a diverse group of clinical settings (response rate: 26%). Results indicate little agreement about who programs the hearing aids, when they are programmed, and how they are programmed in the bimodal condition. Analysis of small versus large implant centers indicated small centers are less likely to add a device to the contralateral ear. Conclusions: Although a growing number of cochlear implant recipients choose to wear a hearing aid on the contralateral ear, there is inconsistency in the current clinical approach to bimodal programming. These survey results provide evidence of large variability in the current bimodal programming practices and indicate a need for more structured clinical recommendations and programming approaches.

AB  - The present research attempted to develop a multidimensional brand trust scale and provide an alternative measurement model of brand trust. The proposed measurement model was tested with a set of data collected through a large-scale survey conducted by a professional research firm in China using the Central Location Test approach. The respondents consisted of 1,343 Chinese consumers who had adequate experience with the products we investigated. To reduce possible sample biases, respondents were recruited in multiple cities in different regions of China, including Beijing in the north, Shanghai in the middle, Guanzhou in the south, and Chengdo, an inland city in Sichuan Province. Six products were chosen to be tested in this study: detergent, beer, digital camera, laptop computer, car and wireless phone services. We chose to test the model with multiple products in the hope that the multidimensional scale would be applicable across product categories. The products were selected based on a pretest involving 88 students at a business school in Beijing. The instrument used in the main study contains the 12 items measuring brand trust and its two dimensions. The results have important implications. Because brand trust can be measured at different levels, researchers must be cautious in selecting a particular scale to use in the future. As discussed above, it is important to be clear about the level of trust in which one is interested since failure to distinguish measurement levels may impair measurement accuracy and cause model misspecification. For instance, it is not unusual to find measurement scales in marketing literature that contain both measures of overall trust and measures tapping into specific dimensions. The practice of using items indicating specific dimensions as direct measures of the construct of higher abstraction may create a problem of lack of unidimensionality if the final scale in fact taps into multiple content domains. Alternatively, it may result in a unidimensional construct with a content domain so restrictive that they actually measure a construct that is not of general interest.

AB  - Strategic, high quality HIV testing services (HTS) delivery is an essential step towards reaching the end of AIDS by 2030. We conducted HTS Data Use workshops in five African countries to increase data use for strategic program decision-making. Feedback was collected on the extent to which workshop skills and tools were applied in practice and to identify future capacity-building needs. We later conducted six semistructured phone interviews with workshop planning teams and sent a web-based survey to 92 past participants. The HTS Data Use workshops provided accessible tools that were readily learned by most respondents. While most respondents reported increased confidence in interpreting data and frequency of using such tools over time, planning team representatives indicated ongoing needs for more automated tools that can function across data systems. To achieve ambitious global HIV/AIDS targets, national decision makers may continue to seek tools and skill-building opportunities to monitor programs and identify opportunities to refine strategies.

AB  - This paper examines channel choice and the digital divide in Egyptian electronic government or e-government. Citizens have access to a variety of service delivery channels when they initiate contact with their government, ranging from e-government to more traditional channels such as the phone and in-person visits to a government office. This paper examines the extent of use of both contact channels for citizens and the impact of the digital divide on channel use. A public opinion survey of Egyptian citizens was analyzed, and the results showed that there was a digital divide in the use of e-government by citizens. The digital divide also extended to other contact channels such as the phone and when citizens used multiple contact channels for public service delivery. The results of this study imply that for the development of e-government, especially in the context of a developing country such as Egypt, policy-makers need to understand that e-government is one of many channels that citizens can use when they initiate contact with their government. The results of this study should encourage policy-makers to recognize the importance of public service delivery in a multichannel environment.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to provide evidence regarding the comparability of results provided by two survey methods—a random phone survey and a nonrandom online survey—using the derived importance–performance approach to examine service satisfaction data at the local level. Specifically, we measure whether nonprobability opt-in online survey results produce results that are convergent or divergent to random phone survey results. The findings show that the phone and online survey techniques yield divergent results when simple univariate statistical techniques are employed but produce similar results when the data are analyzed using the more advanced derived importance approach. Though preliminary, the findings suggest that recent advances in the analysis of satisfaction survey data might have the possibility to offset the methodological drawbacks of nonrandom survey techniques such as opt-in online questionnaires. Because of the cost and resource implications of the use of each survey technique, the results hold potentially important lessons for researchers and administrators interested in understanding the costs and benefits of using various survey methods to assess satisfaction with municipal services.

AB  - This article compares Global Assessment of Function (GAF) and Client Satisfaction Survey scores for clients receiving either face-to-face or online counselling. Clients were assessed by phone and then assigned to one of the two modalities. Analyses of variance were conducted with α = 0.05, to examine differences between counselling modalities. No significant differences were found for degree of change in GAF between assessment and closing between the two modalities. Some differences were found in Client Satisfaction Scores. Implications for screening and social work practice are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Despite the ubiquitous use of new communication technologies, gaps in our knowledge remain regarding who is likely to rely on particular technologies and potential ramifications of these forms of communication on individuals’ relationships and adjustment. In an online survey, 211 college students reported on their use of electronic communication with a parent who they identified as their closest family member. Results indicated that students who report more frequent phone conversations with parents also report more satisfying, intimate, and supportive parental relationships, but those students who use a social-networking site to communicate with parents report higher levels of loneliness, anxious attachment, as well as conflict within the parental relationship. The findings offer new evidence on how electronic communication technology with parents is related to adjustment in college students. Our study also suggests that further research is needed using longitudinal designs to understand better young adults’ use of technology to communicate in today’s society.

AB  - Background: Routine monitoring of depression symptoms and suicide risk is essential for appropriate treatment planning and risk management, but not well implemented by clinicians. We developed a brief online monitoring tool to address this issue. Aims: To investigate whether the online tool can feasibly improve monitoring; whether it is acceptable and useful for young people and their clinicians; and to determine whether a shorter tool could be implemented. Method: In a naturalistic longitudinal cohort study, 101 young people with depression completed the online tool on a tablet, prior to their consultation. Their results were immediately available to their clinician. Clients and clinicians answered questionnaires about acceptability and usefulness. Results: The tool was feasible to implement. Young people and clinicians found the tool acceptable and useful for understanding symptoms and risk. A brief three-item suicidal ideation screening measure correlated well with a validated measure of suicidal ideation. Conclusion: The online tool facilitates the quick exchange of key information about suicide risk, allowing clinicians to immediately address this. This level of responsiveness is likely to improve treatment outcomes. The brief version allows full integration into clinical practice to support clinicians managing those at risk of suicide.

AB  - The study examined the use of computer-mediated communication (CMC) among individuals involved in a conflict sparked by the appointment of an administrator as president-designate of Gallaudet University in 2006. CMC was defined as forms of communication used for transmitting (sharing) information through networks with digital devices. There were 662 survey respondents. Respondents reported overwhelmingly (98%) that they used CMC to communicate. Students and alumni reported CMC use in larger proportions than any other group. The favorite devices among all respondents were Sidekicks, stationary computers, and laptops. Half of all respondents also reported using some form of video device. Nearly all reported using e-mail; respondents also identified Web surfing, text messaging, and blogging as popular CMC activities. The authors plan another article reporting on computer and electronic technology use as a mechanism connecting collective identity to social movements.

AB  - Incorporation of tablet computers (TCs) into patient assessment may facilitate safe and secure data collection. We evaluated the usefulness and acceptability of a TC as an electronic self-report symptom assessment instrument. Research Electronic Data Capture Web-based application supported data capture. Information was collected and disseminated in real time and a structured format. Completed questionnaires were printed and given to the physician before the patient visit. Most participants completed the survey without assistance. Completion rate was 100%. The median global quality of life was high for all. More than half reported pain. Based on Edmonton Symptom Assessment System, the top 3 most common symptoms were tiredness, anxiety, and decreased well-being. Patient and physician acceptability for these quick and useful TC-based surveys was excellent. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Recently a number of studies appeared that operationalised coolness and explored its relation to digital products. Literature suggests that perceived coolness is another factor of user experience, and this adds to an existing explosion of dimensions related to aesthetics, hedonic quality, pragmatic quality, attractiveness, etc. A critical challenge highlighted in prior research is to study the relationships among those factors and so far, no studies have empirically examined the relationship between coolness and other established user experience factors. In this paper, we address this challenge by presenting two studies one that focuses on factors from two cool questionnaires, and one that compares them against existing User eXperience (UX) factors. Our findings show that factors from the two cool questionnaires converge and they also converge to existing, established UX factors. Thus, 11 distinct cool and UX factors converge into 5 for the case of mobile devices. Our findings are important for researchers, as we demonstrate through a validated model that coolness is part of UX research, as well as for practitioners, by developing a questionnaire that can reliably measure both perceived inner and outer coolness as well as the overall coolness judgement based on 5 factors and 21 items.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2019-20543-001[/rid]). The Autism impact measure (AIM) is a caregiver-reported questionnaire assessing autism symptom frequency and impact in children, previously shown to have good test–retest reliability, convergent validity and structural validity. This study extended previous work by exploring the AIM’s ability to discriminate between ‘known-groups’ of children, and estimating thresholds for clinically important responses. Data were collected online and electronically on computer and mobile devices; hence, it was also possible to confirm other psychometric properties of the AIM in this format. This study provides confirmatory and additional psychometric validation of the AIM. The AIM offers a valid, quick and inexpensive method for caregivers to report core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) including communication deficits, difficulties with social interactions and repetitive behaviors.

AB  - Context: Previous research has indicated that despite awareness of the current literature on the recommended prevention and care of exertional heat stroke (EHS), certified athletic trainers (ATs) acknowledge failure to follow those recommendations. Objective: To investigate the current knowledge, attitudes, and practices of ATs regarding the recognition and treatment of EHS. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Online survey. Patients or Other Participants: We obtained a random sample of e-mail addresses for 1000 high school and collegiate ATs and contacted these individuals with invitations to participate. A total of 498 usable responses were received, for a 25% response rate. Main Outcome Measure(s): The survey instrument evaluated ATs' knowledge and actual practice regarding EHS and included 29 closed-ended Likert scale questions (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree), 2 closed-ended questions rated on a Likert scale (1 = lowest value, 9 = greatest value), 8 open-ended questions, and 7 demographic questions. We focused on the open-ended and demographic questions. Results: Although most ATs (77.1%) have read the current National Athletic Trainers' Association position statement on heat illness, only 18.6% used rectal thermometers to assess core body temperature to recognize EHS, and 49.7% used cold-water immersion to treat EHS. Athletic trainers perceived rectal thermometers as the most valid temperature assessment device when compared with other assessment devices (P ≤ .05), but they used oral thermometers as the primary assessment tool (49.1%). They identified cold-water immersion as the best cooling method (P ≤ .05), even though they used other means to cool a majority of the time (50.3%). Conclusions: The ATs surveyed have sound knowledge of the correct means of EHS recognition and treatment. However, a significant portion of these ATs reported using temperature assessment devices that are invalid with athletes exercising in the heat. Furthermore, they reported using cooling treatment methods that have inferior cooling rates. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Studies point to a relationship between fantasy sports/daily fantasy sports (DFS) play and gambling behavior. However, little is known about the nature of those relationships, particularly regarding the development of gambling problems. This study investigates the nature, frequency, and preferences of gambling behavior as well as problem gambling severity and comorbid conditions among DFS players. Data were collected from an epidemiologic survey of 3634 New Jersey residents on gambling and leisure activities. Participants were contacted by phone (land-line and cell) and online to obtain a representative, cross-sectional sample of non-institutionalized adults, aged 18 years or older. Excluding non-gamblers, the remaining 2146 participants, included in these analyses, indicated they had either played DFS (n = 299) or had gambled but not played DFS (1847) in the past year. Univariate comparisons and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the most significant characteristics and predictors of DFS players. Overall, a higher number of gambling activities, high frequency gambling, male gender, and reports of suicidal thoughts in the past year were most predictive of DFS players. Being Hispanic (vs. Caucasian) and/or single (vs. married or living with a partner) also doubled the odds of DFS play. Findings suggest that DFS players are characterized by high gambling frequency and problem severity and comorbid problems, notably suicidal ideation. Future research should examine the motivations and possible etiological sub-types of DFS players and the nature and course of DFS play, particularly in relation to gambling behavior and the development of gambling and other problems.

AB  - Rationale: As therapeutic interventions are being developed utilising telehealth and mobile phones, it is important to understand how substance‐dependent individuals will respond to offers of online assistance. Objectives: The present paper considered the following: (1) how decision‐making style is associated with use and dependence upon commonly used stimulants and (2) how it influences behavioural responses to electronic offers of further information about these drugs. Method: An online survey examined patterns of nicotine and caffeine use, administered Severity of Dependence Scales for caffeine and nicotine and assessed decision‐making style using the Melbourne Decision Making Questionnaire and mood using the Kessler Distress Scale. Upon completing these scales, the 181 participants with a mean age of 28.14 years were offered further information online. Results: Stimulant dependence was associated with psychological distress. Caffeine dependence was linked to hypervigilance (panic). Decisional self‐esteem varied with stimulant dependence and Kessler Distress Scale score. Participants with high decisional self‐esteem declined electronic offers of further information. Conclusion: Confidence rather than defensive avoidance was a factor in reducing information‐seeking behaviours on the Internet. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Modern technology allows for surveying through different media (e.g. Internet, mobile phones, tablets), which may influence the quality of collected data with additional effects due to the survey mode and should be pretested with the purpose of avoiding effects that would deteriorate the quality of collected data. In the present study, we analysed the technological development of surveying tools by testing the applicability of cognitive interviews on several different survey modes. We focused on the importance of the cognitive interviewer and the effect of reducing their degree of involvement on the quality of the interview results. We carried out personal interviews, interviews using voice-over-Internet protocol, interviews using programs for instant messaging, and web-based interviews; these enabled us to analyse the quality of each survey mode and recognize their advantages and deficiencies. Through the comparison of these modes and their assigned technique, we showed that the role of a cognitive interviewer is important for the quality of interviews regardless of the degree of their involvement in the survey process. However, the requirement for the pretesting situation to resemble the actual final process leads to a necessity to develop new, enhanced approaches to cognitive interviewing on trending survey modes.

AB  - Objectives: We described and evaluated the 2009–2010 Pennsylvania Influenza Sentinel School Monitoring System, a voluntary sentinel network of schools that report data on school absenteeism and visits to the school nurse for influenza-like illness (ILI). Methods: Participating schools provided daily absenteeism and ILI data on a weekly basis through an online survey. We used participation and weekly response rates to determine acceptability, timeliness, and simplicity. We assessed representativeness by comparing participating schools with nonparticipating schools. We compared monitoring system data with statewide reports of laboratory-confirmed influenza. Results: Of the 3244 Pennsylvania public schools, 367 (11%) enrolled in the system. On average, 79% of enrolled schools completed the survey each week. Although the peak week of elevated absenteeism coincided with the peak of statewide laboratory-confirmed influenza cases, the correlation between absenteeism and state data was nonsignificant (correlation coefficient = 0.10; P = .56). Trends in ILI correlated significantly with state data (correlation coefficient = 0.67; P < .001). Conclusions: The school-based sentinel system is a simple, acceptable, reliable device for tracking absenteeism and ILI in schools. Further analyses are necessary to determine the comparative value of this system and other influenza surveillance systems. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This paper’s premise is that technology has the potential to support the elicitation, expression and communication of positive thoughts. However, its success depends on understanding and incorporating appropriate strategies for interactive system design and development. Following in the positive psychology tradition, this paper presents two co-design studies investigating how positive thoughts can be mediated and shared. These studies involved approximately 50 participants, using paper-based questioning techniques and social–online tools that captured 151 contributions on what thoughts people like to share. The collected data demonstrated the potential for designing systems based on a prefixbased elicitation of positive emotions. Analysis of participants’ contributions suggests that various messages of a predominantly positive nature can be harnessed, emphasizing the importance of immediacy and situatedness in expression. Moreover, the analysis resulted in a set of design considerations for the design and development of positive expressive technologies. These considerations were used to develop a mobile application called PosiPost Me (Mobile Internet Edition) that allows users to create and share positive thoughts at any time and place. In this way, this research sets an exemplar of a design process for positive communicative systems while building on research in positive psychology, human–computer interaction and cognitive ergonomics. Relevance to industry: The studies conducted showed the feasibility of proposed approach and opens new avenues for technologies aimed at positive communication and wellbeing in the mobile environment. It also offers a set of design considerations to support designers in creating such positive expressive technologies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study addresses why Japanese teenagers participate in mobile-based word-of-mouth (WOM) campaigns. It is posited that commitment to the promoted brand, relationship with the mobile device, and group-person connectivity act as antecedents of two primary gratifications of the campaign, entertainment value and purposive value, which in turn determine the direction and strength of the attitude-intention-behavior chain. A 'real' mobile campaign was used as stimulus. Based on a random sampling method, 22,500 structured questionnaires were sent to young consumers, 13-18 years old, via mobile device. Our data fit the proposed model fairly well, and all hypothesized paths are supported. There are significant differences in the strength of the paths between teenagers who learned of the campaign from non-WOM sources (i.e., content-based Web sites and e-mail magazines) versus WOM sources (pass-along e-mail and direct referral). In closing, theoretical and managerial implications are discussed and important limitations are recognized. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Authentic videos are always motivational for foreign language learners. According to the findings of many empirical studies, subtitled L2 videos are particularly useful for foreign language learning. Although there are many authentic English videos available on the Internet, most of these videos do not have subtitles. If subtitles can be added to videos, EFL students might better understand the video content and pick up more vocabulary items. To help EFL students make better use of authentic videos, an automatic video and transcript synchronization system called SynctoLearn was developed. The SynctoLearn system uses speech recognition technologies to automatically synchronize voices in audios and videos with their respective transcripts. Two studies were conducted in order to assess the effectiveness of this listening tool and investigate EFL learners’ perception toward this device. In the first study, two college classes at similar proficiency levels were divided in two groups. One group viewed the synchronized video and another viewed the same video without any synchronized subtitles. The group that watched the synchronized video outperformed the other group in summarizing the key points of the video. In the second study, two college EFL classes used the SynctoLearn website for a whole semester and were invited to fill in a questionnaire. Based on the survey results, students indicated that they enjoyed watching synchronized videos. They regarded the design of the SynctoLearn system positively and particularly lauded the options that allowed them to click and replay any video segments and show/hide the subtitles at any time. Students, however, suggested that the video quality and subtitle presentation can be further improved. Moreover, additional learning support such as online dictionaries can be included in the system. The results of the experiment and the survey indicate that the SynctoLearn tool, which provides synchronized subtitles, can be used as a supporting tool to help EFL students reduce their cognitive loads and anxiety levels when tackling authentic videos. The findings and the technologies used in this article should be useful for teachers and researchers who want to use or develop similar tools for foreign language learning.

AB  - Although a number of instruments have been used to measure Internet skills in nationally representative surveys, there are several challenges with the measures available: incompleteness and over-simplification, conceptual ambiguity, and the use of selfreports. Here, we aim to overcome these challenges by developing a set of reliable measures for use in research, practice, and policy evaluations based on a strong conceptual framework. To achieve this goal, we carried out a literature review of skillsrelated studies to develop the initial Internet skills framework and associated instrument. After the development of this instrument, we used a three-fold approach to test the validity and reliability of the latent skill constructs and the corresponding items. The first step consisted of cognitive interviews held in both the UK and the Netherlands. Based on the cognitive interview results, we made several amendments to the proposed skill items to improve clarity. The second step consisted of a pilot survey of digital skills, both in the UK and in the Netherlands. During the final step, we examined the consistency of the five Internet skill scales and their characteristics when measured in a representative sample survey of Dutch Internet users. The result is a theoretical, empirically and cross-nationally consistent instrument consisting of five types of Internet skills: operational, navigation information, social, creative, and mobile.

AB  - This paper studies the similarities and differences among the views of school principals and teachers regarding a mobile computer lab (MCL) initiative implemented in 1,591 public schools in Chile. It also characterizes the aspects in which their views diverge. A mixed methods study was carried out in two stages: first, a quantitative stage, where a self-administered (web-based) questionnaire was sent to the schools; and second, a qualitative stage, where a case study was conducted with three schools. The results show a greater convergence of the teachers’ and school principals’ views regarding the contribution of ICT resources to teaching, with more divergence when it comes to the implementation process. More specifically, these differences were related to two points: (1) how appropriate the conditions were for using and learning how to use the new resources within the context of the school, and (2) who should be held accountable for integrating ICT resources within the school organization. Furthermore, the qualitative results revealed that school principals only had vague information on the pedagogical integration of the MCLs in their schools. These findings suggest that in order to have more effective technology integration processes in schools, a closer presence of school leaders in the teachers’ everyday pedagogical activities is required.

AB  - This article presents results on how students became engaged and motivated when using digital storytelling in knowledge creation in Finland, Greece and California. The theoretical framework is based on sociocultural theories. Learning is seen as a result of dialogical interactions between people, substances and artefacts. This approach has been used in the creation of the Global Sharing Pedagogy (GSP) model for the empirical study of student levels of engagement in learning twenty-first century skills. This model presents a set of conceptual mediators for student-driven knowledge creation, collaboration, networking and digital literacy. Data from 319 students were collected using follow-up questionnaires after the digital storytelling project. Descriptive statistical methods, correlations, analysis of variance and regression analysis were used. The mediators of the GSP model strongly predicted student motivation and enthusiasm as well as their learning outcomes. The digital storytelling project, using the technological platform Mobile Video Experience (MoViE), was very successful in teaching twenty-first century skills.

AB  - We administered an anonymous 1-page survey to 55 consecutive patients attending their first appointment at the Nepean Anxiety Disorders Clinic in Penrith, N.S.W., Australia. The survey asked respondents to rate their preferences for 5 forms of therapy delivery: individual face-to-face therapy, group face-to-face therapy, bibliotherapy (where therapy is exclusively provided by means of books and reading materials that are posted to patients), online therapy without therapist contact and online therapy with weekly therapist phone contact. The results of our survey suggest that patients overwhelmingly preferred individual face-to-face therapy to all other delivery options. Importantly, this does not appear to be a consequence of a lack of basic and affirmative information about the alternative therapy modalities, given that such information was provided by the survey.

AB  - Survey research has long grappled with the concept of survey mode preference: the idea that a respondent may prefer to participate in one survey mode over another. This article experimentally examines the effect of mode preference on response, contact, and cooperation rates; mode choice; and data collection efficiency. Respondents to a 2008 telephone survey (n = 1,811; AAPOR RR3 = 38 percent) were asked their mode preference for future survey participation. These respondents were subsequently followed up in 2009 with two independent survey requests. The first follow-up survey request was another telephone survey (n = 548; AAPOR RR2 = 55.5 percent). In the second follow-up survey (n = 565; AAPOR RR2 = 46.0 percent), respondents were randomly assigned to one of four mode treatments: Web only, mail only, Web followed by mail, and mail followed by Web. We find that mode preference predicts participation in Web and phone modes, cooperation in phone mode (where contact and cooperation can be disentangled), and the selection of a mode when given the option of two modes. We find weak and mixed evidence about the relationship between mode preference and reduction of field effort. We discuss the important implications these findings have for mixed mode surveys.

AB  - Context: Given the power and pervasiveness of technology, this paper considers whether it can help doctors to access, use and share knowledge and thus contribute to their ability to uphold the part of the Hippocratic Oath concerned with respecting ‘the hard‐won scientific gains of those physicians in whose steps I walk’ and sharing ‘such knowledge as is mine with those who are to follow’. How technology supports connections between doctors and knowledge is considered by focusing on the use of mobile technology in the workplace and Web 2.0 tools. Methods: Sfard's ‘acquisition’ and ‘participation’ models are employed to help develop an understanding of what these uses of technology mean for learning and knowledge sharing. Discussion: The employment of technology is not neutral in its effects. Issues relate to knowledge ownership, information overload, quality control and interpretations attached to the use of mobile devices in the workplace. These issues raise deeper questions about the nature of knowledge and social theory and socio‐material research questions about the effect of technology on workplace learning. Conclusion: Although the empirical and theoretical evidence presented shows how technology has clear potential to contribute both to accessing evidence and sharing knowledge, there is need for further research that applies theoretical frameworks to the analysis of the impact of technology on workplace learning.

AB  - This study tests two models of perceptual disconfirmation. Perceptual disconfirmation occurs when individuals have a negative expectation regarding their future conversation partners’ demeanor, but after conversing with and influencing their partners’ behavior, individuals’ assessment of their partners’ demeanor becomes more positive. This effect is, so far, novel to computer-mediated communication: When individuals with similar expectancies get acquainted using phone or face-to-face channels their negative preinteraction expectancies persist and assessments remain unchanged. This experiment explored the extent to which questions and disclosures, and partners’ disclosive responses, mediated perceptual disconfirmation. Individuals were led to believe that a dyadic conversation partner was either in a bad mood (negative and malleable expectation) or had a bad personality (negative and nonmalleable expectation). After a 30-min online conversation to get acquainted, perceptual disconfirmation emerged, although the verbal strategies did not mediate the effect. This study raises new questions about the process by which individuals who have negative expectancies of their future conversation partners defy these negative expectations and shift their attitudes to become more positive online.

AB  - Online environments can be programmed to make use of movable, drag & drop objects. A drag & drop object is a geometric figure (which may contain text, pictures, or both) whose position on the screen can be changed by the user. Typically, a user accomplishes this by (a) moving the cursor over the object with a mouse or other pointing device, (b) holding down button that 'grabs' the object, (c) dragging the object to a new location by sliding the mouse or pointing device, and (d) dropping the object at the new location by releasing the button. Drag & drop objects can be useful in several self-administered measurement domains of interest to social scientists; these include visual analogue scales (VASs; Couper, Tourangeau, & Conrad, 2006), ranking tasks (Neubarth, 2008; Thurstone, 1931), magnitude scaling (Lodge, 1981), ideal scaling (Barrett, 2005; Ryf, 2007), preference point maps (Harris Interactive, 2007), and various grouping or sorting tasks (Coxon, 1999). Even preference statements (Hensher, Rose, & Greene, 2005), choice analyses (Hensher et al., 2005), and the measurement of similarities or dissimilarities (Bijmolt & Wedel, 1995; Borg & Groenen, 2005) can benefit from using movable objects instead of simple hypertext markup language (HTML) forms. This chapter explains how to implement a measurement framework for movable objects in Web questionnaires, how to define objects that can be dragged across all or predefined sections of the screen, and how to process the x- and y-coordinates of the objects. I provide code that restricts the range of the drag & drop objects to a predefined area. I also provide a function that allows one to align the objects smoothly after they are dropped. Finally, I suggest some practical applications for the movable object method and provide some further resources. This chapter will be useful to researchers who want to use drag & drop functionality in their Web research. It will also be useful for those who want to learn more about the technical basics of the document object model (DOM; see Keith, 2005, and Marini, 2002). The DOM allows objects to be moved and their positions to be saved into a data set. The chapter will also be useful to those who want to learn about the research possibilities afforded by drag & drop functionality. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Although research interest in post adoption behavior of ICT (Information and Communication Technology)users increases from year to year, few studies examine how motivational factors and service type influence post adoption behavior. This study investigates the antecedents of post adoption behavior in the Mobile Data Services (MDS) domain. The study conducted a nationwide online survey in Korea to verify the proposed research model that includes motivational factors and service type. Two extrinsic motivation factors (post usefulness and post monetary value) and two intrinsic motivation factors (post ease of use and post enjoyment) are the main components of the motivational factors. The results of the study reveal that the motivational factors and service type influence the post adopter type in the MDS context. The findings of this study help provide guidelines for MDS providers to select a target market and to devise a strategy that meets the stated objectives of the selected market.

AB  - This study developed a Mobile Plant Learning System (MPLS) that provides instructors with the ways and means to facilitate student learning in an elementary-school-level botany course. The MPLS represented in this study was implemented to address problems that arise with the use of a didactic approach to teaching and learning botany, as is typically used in elementary schools in Taiwan. To extend opportunities for learning beyond the classroom, this study used personal digital assistants (PDAs) equipped with the MPLS, which provided both teachers and students access to plant information while in the field. A quasi-experimental research design was used to investigate the effectiveness of using the MPLS to support student learning. The responses to questionnaires and interviews indicate that students valued the outdoor learning activities made possible by use of the PDA and its functions. Pre- and post-test results demonstrated that students also benefitted academically from the use of the MPLS and the PDA. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study sought to overcome some of the methodological limitations in previous studies and clarify the role of attachment in the associations between texting and romantic relationship satisfaction. Specifically, a new, relative measure of texting usage was created to estimate the share of texting in communication compared to other channels (e.g., face-to-face, phone, and etc.), in addition to using the traditional, absolute measure of texting usage (i.e., the number of texts sent to partners). A sample of 395 participants completed an online survey regarding texting behavior. Background variables were controlled for in all analyses, particularly the physical distance between partners, which was often overlooked in previous research. The results suggested that texting share showed positive links with both attachment dimensions and a negative link with relationship satisfaction, whereas the sheer volume of texts had little association with attachment dimensions or satisfaction.

AB  - Objective: To determine the efficacy of portable electronic aids such as personal digital assistants (PDAs), pagers or mobile phones for patients with cognitive deficits by means of a systematic review. The usability of these aids is also briefly discussed. Data sources: PubMed, CINAHL, PsychINFO, EMBASE and MEDLINE were searched up to February 2009. The references of identified and relevant articles were scanned to find additional relevant titles. Review methods: Papers referring to ‘electronic aids’, ‘cognition’ and ‘brain injury’ were included. The population had to be adult and have cognitive impairments as a result of acquired brain injury. Outcome measures were change in cognitive or occupational performance or the level of participation in daily life. The criteria of Cicerone et al. were used to evaluate the quality of the retrieved studies. Results: Twenty-eight papers presenting 25 studies were reviewed. The total number of participants was 423. Most identified papers described case reports or non-randomized clinical trials. Only one randomized controlled trial was identified, in which the NeuroPage proved effective in supporting prospective memory. Other kinds of assistive technology such as PDAs and voice recorders showed positive results in supporting retrospective and prospective memory. Conclusion: The efficacy of assistive technology in general is not yet sufficiently studied in randomized controlled trials, although promising results has been reported. Furthermore, several survey studies established that both potential users and clinicians have optimistic expectations about the usability of assistive technology.

AB  - Through an experimental design, this article tests the efficiency of various recruitment strategies in a probability sample for a web panel. In order to test the five hypotheses, contact phone, contact SMS, incentives, sponsorship and social proof, the authors conducted a recruitment experiment for a web panel. Five samples each consisting of 500 individuals were drawn from a random sample of 50,000 individuals on the Danish Civil Registration System. Web panels offer a number of advantages and possibilities in studies of public opinion. Recruiting members for such web panels can, however, be a difficult task, and there is a need for more knowledge about the efficiency of different recruitment strategies. The recruitment experiment for our web panel shows that telephone recruitment yields higher recruitment rates than both postal letter and SMS recruitment.

AB  - Comments on an article by J. K. Pepper et al. (see record [rid]2013-02132-004[/rid]). Pepper et al. present the first study of a national sample of U.S. male adolescents' awareness, use, and susceptibility to using e-cigarettes. The 228 participants were sons of parents recruited to participate in an online panel. Pepper et al found high awareness of e-cigarettes—67%—but little use; < 1% had tried them. Of even greater importance, 18% of the sample endorsed being susceptible to trying e-cigarettes, and this was much higher (74%) among participants who reported current smoking. To date, only two studies of national data sets have provided a glimpse into awareness and use of e-cigarettes, and both were among adults. The high rate of awareness among youth is concerning, particularly because the literature raises concerns about e-cigarette products with regard to ingredient and device safety. Given the dearth of empirical research on e-cigarette products and who may be using them, the Pepper et al article makes an important contribution toward understanding how youth are responding to their availability. In their multivariate analysis, being a current smoker was strongly associated with willingness to try e-cigarettes. When the analysis was limited to nonsmoking participants, holding negative beliefs about the typical smoker was associated with less willingness to try e-cigarettes. These findings suggest that e-cigarettes may be perceived by adolescents as symbolically and functionally similar to tobacco cigarettes. Although these findings are limited by a male-only sample, known predictors of initiation of cigarette smoking, such as sensation seeking and positive smoking expectancies, may be relevant factors to examine in future research investigating e-cigarette use among adolescents.

AB  - While recent evidence has pointed to disturbances in emotion regulation strategy use in schizophrenia, few studies have examined how these regulation strategies relate to emotionality and social behavior in daily life. Using ecological momentary assessment (EMA), we investigated the relationship between emotion regulation, emotional experience, and social interaction in the daily lives of individuals with schizophrenia. Participants (N = 30) used mobile phones to complete online questionnaires reporting their daily emotional experience and social interaction. Participants also completed self-report measures of habitual emotion regulation. Hierarchical linear modeling revealed that self-reported use of cognitive reappraisal and savoring of emotional experiences were related to greater positive emotion in daily life. In contrast, self-reported suppression was related to greater negative emotion, reduced positive emotion, and reduced social interaction in daily life. These findings suggest that individual differences in habitual emotion regulation strategy usage have important relationships to everyday emotional and social experiences in schizophrenia.

AB  - Objective: The study aims were to identify: i.) energy drink (ED), caffeine tablet, and caffeine intranasal spray use amongst a sample who report drug use, and ii.) the association between ED use frequency and demographic profile, drug use, hazardous drinking, and wellbeing. Method: Participants (n = 74,864) who reported drug use completed the online 2014 Global Drug Survey. They provided data on demographics, ED use, and alcohol and drug use, completed the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and Personal Wellbeing Index (PWI), and reported whether they wished to reduce alcohol use. Results: Lifetime ED, caffeine tablet and intranasal caffeine spray use were reported by 69.2%, 24.5% and 4.9%. Median age of ED initiation was 16 years. For those aged 16–37, median years using EDs increased from 4 to 17 years of consumption, where it declined thereafter. Greater ED use frequency was associated with: being male; under 21 years of age; studying; and past year caffeine tablet/intranasal spray, tobacco, cannabis, amphetamine, MDMA, and cocaine use. Past year, infrequent (1–4days) and frequent (≥5days) past month ED consumers reported higher AUDIT scores and lower PWI scores than lifetime abstainers; past month consumers were less likely to report a desire to reduce alcohol use. Conclusions: ED use is part of a complex interplay of drug use, alcohol problems, and poorer personal wellbeing, and ED use frequency may be a flag for current/future problems. Prospective research is required exploring where ED use fits within the trajectory of other alcohol and drug use. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - There is a growing understanding that the 'power' of information technology is as much about its ability to judiciously filter out some information streams, its ability to help us assimilate data and ease cognitive load, as it is about accessing new streams and accruing greater quantities of data. Powerful digital technologies are as much about selectivity as they are about speed, capacity, or sensitivity. It is in the midst of that popular recognition that the iPhone (and perhaps the Apple brand in general) has emerged as an icon. The conventional wisdom that it 'just works'—its interoperability and functional resilience, the intuitive design of its interface, its visual and tactile harmonies—ameliorates a gnawing mass anxiety rooted in complexity. It is all too easy to overlook that the iPhone is not just an apparatus but an assemblage, a nexus of social, institutional, and material relations 'made concrete.' What proportion of the cost of the iPhone (real or effective, externalized or otherwise) is incurred not in the labor of its production and design or the raw materials of its physical components but in its attendant 'intangibles'—licenses, intellectual property, storage capacity, and bandwidth? Does the widening gulf between our pedestrian experience of such devices and their arcane 'insides'—arguably, some of the very complexities they are designed to alleviate—warrant analytic or political concern? Further, what is the cultural significance of this 'iceberg' quality, the fact that a growing proportion of our everyday experience is opaque to the casual observer, residing 'beneath the surface' of lay scrutiny and held fast within a dense technosocial matrix? This chapter considers these questions through what in many ways is a quite traditional anthropological approach. In particular, the author analyzes three artifacts of digital culture and their realization within the iPhone and its users and principal competitors: the 'end-user licensing agreement,' or EULA; the coder-decoder, or 'codec'; and the 'application programming interface,' or API.

AB  - Objective: As a Web application for speech training, e-learning-based speech therapy (EST) is assumed to have potential for neurological patients who aim at independent speech training in their home environment. This article reports a case study of a patient with dysarthric speech due to Parkinson's disease (PD) who enrolled in a 4-week intensive speech training through EST. The primary goal was to investigate the feasibility and the potential efficacy of EST as a Web application for speech training in dysarthric patients with PD. Materials and Methods: The participant used EST, following a speech training program containing parts of the pitch limiting voice treatment for patients with PD. The feasibility of EST for independent speech training in the home environment was verified through a questionnaire. The questionnaire addressed the participant's individual experiences with EST as well as the extent of satisfaction with technological features of EST, the content of the speech training, and the suitability of the home training environment. The potential efficacy of EST as a device to improve speech intelligibility was investigated using a repeated measures with randomized blocks design. The proportion of correct orthographic transcriptions of semantically unpredictable sentences as well as ratings of perceived intelligibility on a 10-point scale were used as measures for speech intelligibility. Results: Outcomes of the questionnaire resulted in recommendations to enhance EST feasibility. Speech intelligibility, as measured by transcription scores, improved significantly after EST training. This improvement was maintained for 2 weeks after completing the EST training, whereas considerably lower scores were observed after 11 weeks without training. Subjective ratings of intelligibility did not show significant differences across time. Conclusions: The results of this case study confirm the potential of EST for patients with PD.

AB  - While iPads and other mobile devices are gaining popularity in educational settings, challenges associated with teachers’ use of technology continue to hold true. Preparing preservice teachers within teacher preparation programs to gain experience learning and teaching science using mobile technologies is critical for them to develop positive beliefs and self-efficacy for future technology integration. The purpose of this study was to investigate changes in preservice elementary teachers’ technology self-efficacy during their participation in a specialized science content course that utilized a mobile technology-based physics curriculum, Exploring Physics. The Exploring Physics curriculum is available as a hybrid online-offline application running on multiple platforms (iOS, Android, PC/Mac). Participants included 34 preservice elementary teachers who participated in pre- and post-implementation of a technology self-efficacy survey. Data sources also included two focus-group and individual interviews with six participants, weekly classroom observations, and artifacts. Results showed significant positive changes in participants’ technology self-efficacy regarding the use of mobile technologies in science teaching. Factors that supported participants’ technology self-efficacy included: (a) firsthand experiences with iPads, (b) enhanced science content understandings, (c) high interactivity and engagement, and (c) instructor modeling the use of technology. Findings have implications for preservice teacher preparation for technology integration in science teaching. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This chapter explains how data-mining-based techniques can be used to discover interesting knowledge from sequences of life events, that is, to find out how people sequence important life events. We illustrate with data from the biographical survey conducted by the Swiss Household Panel in 2002. The focus is on the sequencing of events in the occupational life course and of events, such as starting a union and childbirth, that affect living arrangements. Addressed methods include finding of frequent sequential patterns, identification of discriminant subsequences, and clustering of event sequences. Mining of sequentially organized data has been successfully exploited in many domains such as genetics, device control, and speech recognition as well as for automatic text, customer behavior, and web logs analysis. In the social sciences sequence exploration mainly focuses on state sequences, and consists typically of building typologies by means of the optimal matching approach. In contrast, we focus in this chapter on event sequences rather than state sequences. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Handsets are being transformed from the traditional cellular phone to an integrated content delivery platform for communications. Their increasing capabilities and value-added features provide more utilities, and at the same time, make the design more complicated and the devices more difficult to use. The objective of this study was to explore and identify the critical factors that predicate the handset’s perceived usability. An online survey was conducted by using a seven-point Likert-scale structured questionnaire tailored to measure the user’s perception of the usability level of their current handset. A total of nine usability dimensions were derived from the results of exploratory factor analysis. The total variance explained by these nine factors was 65.20% of the overall variance of the data. Relationships between the nine usability factors and handset design features were described by regression models. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Reports an error in 'Exploring digital creativity in the workspace: The role of enterprise mobile applications on perceived job performance and creativity' by Sunghun Chung, Kyung Young Lee and Jinho Choi (Computers in Human Behavior, 2015[Jan], Vol 42, 93-109). In the original article, the affiliation was incorrectly listed in for Sunghun Chung. The correction affiliation is present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2014-13933-001[/rid]). This study examines enterprise mobile applications (EMA) to explain how creative job performance is revealed from both the habitual use and task-technology fit for EMA, while also considering the moderating effect of organizational agility. Based on a large-scale survey from employees who use EMA in their workplace across industries, our results suggest that the impact of EMA on perceived job performance and creativity as creativity-supporting systems (in terms of both the habitual use and task-technology fit for EMA) is positive and significant. Our results indicate the positive moderating effect of organizational agility on the relationship between task-technology fit for EMA and perceived job performance. We also identify task-(mobility and feedback) and technology-(reliability, accessibility, and overall quality) characteristics that are found to be positively associated with task-technology fit for EMA. Further, we find that external factors, such as perceived critical mass and the reputation of EMA, can more efficiently explain the habitual use of EMA than internal factors, such as trust and self-efficacy for EMA. The present findings enable researchers and practitioners to understand the role of EMA, which facilitates organizational workers’ creative work processes, as well as it inspires the exploration of digital creativity in the workplace.

AB  - Despite the growing importance of the online mobile gaming industry, little research has been undertaken to explain why consumers engage in this ubiquitous entertainment. This study attempts to develop an instrument to measure experiential value in online mobile gaming adoption. The proposed scale consists of seven first-order factors of experiential value: intrinsic enjoyment, escapism, efficiency, economic value, visual appeal, perceived novelty, and perceived risklessness. The survey obtained 164 usable responses from Japanese college students. The empirical data fit our first-order model well, indicating a high level of reliability as well as convergent and discriminant validity. The single second-order model also shows an acceptable model fit. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Support groups provide opportunities for participants to express and get in touch with their feelings and emotions. For children such groups provide a non-threatening environment in which they can share their feelings and concerns openly with one another. The wide range of social networking options made easily accessible via mobile technologies has seen children increasingly connecting with their peers in search of emotional support. For parents and professionals alike the question arises as to whether these online groups provide the positive support environment necessary to ensure children feel comfortable sharing their emotional concerns. In this study qualitative content analysis of the communications shared between the young members of an online support group for siblings of children with special needs revealed that participants felt confident to openly express a range of strong feelings and emotions, including hate, love, confusion, hurt, fear, jealousy and embarrassment.

AB  - Introduction: Electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) are becoming increasingly popular but little is known about how e-cig users’ transition between the different device types and what device characteristics and preferences may influence the transition. Methods: Four thousand four hundred twenty-one experienced e-cig users completed an online survey about their e-cig use, devices, and preferences. Participants included in analysis were ever cigarette smokers who used an e-cig at least 30 days in their lifetime and who reported the type of their first and current e-cig device and the nicotine concentration of their liquid. Analyses focused on transitions between 'first generation' devices (same size as a cigarette with no button) and 'advanced generation' devices (larger than a cigarette with a manual button) and differences between current users of each device type. Results: Most e-cig users (n = 2603, 58.9%) began use with a first generation device, and of these users, 63.7% subsequently transitioned to current use of an advanced generation device. Among users who began use with an advanced generation device (n = 1818, 41.1%), only 5.7% transitioned to a first generation device. Seventy-seven percent of current advanced generation e-cig users switched to their current device in order to obtain a 'more satisfying hit.' Battery capabilities and liquid flavor choices also influenced device choice. Conclusion: E-cig users commonly begin use with a device shaped like a cigarette and transition to a larger device with a more powerful battery, a button for manual activation and a wider choice of liquid flavors.

AB  - The aim was to better understand structural factors associated with uptake of automated tailored interventions for smoking cessation. In a prospective randomized controlled trial with interventions only offered, not mandated, participants were randomized based on the following: web-based expert system (QuitCoach); text-messaging program (onQ); both as an integrated package; the choice of using either or both; or a control condition informed of a static website (not considered here). Participants were 3530 smokers or recent quitters recruited from two sources; those seeking smoking cessation information, mostly recruited over the phone, and a cold-contacted group recruited from an Internet panel. More participants (60.1%) initially accepted the intervention they had been offered than used it (42.5%). Uptake of each intervention differed substantially by both recruitment source and modality (phone or web). onQ was a little more popular overall, especially in the information seeker sample. Highest overall intervention uptake occurred in the choice condition. A web-based intervention is most attractive if the offer to use is made by web, whereas a phone-based intervention is more likely to be used if the offer is made over the phone. Providing automated interventions on multiple platforms allows for maximal choice and greatest overall use of some form of help. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - We examined the relationships between the determinants that affect customers’ use of food delivery apps. Using an extended technology acceptance model, we explored consumers’ experiences in purchasing delivery food through mobile apps. We distributed a self-administered questionnaire online and used structural equation modeling to test the hypotheses. We found that user-generated information, firm-generated information, and system quality had a significant effect on perceived usefulness. In addition, system quality and design quality strongly influenced the perceived ease of use, which improved perceived usefulness, and in turn, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use affected attitude toward the use of mobile apps. Practical implications for the food service industry are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study investigated whether any of seven factors of family dysfunction predicted five risk factors for developing eating disorders in young adult women. Participants completed demographic questions, the McMaster Family Assessment Device (Epstein, Baldwin, & Bishop, 1983) and the Setting Conditions for Anorexia Nervosa Scale (Slade & Dewey, 1986) online. Five stepwise multiple regressions evaluated whether FAD scores predicted any of the eating disorder risk factors. Unhealthy affective responsiveness predicted general dissatisfaction and social and personal anxiety, and unhealthy general functioning predicted adolescent problems. No FAD factors predicted perfectionism or weight control. These results confirm the importance of families' affective responsiveness and general functioning to the risk of developing eating disorders. However, the lack of relationship among problem-solving, communication, roles, affective involvement, or behavior control with any of the risk factors for eating disorders warrants further investigation.

AB  - Background: A nationwide survey of family members of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities ranging in age from birth through adulthood was conducted to replicate a similar effort by Wehmeyer and update the knowledge base concerning technology use by people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Method: Survey responses provided information about use of technology for mobility, hearing and vision, communication, independent living, and in the area of computer use. In addition, survey items queried the use of electronic and information technology devices such as use of email, mobile telephones and digital cameras. Results: Survey results showed that although the use of computers for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities is more prevalent, other technology use frequency is much the same as in the late 1990s. However, technology needs did vary among school-age individuals over time. Conclusion: Implications of results for technology use of people with disabilities are discussed through the lens of frequency of use and needs for individuals with disabilities.

AB  - This study was done in preparation for the launch of the National Children’s Study (NCS) main study. The goal of this study was to examine the feasibility (completion rates and completeness of data), acceptability, staff time and cost-effectiveness of three methods of data collection for the postnatal 3- and 9-month questionnaires completed as part of NCS protocol. Eligible NCS participants who were scheduled to complete a postnatal questionnaire at three and nine months were randomly assigned to receive either: (a) telephone data collection (b) web-based data collection, or (c) self-administered (mailed) questionnaires. Event completion rates and satisfaction across the three data collection methods were compared and the influence of socio-demographic factors on completion rates and satisfaction rates was examined. Cost data were compared to data for completion and satisfaction for each of the delivery methods. Completion rates and satisfaction did not differ significantly by method, but completeness of data did, with odds of data completeness higher among web than phone (p < 0.001) or mail (p < 0.001). Costs were highest for the phone, followed by mail and web methods (p < 0.001). No significant differences in participant time (i.e. burden) across the three data collection methods were seen. Mail and phone data collection were the least complete of the three methods and were the most expensive. Mailed data collection was neither complete nor exceptionally economical. Web-based data collection was the least costly and provided the most complete data. Participants without web access could complete the questionnaire over the phone.

AB  - We aim to investigate the impact of marketing science articles and tools on the practice of marketing. This impact may be direct (e.g., an academic article may be adapted to solve a practical problem) or indirect (e.g., its contents may be incorporated into practitioners' tools,which then influence marketing decision making). We use the term 'marketing science value chain' to describe these diffusion steps, and survey marketing managers, marketing science intermediaries (practicing marketing analysts), and marketing academics to calibrate the value chain. In our sample, we find that (1) the impact of marketing science is perceived to be largest on decisions such as the management of brands, pricing, new products, product portfolios, and customer/market selection, and (2) tools such as segmentation, survey-based choice models, marketing mix models, and pre-test market models have the largest impact on marketing decisions. Exemplary papers from 1982 to 2003 that achieved dual—academic and practice—impact are Guadagni and Little (1983) and Green and Srinivasan (1990). Overall, our results are encouraging. First, we find that the impact of marketing science has been largest on marketing decision areas that are important to practice. Second, we find moderate alignment between academic impact and practice impact. Third, we identify antecedents of practice impact among dual impact marketing science papers. Fourth, we discover more recent trends and initiatives in the period 2004–2012, such as the increased importance of big data and the rise of digital and mobile communication, using the marketing science value chain as an organizing framework.

AB  - This chapter provides a number of different strategies that faculty might use to leverage mobile devices within their courses. It explores the question of why we might consider taking a 'mobile-first' mentality when designing courses. A strategy that can be rather easily incorporated into the face-to-face classroom is the use the mobile devices as a way of delivering an advanced organizer. Many faculty utilize their campus learning management system (LMS) for face-to-face or online courses and most LMS have a mobile version. Arguably, one of the most important elements of any course is effective and efficient interaction between the instructor and student both in and out of the classroom. Another consideration of mobile-first design in the classroom is using alternative communication platforms to interact and communicate electronically with students. A fully mobile course would likely contain materials that are inherently interactive and adaptive to individual learners and where classroom activities can be easily completed on one's smartphone.

AB  - There is some evidence that a scrolling design may reduce breakoffs in mobile web surveys compared to a paging design, but there is little empirical evidence to guide the choice of the optimal number of items per page. We investigate the effect of the number of items presented on a page on data quality in two types of questionnaires: with or without user-controlled skips. Three versions of a 30-item instrument were compared, with 5, 15, or all 30 questions presented on a page, in two different surveys, one with skips and one without. We found that displaying 30 items on a page reduced the breakoff rate by almost one-third compared to presenting five items per page in the questionnaire without skips, but the difference was not statistically significant. In both surveys with and without skips, the completion times were significantly lower in the 30-item per page condition; however, item nonresponse rates were also higher. We give some practical recommendations to guide choices while designing questionnaires for mobile web surveys. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore the effects of different acupuncture insertion velocities. Design: This study was performed as a within-subject design to control for individual differences. The biomechanical properties of needle insertion and accompanying subjective acupuncture perception was compared between different insertion velocities. Setting: The setting for this study was the laboratory of acupuncture meridian and functional neurology, Acupuncture and Meridian Science Research Center, Kyung Hee University. Subjects: Sixteen (16) healthy volunteers participated in the study. Intervention: An acupuncture needle was inserted to the acupoint LI4 by an acupuncture needle insertion device (ANI-KY) at high or low speed of needle insertion. Outcome measures: Biomechanical properties such as force and depth were measured online by sensors equipped with the ANI-KY device. Participants filled out a questionnaire about acupuncture sensation or perception. Results: Acupuncture needle insertion at a higher velocity was linked with higher maximum power, lower level of pain, and de qi–like perceptions such as 'compressing' and 'heavy' ( p < 0.05). Conclusions: These results suggest that needle insertion velocity might be a factor for controlling inadvertent pain during the acupuncture needling process and that biomechanical properties of needling may be related to acupuncture perception or sensation.

AB  - This study unveils the cognitive mechanism that locus of control (LOC) dimensions (internal control, chance control, and control by powerful others) predict intention to reuse mobile apps for making hotel reservations. The predictions are assumed through the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) anchors and perceived risk. Drawn from an online survey with 457 Chinese participants, results show direct positive predictions of intention to reuse from UTAUT anchors including performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions. Perceived risk also negatively predicts intention. Effort expectancy mediates the links between internal/chance control and intention, whereas perceived risk mediates only the latter link. Facilitating conditions mediate the relationship between control by powerful others and intention. This study contributes to existing research by distinguishing the mechanisms that underpin LOC dimensions and technology re-adoption. Practitioners are recommended to improve booking apps by addressing the concerns of users with different LOC. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Using a comprehensive personality model, this study is the first to examine the relationship between a full range of personality traits and cell phone addiction. 346 college students completed an online survey that asked respondents to complete measures of the Big-Five personality traits and measures of materialism and need for arousal, Barratt’s (1959) impulsiveness scale, and a four-item measure of cell phone addiction. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Couched in Mowen’s (2000) 3M Hierarchical Model of Personality, the elemental traits of emotional instability and materialism were positively associated while introversion was negatively associated with cell phone addiction. The central trait of attention impulsiveness exhibited a direct and positive association with cell phone addiction. A significant negative relationship between conscientiousness and all three dimensions of Barratt’s impulsiveness scale (central trait) was found. Several additional relationships between the elemental traits of Mowen’s personality hierarchy and the three dimensions of impulsiveness (central trait) also were uncovered. Study implications and future research directions are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This exploratory research considers the implications to actual world (AW) nations and attachments of an online virtual world (OVW) which mimics so many aspects of AW nation-states. Using Lessing's interrogation of mimesis as a framing device, this paper presents the results of a quantitative investigation that examines the relationship between the competing loyalties of AW nations and the OVW of Second Life (SL). To that end, a subsample of 212 members of SL completed an online survey which measured five aspects of the national and SL attachment, including a section in which participants ranked their concern for fellow co-nationals (CNs) versus their concern for fellow Second Lifers (SLers). Analyses of the data produced four main findings. First, 45 per cent of participants ranked their concern for their fellow SLers above that of their fellow CNs. Second, those who preferred SLers were significantly less attached to their AW nations than those who preferred CNs. Third, the SLer-preferred, on average, considered SL to be like a world, while the CN-preferred were more ambivalent in this regard. Fourth, gender differences indicate that males who preferred SLers spent most of their time in the SL engaged in activities while females who preferred SLers spent most of their time in the SL engaged in communicatory socializing. Discussion of these results focuses on notions of cosmopolitanism versus nation-statehood and uses the category of gender to illustrate the implications of mimesis to the durability of the phenomenon of nation-statehood.

AB  - A recent hypothesis in empirical brain research on language is that the fundamental difference between animal and human communication systems is captured by the distinction between finite‐state and more complex phrase‐structure grammars, such as context‐free and context‐sensitive grammars. However, the relevance of this distinction for the study of language as a neurobiological system has been questioned and it has been suggested that a more relevant and partly analogous distinction is that between non‐adjacent and adjacent dependencies. Online memory resources are central to the processing of non‐adjacent dependencies as information has to be maintained across intervening material. One proposal is that an external memory device in the form of a limited push‐down stack is used to process non‐adjacent dependencies. We tested this hypothesis in an artificial grammar learning paradigm where subjects acquired non‐adjacent dependencies implicitly. Generally, we found no qualitative differences between the acquisition of non‐adjacent dependencies and adjacent dependencies. This suggests that although the acquisition of non‐adjacent dependencies requires more exposure to the acquisition material, it utilizes the same mechanisms used for acquiring adjacent dependencies. We challenge the push‐down stack model further by testing its processing predictions for nested and crossed multiple non‐adjacent dependencies. The push‐down stack model is partly supported by the results, and we suggest that stack‐like properties are some among many natural properties characterizing the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms that implement the online memory resources used in language and structured sequence processing.

AB  - Chinese classrooms, whether on school grounds or online, have long suffered from a lack of interactivity. Many online classes simply provide recorded lectures to which students listen after downloading. This format only reinforces the negative effects of passive non-participatory learning. At the e-Learning Lab of Shanghai Jiaotong University researchers and developers actively seek technologic interventions that can greatly increase interactivity in blended classes. They developed a cutting-edge mobile learning system that can deliver live broadcast of real-time classroom teaching to online students with mobile devices. Their system allows students to customise means of content-reception, based on when and where the students are tuning in to the broadcast. The system also supports short text messaging and instant polls. Through these venues, students can ask questions and make suggestions in real time, and the instructor can address them immediately. Here we describe this system in detail, and also report results from a test implementation of the system with a blended classroom of 1000 students (250 campus and 750 online).

AB  - Ratings of severity and frequency of engagement with distracting driver behaviours are reported in this paper. Survey data were collected using an anonymous online questionnaire. Four hundred eighty-two respondents contributed to the survey during a 2 month data collection period. Results indicate that the three behaviours rated as most distracting when driving were (i) writing text messages (41%), (ii) reading text messages (62%), and (iii) using a cellular telephone hand-held (52%). The three most frequently reported distracting behaviours that resulted in accidents were (i) ‘interaction with child passengers’ 2.1% (near misses = 7.5%), (ii) both, route guidance destination entry with 2% (near misses = 2.8%) and use of an ‘… add-on media device, e.g., an iPod’ with 2% (near misses = 3.9%), and (iii) the three items ‘reading a text message’, ‘following advice from a route guidance system’, and ‘interaction with pets’, all with 1.7% of respondents reporting an accident when undertaking the activity (with 6.5%, 3%, and 2.2% respectively for near misses). Two hierarchical regression models were explored. The first introducing personal factors, i.e., age, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability and intellect (R² = 0.131, p < 0.001). The second controlled for variables in the first model and introduced driver-related variables, mileage, penalty points, and frequency of accidents with assumed responsibility (R² = 0.253, p < 0.001). This model identified age, extraversion, mileage, penalty points and accidents all to be significant predictors of engagement with unnecessary distractions. The data presents a picture of widespread awareness of, and engagement with, distracting behaviours by drivers in the United Kingdom. Findings from the hierarchical regressions suggest scope may exist to mediate the levels of distracting behaviours by exploring individual differences and driving styles.

AB  - Introduction: International mobility of researchers has always been a characteristic of academia. However, it became more intense in recent years. While long stays abroad are strongly promoted, their personal impact has only been rarely assessed. Objective: The aim of this study is to establish to what extent a long stay abroad influences work engagement, well-being feeling, affective organizational commitment and attitude towards future international mobility. Method: Participants included 188 researchers who responded to an online survey. Results: Results indicate that work engagement and well-being increase when the international mobility is perceived as successful. Analyzes also show that mobility perceived as voluntary and successful positively predicts favorable attitude towards future international mobility. In addition to these results, descriptive statistics report that men are more inclined to be mobile than women. Conclusion: The positive effects of the international mobility are discussed as well as its perverse effects. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - There has been increasing interest in informal learning in recent years alongside interest in how such learning can be supported by technology. However, relatively little is known about the extent to which adults make use of their own mobile devices to support informal learning. In this study, a survey was used to investigate whether, and to what extent, experienced users of mobile devices use their mobile devices to support intentional informal learning. If so, do they make use of mobile device connectivity to support opportunistic informal learning and does such connectivity support or encourage collaborative informal learning? Experienced mobile device users were recruited from web forums and business, and asked whether they used their devices to support informal learning. A pattern of learning uses emerged, some of which deployed the mobile device capabilities relatively unchanged, others triggered adaptations to typical learning activities to provide a better fit to the needs of the learner. These informal learning activities provided the basis for the design of a flexible mobile learning framework that can be extended to support developments in mobile technology, and increasing use of Web 2.0 technologies by informal learners.

AB  - This paper introduces a new perspective on information behavior in Web 2.0 environments, including the role of mobile access in bridging formal to informal learning. Kuhlthau’s (1991, 2007) Information Search Process (ISP) model is identified as a theoretical basis for exploring Information Seeking attitudes and behaviors, while social learning and literacy concepts of Vygotsky (1962, 1978), Bruner (1962, 1964) and Jenkins (2010) are identified as foundations for Information Sharing. The Guided Inquiry Spaces model (Maniotes, 2005) is proposed as an approach to bridging the student’s informal learning world and the curriculum-based teacher’s world. Research within this framework is operationalized through a recently validated Information and Communications Technology Learning (ICTL) survey instrument measuring learners’ preferences for self-expression, sharing, and knowledge acquisition interactions in technology-pervasive environments. Stepwise refinement of ICTL produced two reliable and valid psychometric scales, Information Sharing (alpha = .77) and Information Seeking (alpha = .72). Cross-validation with an established Mobile Learning Scale (Khaddage & Knezek, 2013) indicates that Information Sharing aligns significantly (p < .05) with Mobile Learning. Information Seeking, Information Sharing, and mobile access are presented as important, complimentary components important, complimentary components in the shift along the formal to informal learning continuum. Therefore, measures of these constructs can assist in understanding students’ preferences for 21st century learning. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study takes place from the idea that the personal usage of mobile technologies can bring positive outcomes to the user and to their society in an indirect way. Technologies studied in this work are defined as persuasive technologies (Fogg, 1997) because they are intentionally designed to modify the users’ attitude or behavior. This research is aimed to evaluate if the intention to use the application can be influenced by positive attitudes toward technology, by the persuasive power of the application and by the perceived fun. Participants (N = 118; M = 55; F = 63; mean age = 27.4; range age = 15–69) filled in an online questionnaire that was partly based on the Media and Technology Usage and Attitude Scale (MTUAS—Rosen et al., 2013). An additional eight items were added to the scale, aimed at evaluating participants’ technophobia, technophilia, perceived technology pervasiveness and perceived persuasive power of technology. By using linear regression analysis, it was found that the application’s informational power and the perceived entertainment positively influenced the usage intention. Another interesting result, obtained through ANOVA, concerns a generational difference: baby boomers tended to trust more the fact that the single individual action through the application can have an effective impact on the environment. These results represent a basis for future in-depth investigations about socially relevant use of the ICT. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Rapid advances in tablet technology and the increasing availability of electronic survey applications provide opportunities to streamline on-site human dimensions data collection. This article compares response rates and cost efficiencies of an iPad interface used for on-site survey administration to other types of human dimensions of wildlife survey administration response rates and expenses. Results also illustrate respondents' interface preference from a recent survey administered at National Wildlife Refuges and National Parks across the United States. Refuge and Park visitors enjoyed taking on-site surveys on iPads more than traditional paper surveys, and indicated a preference for taking future surveys on iPads instead of paper (t = 21.64, p < .001, η = .39); iPad survey administration was more cost efficient for large (over 1,350) survey samples, and garnered a higher than average response rate than online and mail surveys, but similar to average response rates for on-site intercept survey administration.

AB  - Background: What, when, how, how much, and how often infants are fed have been associated with childhood obesity risk. The objective of this secondary analysis was to examine the effect of a responsive parenting (RP) intervention designed for obesity prevention on parents’ infant feeding practices in the first year after birth. Methods: Primiparous mother-newborn dyads were randomized to the Intervention Nurses Start Infants Growing on Healthy Trajectories (INSIGHT) Study RP intervention or child safety control. Research nurses delivered intervention content at home at infant age 3–4, 16, 28, and 40 weeks, and at a research center at 1 year. RP feeding guidance advised feeding that was contingent (i.e., feed in response to hunger and satiety signs, alternatives to using food to soothe), and developmentally appropriate (i.e., delaying introduction of solids, age-appropriate portion sizes). Infant feeding practices (i.e., bottle use, introduction of solids, food to soothe) were assessed by phone interviews and online surveys and dietary intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire. Results: RP mothers were more likely to use of structure-based feeding practices including limit-setting (p < 0.05) and consistent feeding routines (p < 0.01) at age 1 year. RP group mothers were less likely to use non-responsive feeding practices such as pressuring their infant to finish the bottle/food (p < 0.001), and using food to soothe (p < 0.01), propping the bottle (p < 0.05) assessed between 4 and 8 months, and putting baby to bed with a bottle at age 1 year (p < 0.05). Few differences were seen between groups in what specific foods or food groups infants were fed. Conclusions: Anticipatory guidance on RP in feeding can prevent the use of food to soothe and promote use of more sensitive, structure-based feeding which could reduce obesity risk by affecting how and when infants are fed during the first year.

AB  - Aims: This study comprised part of a larger cross-sectional survey performed in Hungary in the period 2005–2006, which was designed first to reveal the representative age-, gender- and height-specific percentile values for the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in Hungarian children aged 11–16 years. The second aim was to determine the prevalence of overweight and obesity. Methods: Analyses were performed on 14 290 Hungarian children aged 11–16 years. All blood pressure (BP) measurements were made with a validated, automated, digital device. The criteria recommended by international guidelines were used. Results: The prevalence of overweight and obesity among the Hungarian children was found to be 23.4% (3347 adolescents; International Obesity Task Force criteria). Previous studies have reported that the strongest correlation is observed between the BP values and weight, and our results are in accordance with this. Conclusions: Regional differences in morphometry (different prevalences of overweight and obesity) and the genetic background, disparate eating habits and other cultural factors may account for the differences in BP levels during childhood. As the prevalence of overweight and obesity is increasing worldwide, it is important that countries carefully monitor the weight and BP status of their children and adolescents.

AB  - Background: The Stand Up Victoria multi-component intervention successfully reduced workplace sitting time in both the short (three months) and long (12 months) term. To further understand how this intervention worked, we aimed to assess the impact of the intervention on four social-cognitive constructs, and examined whether these constructs mediated intervention effects on workplace sitting time at 3 and 12 months post-baseline. Methods: Two hundred and thirty one office-based workers (14 worksites, single government employer) were randomised to intervention or control conditions by worksite. The intervention comprised organisational, environmental, and individual level elements. Participant characteristics and social-cognitive constructs (perceived behavioural control, barrier self-efficacy, perceived organisational norms and knowledge) were measured through a self-administered online survey at baseline, 3 months and 12 months. Workplace sitting time (min/8 h day) was measured with the activPAL3 device. Single multi-level mediation models were performed for each construct at both time points. Results: There were significant intervention effects at 3 months on perceived behavioural control, barrier self-efficacy and perceived organisational norms. Effects on perceived organisational norms were not significant at 12 months. Perceived behavioural control significantly mediated intervention effects at 3 months, accounting for a small portion of the total effect (indirect effect: −8.6 min/8 h day, 95% CI: −18.5, −3.6 min; 7.5% of total effect). At 12 months, barrier self-efficacy significantly mediated the intervention effects on workplace sitting time (indirect effect: −10.3 min/8 h day, 95% CI: −27.3, −2.2; 13.9% of total effect). No significant effects were observed for knowledge at either time point. Conclusions: Strategies that aim to increase workers’ perceived control and self-efficacy over their sitting time may be helpful components of sedentary behaviour interventions in the workplace. However, social-cognitive factors only partially explain variation in workplace sitting reduction. Understanding the importance of other levels of influence (particularly interpersonal and environmental) for initiating and maintaining workplace sedentary behaviour change will be informative for intervention development and refinement.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine the factors that influence social presence and user satisfaction with Mobile Instant Messaging (mIM). The proposed research model integrates channel expansion, social influence, social presence and media richness theories, to explain how user experience, social influence, and medium richness influence social presence and user satisfaction with mIM. A total of 239 students from a state university in the US participated in this study. Data was collected via a web-based survey. The results suggest that user experience, social influence, and perceived richness are important drivers for social presence and user satisfaction in mIM. The implications of the study findings are discussed in the paper. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Children are growing up in a digital age with increasing exposure to television and touchscreen devices. We tested whether exposure to screen media is associated with children’s early language development. One hundred and thirty-one highly educated caregivers of UK children aged 6–36 months completed a media exposure questionnaire and vocabulary measure. 99% of children were read to daily, 82% watched television, and 49% used mobile touchscreen devices daily. Regression analyses revealed that time spent reading positively predicted vocabulary comprehension and production scores at 6–18 months, but time spent engaging with television or mobile touchscreen devices was not associated with vocabulary scores. Critically, correlations revealed that time spent reading or engaging with other non-screen activities was not offset by time spent engaging with television or mobile touchscreen devices. Thus, there was no evidence to suggest that screen media exposure adversely influenced vocabulary size in our sample of highly educated families with moderate media use.

AB  - The viewing of television programming on screens other than a television set has become increasingly common. This article discusses the different modes of viewing that have emerged as a result of timeshifting, downloading, streaming and mobile technologies. Using data collected from an online survey (n = 671) over a six-month period in 2010–2011, we present a descriptive and inferential statistical analysis of both traditional and emerging modes of viewing. We also examine whether significant differences exist across three demographic variables: gender, age and country or region of residence. Our findings show that while the majority of viewing still takes place in front of a television screen, the computer has achieved secondary screen status among North Americans and equal status among younger viewers and Europeans. Viewing on a mobile device remains minimal across all demographics. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The purpose of the study described in this chapter was to survey Gen Y job seekers in order to gain a clearer understanding of the expectations of the recruitment process. Specifically, this study focused on the pre employment phase that is likely to begin during on-campus interviews, at a career fair, or over the phone. The aim of this study was to inform organizations that seek to attract Gen Y workers about what is important during the pre employment phase. Based on this notion, the following four conclusions were drawn as evidenced by the empirical and qualitative results and implications discussed previously. In order to maintain high procedural justice perceptions, organizations must treat candidates fairly by informing them about how information is gathered during the pre employment phase. As an example, many of the Gen Y candidates desire to know more about how information is gathered: will the organization conduct a web search, will they conduct a search on Facebook, will they call personal and professional references, and the like.

AB  - Reports an error in 'Language learner perspectives on the functionality and use of electronic language dictionaries' by Mike Levy and Caroline Steel (ReCALL: Journal of Eurocall, Advanced Online Publication, Jan 5, 2015, np). The authors would like to amend two incorrect attributions. The first attribution to be corrected is in the first sentence after the heading ‘2 Language dictionaries: Perspectives on use and design’. The second attribution to be corrected is in the second sentence of the sixth paragraph following the heading ‘2.2 Functionality’, which reads 'In a large-scale survey on dictionary use, Granger (2012b: 445, 448) found that...' The corrections to these attributions, as well as a correction to the end reference, are provided in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2015-15050-001[/rid].) Abstract This paper investigates the extent of electronic dictionary use by language learners in an Australian university. All students in the study are formally enrolled in language courses across ten languages at first, second or third year level. The study places a particular emphasis on gauging student perceptions of the beneficial aspects of electronic dictionaries as judged by learners themselves in circumstances where they are able to act independently. As these benefits are often described in terms of usability and functionality, these particular terms are defined and introduced in the literature review, and then later they are employed to help structure and describe the results. The arguments for the discussion are supported by the use of empirical data taken from a large-scale survey conducted in 2011 (n=587) where comments from students were obtained on why and how dictionary-type resources were accessed and used (see also Steel & Levy, 2013). The paper restricts itself to the quantitative and qualitative data gathered on mobile phones, translators, dictionaries and web conjugators and related items (e.g. discussion forums). The particular functions that students use and the ways in which they use them are described and categorised, with the discussion supported by student comments. The data exhibits a remarkable range of resources available to students to look up unknown words or to see translations and, consequently, our understanding of what exactly an electronic dictionary might comprise is challenged. Many students’ comments demonstrate a sophistication and knowledge about the effective use of these dictionary tools together with a keen awareness of their limitations.

AB  - The CAL09 conference had as its central focus ‘learning in digital worlds’, both real and virtual. In that sense many of the papers in this special reflect key concepts of co-operation, interaction and dynamism—a sense of operating in learning spaces rather than one of being operated on. At CAL09 the topics under discussion largely focused on the student experience of this innovation; both as a tool for learning and for assessment. The changing roles of key educational stakeholders, pupils, parents and teachers are brought to the fore in the papers of this issue. The articles present research questions and methodologies in the variety of contexts from artificial intelligent design, to blended learning in HE, interactivity in school classrooms settings, and mobile learning in physical and virtual worlds.

AB  - Using Rogers’ diffusion of innovation model, this study examined the relationships between lifestyles and the adoption of six new technologies in Taiwan. Three of the six technologies—notebooks, netbooks, and tablet PCs—are information technologies, while the remaining three technologies—Wii, Kinect, and digital videos (DVs)—are entertainment technologies. A telephone survey was adopted to obtain a representative sample, which obtained 1157 valid calls with a response rate of 53.1%. Two conclusions are drawn from the data analysis. First, lifestyles did play a significant role in predicting the adoption of the six technologies. Second, this study found that demographics and mass media use were more predictive of the adoption of information technologies than that of the adoption of entertainment technologies.

AB  - This chapter describes case studies conducted in five European countries, where language learners were invited to use 'LingoBee,' a mobile app, as a means of supporting their language learning. Assuming that today’s language learners are mobile savvy and 'Digital Natives' and that they should be able to engage in language learning autonomously using technology, initial studies were conducted with little or no intervention by the language teachers. However, the support and guidance provided within a teacher-led context can impact positively on learner engagement. The case studies confirm this hypothesis. This chapter addresses the research question: Does the level of the support and guidance and pedagogical approach impact on learners’ engagement and the synergy between formal and informal learning? Based on the experiences from the five case studies, recommendations are provided for teachers and designers of educational technologies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This paper describes three case studies, where language learners were invited to use 'LingoBee' as a means of supporting their language learning. LingoBee is a mobile app that provides user-generated language content in a cloud-based shared repository. Assuming that today’s students are mobile savvy and 'Digital Natives' able to engage in language learning autonomously using technology, initial studies were conducted with little or no intervention by the language teachers. However, the support and guidance provided within a teacher-led context can impact positively on learner engagement and use of LingoBee. The authors discuss this hypothesis using three case studies conducted in three European countries, within the EU LLP project SIMOLA, Situated Mobile Language Learning. This paper answers the research question: Does the level of the support and guidance, pedagogical approach and prior learning impact on learners’ engagement and use of LingoBee? An earlier version of this paper was presented at the IADIS Mobile Learning 2013 conference. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In an earlier paper we described a structured, theory-driven training programme which was administered to 10 individuals with moderate-to-severe memory impairment. All individuals received an errorless-fading-of-cues protocol in the use of personal digital assistants (PDAs) or smartphones (Svoboda, Richards, Leach, & Mertens, 2012) and demonstrated generalisation of acquired skills to day-to-day memory challenges. Maintenance of intervention gains over the long-term is another indicator of successful generalisation. Here we present the maintenance of device use in the same group of individuals 12 to 19 months after programme completion. A within-subject, ABABB multi-case experimental design was used to evaluate the impact of PDA or smartphone use on day-to-day memory functioning at baseline, immediately post-intervention, at return to baseline, and at short-term and long-term follow-up. Results presented here focus predominantly on long-term follow-up. All 10 individuals showed maintenance of gains in day-to-day functioning as quantified across several ecologically valid questionnaire and task-based measures. This was corroborated by family members with whom six of the participants resided. This study further demonstrates the programme's clinical effectiveness in enabling individuals with moderate-to-severe memory impairment to function more independently and with greater confidence up to 19 months following programme completion.

AB  - Mobile learning technologies and wireless networks are being increasingly used in educational settings. Mobile learning (M-learning) through wireless technology can deliver information access to anyone any time in any place. A study was conducted to investigate the readiness of Mathematics students in Brunel University to move towards using Mobile Learning in their studies, and also to explore the factors that might affect the implementation of this technology. A total number of 82 students participated in an online questionnaire in May 2011. The questionnaire was designed in order to determine the availability of the appropriate devices, students’ perceptions about M-learning and their expectations of mobile learning services. The findings of the study show that students have a positive perspective of using M-learning and they look at it as a support system for traditional class-based learning.

AB  - Objectives: Previous research suggests that anticipation of incoming phone calls or messages and impulsivity are significantly associated with motor vehicle crash. We took a more explanative approach to investigate a conceptual model regarding the direct and indirect effect of compulsive cell phone use and impulsive personality traits on crash risk. Methods: We recruited a sample of 307 undergraduate college students to complete an online survey that included measures of cell phone use, impulsivity, and history of motor vehicle crash. Using a structural equation model, we examined the direct and indirect relationships between factors of the Cell Phone Overuse Scale-II (CPOS-II), impulsivity, in-vehicle phone use, and severity and frequency of previous motor vehicle crash. Self-reported miles driven per week and year in college were included as covariates in the model. Results: Our findings suggest that anticipation of incoming communication has a direct association with greater in-vehicle phone use, but was not directly or indirectly associated with increasing risk of previous motor vehicle crash. Of the three latent factors comprising the CPOS-II, only anticipation was significantly associated with elevated cell phone use while driving. Greater impulsivity and use of in-vehicle cell phone use while driving were directly and significantly associated with greater risk of motor vehicle crash. Conclusions: Anticipation of incoming cellular contacts (calls or texts) is associated with greater in-vehicle phone use, while greater in-vehicle cell phone use and impulsive traits are associated with elevated risk of motor vehicle crashes.

AB  - In today’s world of networked, mobile, and global digital communication, Muslim martyrdom as a multi-layered communicative practice has experienced a new type of media saturation, thereby posing a challenge for the study of media, religion, and culture in a digital age. In this article, the analysis focuses on two cases of high symbolic relevance for the events later referred to as the 'Arab Spring'—the deaths of a Tunisian fruit seller Mohammed Bouazizi and a young Egyptian man Khaled Saeed. Special focus is given to the discussion of digital solidarities and their construction in circulation and remediation of martyr narratives of Bouazizi and Saeed in diverse media contexts. In this global development of digital solidarities, we identify two categories of martyr images of particular relevance—a 'living martyr' and a 'tortured martyr'—and discuss their resonance with different historical, religious, cultural, and political frames of interpretation. In conclusion, we reflect on the question of the ethics of global mediation of Muslim martyrdom and its implications for the study field of media, religion, and culture in its digital state.

AB  - Today's technologies are thought to scatter our minds. Critics are warning against the onslaught of the digital on the material, especially when it comes to reading. Of course we must draw a distinction between the broad metaphoric idea of a bookshelf as embodying the contents of the mind, and the bookshelf as a purely practical, material tool for storing information, but nonetheless we should question what these new technologies are doing to our identities. The starting point should be the assumption that, despite the idea that the virtual world sees the denaturalization of experience, the digital world is not built on the ephemerality of the invisible, but on a profound groundedness in materiality, of human bodies providing material labor by stuffing broadband cables into the ground, or extracting metals from the ground to produce computers and mobile phones. One only needs to have a look at a few recent developments to understand the nature of this new materiality of the digital age. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In this paper, the authors suggest the merger of the Massively Open Online Course (MOOC) format and mobile learning (mLearning) based on mutual affordances of both contemporary learning/teaching formats to investigate learner interactions and dialogues in an open online course. The paper presents a case study of how MobiMOOC, a course created using the MOOC format, demonstrates the synergistic characteristics between the MOOC format and mLearning, making a combination of both fields ideal for contemporary, digital, collaborative learning, and knowledge construction based on learner interactions and dialogue. MobiMOOC was a six-week online course focusing on mLearning that ran in April and May 2011. An end-of-course survey provides insight that supports the synergies between MOOCs and mLearning: collaboration, informal and lifelong learning, and dialogue.

AB  - Media significantly shape how and what we learn. To date there is limited understanding of digital media and information use by engineering students. We comprehensively review existing literature and present findings from a research study investigating digital media and information use of ‘millennial’ engineers who purportedly possess distinctive experience, habits, and perceptions about technology. We administered a multiple-item survey to a cohort of first year engineering students who entered a large public university in the United States in August 2009. Self-reported information on the frequency of media device usage, participation in social networking, academic activities and information seeking tendencies, was received from 204 participants. Similar to other youth, millennial engineers use technology extensively and are frequent users of both commonly used digital devices as well as applications. Students’ device ownership was marked by a relatively low use of desktop computers and significant use of mobile devices. Students reported using the Internet extensively for both entertainment and school related work. Facebook™ use was common but Twitter™ use was limited. Multitasking was common and its self-reported effectiveness varied across participants. Gender differences were found across several items. Implications for teaching and learning are discussed.

AB  - The ‘Mind-Upload’ hypothesis (MU), a radical version of the Brain-in-a-Vat thought experiment, asserts that a whole mind can safely be transferred from a brain to a digital device, after being exactly encoded into substrate independent informational patterns. Prima facie, MU seems the philosophical archenemy of the Embodied Mind theory (EM), which understands embodiment as a necessary and constitutive condition for the existence of a mind and its functions. In truth, whether and why MU and EM are ultimately incompatible is unobvious. This paper, which aims to answer both questions, will not simply confirm that MU and EM actually are incompatible. It will also show the true reason of their incompatibility: while EM implies that a mind’s individual identity is contingent upon the details of its physical constituents, MU presupposes that minds can be relocated from one material vessel to another. A systematic comparison between these conflicting assumptions reveals that the real shortcoming of MU is not the one usually discussed by the philosophical literature: it has nothing to do with MU’s functionalist or computationalist prerequisites, and is only secondarily related to the artificial implementability of consciousness; the real problem is that MU presupposes that minds could still be individuated and numerically identified while being reduced to immaterial formal patterns. EM seems committed to refute this assumption, but does it have sufficient resources to succeed? (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Multilingual classrooms in developing countries are often challenged by a lack of digital resources and technology which supports their multilingual learning process. Code-switching is a phenomenon common to multilingual schools where learners are taught in a language which is not their first language. In these environments, code-switchers frequently alternate between their first and second languages, seeking alternative words to clarify their understanding of the topic being studied. This paper presents a study based in South Africa, where mathematics learners interacted with a mobile learning system named M-Thuto, supporting learners who code-switch while learning and providing them with digital resources. The system consisted of summarised notes, class exercises and a class quiz. Through semi-structured interviews and questionnaires, data were gathered and analysed from 90 learners to gain perspectives on their interaction processes. The study aimed to establish how mobile learning can be used to support multilingual learners in under-resourced schools. The results of the study reflect the need for mobile learning resources that support their learning considering their linguistic challenges. The results also reflect the important role that mobile phones can play as alternative digital learning resources. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Contemporary children live in the digital environment and develop very quickly the natural ability in using technologies. At an international level, scientific research confirms the widespread use of mobile devices in the family and the increasing children exposure to these. This study mainly focuses on the following aspects: the benefits of touch devices for games and creativity and the risks related to possible delays in social and linguistic development and to addictions. In Italy, statistical surveys reveal a contradictory scenario: on the one hand, the digitization of citizens complies with international trends, especially regarding the use of the smartphone; on the other hand, there is a strong technological backwardness in the institutional area. The survey has analyzed the relationship between digitods and touch media, paying attention to usage profiles, usage behaviors, interaction, app selection and fruition processes. It has also been observed the parent-child interaction during the use of touch media, in order to figure out media educational guidelines in kindergarten.

AB  - This study explores how mobile instant messaging use, affordances, and social capital may directly and indirectly influence positive employee outcomes. A field survey of 245 Hong Kong real estate agents showed that their mobile instant messaging (MIM) use and affordances were positively associated with job performance, job satisfaction, and relational satisfaction, and with online bridging and bonding social capital. While bridging capital was not associated with any of the three outcomes, bonding social capital was positively related to the two satisfaction measures. However (with one small exception), neither type of social capital mediated relationships between MIM use and affordances, and employee outcomes.

AB  - In an era of digitally connected students, there is a demand for academic material to be delivered through electronic mobile devices and not just through traditional methods such as lectures and tutorials. A digital interactive book—iBook (for use on the Apple iPad)—was created to teach undergraduate anatomical science students (n = 26) four key areas of the brachial plexus: definitions, gross anatomy, relative anatomy, and functions of terminal branches. Students were asked to complete preresource and postresource questionnaires, which were used to calculate the mean improvement score and ultimately the efficacy of the resource. Free text comments were gathered to evaluate student opinions on this mode of learning. The mean score on the preresource and postresource questionnaires was 4.07 of 8 and 5.69 of 8, respectively. The overall mean improvement score was 1.62, determined statistically significant by a dependent t‐test (P = 0.0004). Findings demonstrate that digital books on the iPad provide a uniquely interactive way of delivering information and engaging students. Furthermore, digital books can be used alongside traditional methods of teaching anatomy to enhance and promote deep learning in students. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - There is little research examining the confluence of what communication channel is used for which purpose with which person. This study examines the 'setting' for communication that includes what is communicated (e.g. positive or negative messages), the nature of the relationship (close versus distant), and the information channel. The respondents to a web-based questionnaire (n = 627) were Norwegian smartphone users aged 16–35 years. Respondents evaluated mobile communication services that they used in specific social settings by 'checking off' all that apply. Two methods of analysis are used to examine the material. First, a Principal Component Regression validated the main method, namely a mixed model for the Analysis of Variance. Results show the probability of using a mobile communication service is based on the effects of social group, communication purpose, communication channel, and their interaction. The relationship to the interlocutor was found to have the strongest effect on channel choice. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The identification of the best learning style in an Intelligent Tutoring System must be considered essential as part of the success in the teaching process. In many implementations of automatic classifiers finding the right student learning style represents the hardest assignment. The reason is that most of the techniques work using expert groups or a set of questionnaires which define how the learning styles are assigned to students. This paper presents a novel approach for automatic learning styles classification using a Kohonen network. The approach is used by an author tool for building Intelligent Tutoring Systems running under a Web 2.0 collaborative learning platform. The tutoring systems together with the neural network can also be exported to mobile devices. We present different results to the approach working under the author tool.

AB  - Using technology to create new types of questions is important, but also exploring new types of test representations or analyzing the most adequate technological device to support a specific assessment activity based on tests. This paper presents a conceptual model that defines and relates three dimensions to be considered for advancing on Computing-Based Testing (CBT): the Question-item, the Test and the Activity. The framework assists in the categorization and design of advanced CBT scenarios and opens a new domain for questions and tests supported by ICT. Besides, the paper proposes two models for the technological design and implementation of the Test and Question-item dimensions. The models represent an extension of the IMS Question and Test Interoperability standard. They are platform-independent models (PIMs) that formulate the elements that can be mapped to platform-specific models (PSMs) for implementing advanced CBT solutions. To show the relevance, value and usability of the contributions, the paper also describes the application of the framework and PIMs to design and implement three exemplary CBT scenarios with their corresponding CBT-PSMs. Within the global scope of the CBT conceptual model, the first scenario shows how question-items can be enriched with specific multimedia information (web maps). The second scenario illustrates another particular case of the CBT domain where a test can be augmented with real physical elements. And finally, the third scenario describes an implementation that combines advanced question-items and tests using virtual worlds. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Microblogging and mobile devices appear to augment human social capabilities, which raises the question whether they remove cognitive or biological constraints on human communication. In this paper we analyze a dataset of Twitter conversations collected across six months involving 1.7 million individuals and test the theoretical cognitive limit on the number of stable social relationships known as Dunbar’s number. We find that the data are in agreement with Dunbar’s result; users can entertain a maximum of 100–200 stable relationships. Thus, the ‘economy of attention’ is limited in the online world by cognitive and biological constraints as predicted by Dunbar’s theory. We propose a simple model for users’ behavior that includes finite priority queuing and time resources that reproduces the observed social behavior.

AB  - The article addresses the role of network and mobile technologies in enhancing blended solutions with a view to (a) enriching the teaching/learning processes, (b) exploiting the opportunities it offers for their observability, and hence for their monitoring and formative/summative assessment. It will also discuss how such potential can only be captured by solidly integrating the process of instructional design with that of monitoring and assessment. First, the article presents the proposed conception of blended solutions, giving examples. In the second part, the article discusses a possible breakdown of blended solutions into its various components and how these can enrich both the teaching/learning and the assessment processes. Finally, it addresses the question of how to combine and/or use singly the various components of blended solutions. To conclude, implications for the implementation of blended solutions are discussed, also in relation to emerging contexts such as Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs).

AB  - My study extended TAM to include individuals’ intention to use mobile wireless technology (MWT). It added two new constructs, Perceived Cost Savings and Company’s Willingness to Fund, and two causal relationships, Job Relevance and Experience, as moderating effects. The 286 sets of data collected in an online survey were tested against the model using SEM. Results supported my new model: the new constructs and variables accounted for 62.7% of the variance found in an individual’s behavioral intention to use MWT. The path coefficients between the constructs ranged from 0.26 to 0.85 also supporting the model. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Comments on an article by S. Haar et al. (see record [rid]2015-24912-024[/rid]). Haar et al. addressed a question by examining whole-brain directional selectivity with multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) of fMRI data collected while human subjects performed a visuomotor adaption task. In contrast to traditional univariate analyses that average activity across relatively large brain regions, MVPA offers a refined framework that can reveal information represented by fine patterns of spatial activation. This allows researchers to decode cognitive representations from brain activity and to dissociate between neural mappings that would otherwise show the same overall level of activation. They implemented a slow event-related fMRI design in which participants made out-and-back hand movements to one of four visual targets. All movements were performed on a small MRI-compatible tablet that provided the participants online cursor feedback and recorded precise movement kinematics. Haar et al. have convincingly shown that mIPS, in addition to multiple brain regions along the motor hierarchy, can dissociate between reaches to different directions and that coding in mIPS is not specific to only the visual or motor components of the task.

AB  - In an ideal world, once you have decided you want an academic job—whether at a large research university, a small teaching university, or one of the many positions in between—you peruse the job ads posted online and find several positions that fit your research and teaching interests perfectly. You send out your application to the respective search committees. Within a few weeks, you receive either a phone call or an email from the chair of the search committee asking if you are still interested in the position. Assuming you are still interested, this person will help you make arrangements to come to the university for several days for an extended interview and formal talk. While at the interview (which lasts for two days and continues throughout all of your meals), you show interest in the department and university and highlight how your research and teaching fits well with their needs. You ask thought-provoking, yet uncontroversial questions. You give a dazzling and well organized job talk that convinces the audience that your work and teaching style are impressive. Although they must interview two more people for the position, and thus you must wait another few weeks to hear, they finally call you with a job offer which you gladly accept.

AB  - New opportunities have recently emerged in survey practice, coupled with a need to make changes, and alternative survey data collection modes such as those based on new technologies (for example, the Web and mobile phones) have become a focus of interest. Studies have considered the biases due to data collection modes and to the wording of questions in questionnaires, but they have rarely dealt with the interaction between the two phenomena. This paper presents the results of a study on the interactions between some of the best-known question-wording effects and three data collection modes: face-to-face, Web-based and SMS-based (Short Text Messaging). The results have highlighted some interesting characteristics of the various modes—innovative ones in particular—and have confirmed the existence of potential interactions between data collection modes and question-wording effects. The findings may have significant implications for the study and practice of surveys and entail that, when surveys are designed, account is taken of specific factors associated with the method used to word the questions in questionnaires.

AB  - This paper examines the experiences of undergraduate university students in response to the employment of video podcasts to support learning and teaching about exotic ecosystems. Six, 15–20-minute podcasts were made accessible to students through a virtual learning environment, either online or to download to mobile technology. The students were free to watch the podcasts whenever and wherever they chose to. The perceived and actual effectiveness of the technology was assessed by written questionnaire, focus groups and summative assessment results. Students agreed that the podcasts were effective in supporting learning and teaching on the course, largely by offering a flexible and visual learning experience. The podcasts were also perceived as a useful resource for revision and assessment, providing visual images that stimulated factual recall and highlighted knowledge gaps. There were no significant differences, however, in examination essay grades comparing cohorts prior to and post adoption of podcasts. The key to improving the student learning experience appears to lie not in adopting new pedagogy, but in reflexively developing the existing pedagogic strategies employed by both teachers and learners. Of primary importance is uniting the individual learning experience of podcasts with group exploration and critical discussion in a collaborative learning framework.

AB  - This study examined relations between a cross-cultural geographically mobile childhood and adulthood cultural homelessness, attachment to cross-cultural identities, and self esteem. Cross-cultural identities are loosely defined identities (e.g., third culture kids, military brats, missionary kids) that describe some individuals' childhood cross-cultural experience. The 475 participants spent at least two years before age 18 in a country different from their parents’ home culture, then returned to the latter. They completed an online survey which included general demographic information regarding cross-cultural experiences in childhood, as well as the Cultural Homelessness Criteria, the Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale, and items that evaluated the strength of affirmation, belonging, and commitment to a self-labeled cross-cultural identity. Cultural homelessness was related to lower self esteem scores; higher affirmation, belonging and commitment to any cross-cultural identity was related to higher self esteem and lower cultural homelessness. Furthermore, such affirmation, belonging, and commitment buffered the cultural homelessness–self esteem association, whereas just having a cross-cultural identity did not.

AB  - Aims and objectives: To report the informatics competencies of students in selected undergraduate and graduate nursing programmes, to examine whether informatics competencies differed between the different programmes and to suggest competency- based applications that will strengthen informatics courses and informatics-related content throughout the curricula. Background: Nursing students in undergraduate and graduate nursing programmes have different educational backgrounds and different practice experience. Thus, their informatics preparation is apt to be varied, and nursing curricula must reflect this variation while advancing students towards informatics proficiency. However, studies on informatics competency assessment in these nursing students are scarce. Design: A descriptive survey design. Methods: Data were collected from 289 nursing students using a 30-item Self-Assessment of Nursing Informatics Competencies Scale via an email sent to students using a LISTSERV mailing list. The email embedded link to the Internet survey package, SurveyMonkey, which included the Self-Assessment of Nursing Informatics Competencies Scale and demographic questions along with an online consent form. Results: Students in both programmes were competent in three subscale areas: basic computer knowledge and skills, clinical informatics attitude, and wireless device skills. Graduate students reported slightly higher mean competency scores than did undergraduate students in three subscales: clinical informatics role, clinical informatics attitude and wireless device skills. Conclusions: Findings indicate specific topics for nurse educators to consider when designing informatics curricula. The comparison of undergraduate and graduate students indicates similarities in informatics competencies in terms of areas where students were competent and small mean score differences. Further studies are suggested to examine whether there are differences in informatics competencies between undergraduate and graduate students. Relevance to clinical practice: These results assist nurse educators in determining specific areas of informatics content that need greater focus and inclusion in the design of better nursing educational programmes. Examples of integrating competencies into existing curriculum or informatics courses are suggested. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In contrast to the prominent individualistic view on self-disclosure, this study focuses on self-disclosure in groups of prior acquaintances that both meet offline and communicate online. It compares within-group self-disclosure between offline face-to-face (FtF) interactions and online communication via mobile messaging applications (MMAs). An online-survey (N = 357) was conducted to test for differences between within-group self-disclosure online and offline across four dimensions (amount, depth, breadth, valence). The results show that there is more amount, more breadth and more depth for offline within-group self-disclosure, but it is less positively valenced than online within-group self-disclosure. Interestingly, the mere frequency of communication is higher in an MMA environment. In spite of the permanent availability of the online communication sphere, group members do not permanently disclose personal information to each other online. Thus, for within-group self-disclosure, offline time seems quality time. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In this article I address some images, categories and open-ended trajectories of the laptop in music production. The aim is to explore the laptop's increasing presence in the sites of music, from cyberspace to live venues, as well as the relationship between music and mobile computerized space. Implicit in the article is the claim that the laptop is a neglected device, but that close attention to its position in cultural networks and everyday settings is one way of examining some possible ways into the complex entanglements and layerings of mobile space. The first part of the article explores the laptop as the archetypal nomadic machine of the digital age, inserted into mobile networks, hubs and flows. The laptop mediates mobility and by doing so not only serves macro-processes of social and economic change, but also opens up creative possibilities for the musician beyond the studio and the home. The second part of the article examines the role of software in activating the laptop's capabilities. The growth of music software and Virtual Studio Technology in the early 2000s, it will be argued, represents a major transformation in music production. A case study is made of a single application, Ableton Live, to show that new forms of music software encourage norms of creativity and play that take it beyond emulations of hardware studios. A residual distrust of the laptop's automative capabilities, however, reprises an anxiety in the history of popular music around questions of creativity and musicianship. The final part explores this anxiety and argues that the laptop is a place-holder for conflicting meanings about what belongs in music: productivity and creation, reality and virtuality, play and work, the cybernetic and the organic. It thereby reveals socio-technical imbroglios in action, where digitized music and software code meet the material properties of technologies and the practices of users in complex, networked societies.

AB  - This paper presents and discusses the initial findings of a mobile language learning project undertaken in the context of an undergraduate distance-learning French language programme at The Open University (UK). The overall objective of the project was to investigate students' experiences when using their own portable devices for additional listening and speaking practice within a course. Experience data were collected via weekly online questionnaires, recorded oral feedback and email. The use of iPods and MP3 players was quickly adopted by project participants; but whilst the challenge and the authentic aspect of doing activities on the phone appealed to some learners, we conclude that other learners will need to be helped towards recognizing the specific value of this type of practice as a stepping stone towards authentic communication. We suggest further areas of investigation and potential applications. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This chapter is, in many respects, an attempt to codify a series of questions that 1:1 schools have had to answer, whether they did so deliberately or on the fly. It is meant to prepare you for the many issues that you will face on the way to a successful 1:1 program. What it does not do is speak to the influential, authentic change you will see if your school does this well. When combined with a powerful change in pedagogical practice, a 1:1 computing program can help students and teachers create a learning environment that is truly transformative for all involved. The potential to create new ideas and solve problems when a digital device is in the hands of your students—along with access to the open-ended, accessible tools of Web 2.0—can move schools from enclosed institutions surrounded by four walls to organizations at the forefront of deep and expansive learning.

AB  - The generation of trajectories for a biped robot is a problem which has been largely studied for several years, and many satisfying offline solutions exist for steady-state walking in absence of disturbances. The question is a little more complex when the generation of the desired trajectories of joints or links has to be achieved or adapted online, i.e. in real time, for example when it is wished to strongly synchronize these trajectories with an external motion. This is precisely the problem addressed in this paper. Indeed, we consider the case where the 'master' motion is measured by a position sensor embedded on a human leg. We propose a method to synchronize the motion of a robot or of other device with respect to the output signal of the sensor. The main goal is to estimate as accurately as possible the current phase along the gait cycle. We use for that purpose a model based on a nonlinear oscillator, which we associate an observer. Introducing the sensor output in the observer allows us to compute the oscillator phase and to generate a synchronized multilinks trajectory, at a very low computational cost. The paper also presents evaluation results in terms of robustness against parameter estimation errors and velocity changes in the input. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Personal digital assistants (PDA), particularly Palm Pilots, are popular data collection devices in experience sampling research. The declining availability of such devices, however, has prompted researchers to explore alternative technologies for signaling participants and collecting responses. The present research considers interactive voice response (IVR) methods, which can deliver questions and collect data using common cell phones. Participants completed an experience sampling study using either a PDA (n = 428) or a cell phone under three different conditions (IVR condition n = 98; IVR Callback condition n = 93; IVR Callback Comeback condition n = 94). We found that response rates were higher when people used PDAs (69%) than when they used their cell phones (IVR condition = 51%), but response rates increased when people could call back within a few minutes of missing a signal (IVR Callback condition = 58%) and had a face-to-face meeting with a researcher midweek (IVR Callback Comeback = 64%). The daily life ratings were similar across the conditions. The findings are encouraging for researchers interested in using IVR cell phone methods for ecological momentary assessment, but more work is needed to develop procedures or incentives that increase response rates.

AB  - Background: Children born with permanent hearing loss have the opportunity to receive services earlier as a result of newborn hearing screening (NHS). We conducted a survey to address three aspects within the early hearing detection and intervention (EHDI) process; (1) timeliness of service delivery, (2) hearing device access, and (3) hearing aid management. Parent experiences provide valuable information in identifying existing challenges for these components of the EHDI system. Purpose: The aim was to investigate parent experiences as they access and manage hearing aids for their child. Research Design: A cross-sectional, population-based survey was used. Study Sample: Three hundred fifty-two completed surveys from parents of children born between 1977 and 2010 were returned from 45 states in the United States. Data Collection and Analysis: Responses were obtained online and through the mail, and were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: Over time, the age of hearing loss identification has decreased to a median of 2 mo, age of first hearing aid fitting has decreased to a median of 5 mo, and the delay between hearing loss identification and hearing aid fitting has remained the same with a median of 2 mo. For children born between 2007 and 2010, the top three challenges parents reported in obtaining hearing aids were (1) paying for hearing aids, (2) accepting the. need for hearing aids, and (3) wait time for an appointment. Almost one-half (48%) of the parents reported that they did not receive adequate support from their audiologist in how to check the function of their child's hearing aids. Conclusions: Significant progress has been made over the past two decades in reducing the age of hearing loss identification and hearing aid fitting for children who do not pass the NHS. However, many children continue to experience delays between hearing loss diagnosis and hearing aid fitting that exceed Joint Committee on Infant Hearing recommendations. The experiences parents reported provide valuable information about areas that need further investigation to improve the process for children with hearing loss.

AB  - Objective: This study assessed patient experiences of using an autoinjector device to self-administer subcutaneous belimumab for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Satisfaction, ease and convenience of use, and confidence with the device were assessed, in addition to overall experience with belimumab. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among patients who completed a phase IIb open-label, multi-dose usability, tolerability, and safety study of subcutaneous belimumab (NCT02124798), in which patients receiving intravenous belimumab or subcutaneous belimumab using a prefilled syringe were switched to eight weekly self-administered doses of subcutaneous belimumab using the autoinjector. This follow-up study comprised an online/paper questionnaire and qualitative telephone interviews. Results: In total, 43 patients receiving belimumab completed the questionnaire, 21 of whom also completed a follow-up telephone interview. Qualitative interviews indicated that 17 of 21 (81%) patients had a positive experience using the autoinjector; all patients considered the autoinjector to be convenient. Of the 42 patients who switched from intravenous belimumab to the autoinjector, 32 (76%) expressed a preference for the autoinjector over intravenous administration; reasons included convenience, time saved, cost, and reduced injection pain. The most commonly reported disadvantage of the autoinjector was injection discomfort (n = 5 [24%]; qualitative interview). Compared with intravenous administration, the autoinjector improved ability to work (17 of 29 [59%] of those employed) and carry out daily activities (40%). Conclusion: Patients with SLE reported high levels of satisfaction with the belimumab autoinjector and preferred the autoinjector to intravenous administration, citing advantages such as time saved, cost, and improved ability to work and carry out daily activities.

AB  - This brief paper uses a simple arithmetic framework to classify and explain the performance of developing countries in closing the absolute digital divide. Four categories are created on the basis of two variables, namely, the penetration and rate of growth of mobile phones. The paper answers questions such as: Which countries do well and badly on both variables? Are the countries in these categories drawn from specific regions or similar income levels or is the distribution more random? How can similar countries from the same region appear in two diametrically opposite categories? What does this imply for policy? (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: We examined patient interest in a telehealth model in which the patient supplies the hardware and Internet connectivity to meet with a healthcare provider from his or her home via video call (video appointment). We hoped to understand prospectively the desirability, feasibility, and viability from the patient perspective. Materials and Methods: A phone survey was conducted of a random sample of patients who had been seen in the outpatient setting at a single institution. The sample was stratified by proximity to the local institution with oversampling for patients living outside a 120-mile radius. Results: Out of 500 total patients, 301 patients responded, and 263 met the inclusion criteria. Of those 263 respondents, 38% indicated 'very likely' to accept an invitation to see their provider via video, 28.1% 'somewhat likely,' and 33.8% 'not at all likely.' Of respondents, 75% have broadband, although only 36% reported having a Web camera. The primary factors affecting willingness to participate in a video appointment include comfort in setting up a video call, age, and distance participants would have traveled for an in-clinic appointment. Conclusions: Patient survey data indicate that most patients are likely to be accepting of telehealth care to the home using video call and that most have the required technology. Nevertheless, there are still significant hurdles to effectively implement this adaptation of telehealth care as part of mainstream practice.

AB  - This paper reports on a study of students choosing the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma over state-based curricula in Australian schools. The IB Diploma was initially designed as a matriculation certificate to facilitate international mobility. While first envisaged as a lifestyle agenda for cultural elites, such mobility is now widespread with more people living ‘beyond the nation’ through choice or circumstance. Beck and others highlight how the capacity to cross national borders offers a competitive edge with which to strategically pursue economic and cultural capital. Beck’s ‘border artistes’ are those who use national borders to their individual advantage through reflexive strategy. The study explored the rationales and strategy behind the choice of the IB Diploma curriculum expressed by students in a focus group interview and an online survey. This paper reports on their imagined transnational routes and mobile orientations, and how a localised curriculum limits their imagined mobile futures.

AB  - The convergence of telecommunications, media, and computing represented by the iPhone has been a dream come true for consumers. For policy makers, however, it has created a nightmare. Policy has been outpaced by technological and industrial advances, as regulators are struggling to accommodate a digital and convergent media landscape. Convergence is a concept that has been active in regulatory discourse since the 1960s. Forty-five years later, the regulatory and policy questions have yet to be resolved. The arrival of the Internet and subsequent accelerated convergence of distribution technologies has created a much larger 'regulatory hangover'—the inability of policy to keep pace with technological developments. This disconnect has become particularly pronounced in the language and concerns of media policy, where technology has transformed communications industries and, in turn, wreaked havoc on the foundational rationales for many regulatory paradigms. This chaos presents pressing economic, technological, and cultural dilemmas about regulation in an era of convergence. Among them: How should regulators treat a device that contains as many platforms, paradigms, and services as the iPhone? How will the battles over the Internet's regulatory classification affect the future of the iPhone and similar devices? How do contemporary regulatory politics determine the ways in which services on the iPhone will be classified and regulated in the future? This chapter will address these dynamics by examining the historical trajectory of regulating broadband networks and the role that the iPhone has played in reconceptualizing the importance of platforms and devices to the pipelines that service them.

AB  - Owing to the advancement of mobile and wireless communication technologies, an increasing number of mobile learning studies have been conducted in recent years. In a mobile learning environment, students are able to learn indoors and outdoors with access to online resources at any time. However, whether or not new learning scenarios that combine both real-world contexts and digital-world resources are beneficial to the students has been questioned. Moreover, it is also interesting to probe whether the existing e-learning strategies are effective when situated in those mobile learning scenarios. In this study, an in-field activity on an indigenous culture course of an elementary school with a formative assessment-based learning strategy was conducted to investigate the possible negative effects of mobile learning by analyzing the students’ cognitive load and learning achievement. It is interesting to find that, without proper treatment, the performance of students using those existing online learning strategies, known to be 'effective,' might be disappointing or may even negatively affect the students’ learning achievements. Furthermore, the negative effects could be due to the heavy cognitive load caused by an improper learning design. Such findings offer good references for those who intend to design and conduct mobile learning activities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Given limited extant research, we assessed the use of portable, battery-powered cannabis vaporizers by adult e-cigarette users. Methods: 522 adult vapers completed an online survey. Demographics; lifetime and past-month cannabis vaporization via e-cigarettes/vape-pens; preferences for hash oil, D-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) wax, or dried buds; and cannabis vaporization beliefs and motives were examined. Demographics, age of e-cigarette onset, e-cigarette use frequency, state-level legal status of cannabis, cannabis vaping beliefs/motives, and impulsivity were examined as predictors of lifetime cannabis vaporization, past-month cannabis vaporization, and cannabis vaping frequency. Results: E-cigarette users reported lifetime (17.8%) and past-month (11.5%) cannabis vaporization. Vapers preferred hash oil (LT/PM 45.5/47.5%), THC wax (15.2/32.2%), and dried buds (39.4/35.6%). Motivations to vape cannabis included: it tastes better (39.3/37.9%), is healthier (42.9/39.7%), is easier to conceal/hide (35.7/46.6%), does not smell as strong (42.9/39.7%), is more convenient (42.9/27.6%), and produces a stronger/better high (58.1/40.7%) than smoking cannabis. Lifetime and past-month cannabis vaporization, respectively, were associated with initiating e-cigarette use at an earlier age (odds ratio (OR) = 0.09/0.88), being impulsive (OR = 2.25/3.23), having poor self-control (OR = 2.23/1.85), and vaporizing cannabis because it is easier to conceal/hide (OR = 2.45/2.48) or is more convenient than smoking cannabis (OR = 5.02/2.83). Frequency of vaping cannabis was associated with heavier e-cigarette use (ηp² = 0.10) and impulsivity (ηp2 = 0.09). Conclusions: Adult e-cigarette users are vaporizing cannabis using e-cigarettes/vape-pens. Efforts to curb cannabis vaporization may benefit from targeting impulsivity in users and regulating device features that facilitate or promote convenient, inconspicuous cannabis use.

AB  - Background: Attrition is a persistent issue in online self-help programs, but limited research is available on reasons for attrition or successful methods for improving participant retention. One potential approach to understanding attrition and retention in such programs is to examine person-related variables (eg, beliefs and attitudes) that influence behavior. Theoretical models, such as the Theory of Planned Behavior, that describe conditions influencing human behavior may provide a useful framework for predicting participant retention in online-based program. Objective: We examined predictors of participant retention in a guided online anxiety, depression, and stress self-help program for university students using the theory of planned behavior. We also explored whether age, symptom severity, and type of coaching (ie, email vs phone) affected participant retention. Methods: 65 university students with mild to moderate depression, anxiety, and stress were enrolled in this prospective cohort study. Participants completed a questionnaire based on the theory of planned behavior prior to commencing the online-based program and the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) during the assessment module of the program. Participant retention was operationalized as the number of program modules completed. Results: Perceived control over completing the online program significantly predicted intention to complete the program (F3,62 = 6.7; P = .001; adjusted R²=.2; standardized beta = .436, P = .001). Age (standardized beta = .319, P = .03) and perceived behavioral control (standardized beta = .295, P = .05) predicted the number of program modules completed (F3,61 = 3.20, P = .03, adjusted R₂ = .11). Initial level of distress (ie, symptom severity) did not predict participant retention (P = .55). Participants who chose phone-based coaching completed more program modules than participants who chose email-based coaching (Mann-Whitney’s U = 137; P = .004). Conclusions: Participants’ age, level of perceived behavioral control, and choice of interaction (ie, phone-based or email-based coaching) were found to influence retention in this online-based program.

AB  - Changes in technology, economy, and demography have generated today’s mobile and flexible workplace. These aspects, while leading to more permeable boundaries, render it more difficult to manage the boundaries between life domains. We conducted a quasiexperimental study to evaluate the effects of an intervention teaching mindfulness as a cognitive–emotional segmentation strategy to promote well-being. In all, 191 employees participated in the 3-week online self-training intervention and completed the preintervention– postintervention and follow-up questionnaires. As expected, the experimental group participants compared to the control group participants experienced significantly less emotional exhaustion and negative affect, and significantly more life satisfaction. Moreover, we could show that boundary management competency can be improved with an online-based self-training intervention. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)
AB  - Veränderungen in Technik, Wirtschaft und Demographie haben zu der heutigen mobilen und flexiblen Arbeitswelt beigetragen. Durch diese Entwicklungen verschwimmen die Grenzen zwischen den Lebensbereichen und erschweren die Abgrenzung der Lebensbereiche. Die vorliegende Studie evaluiert die Auswirkungen einer Boundary Management Intervention, die durch die Vermittlung von Achtsamkeit als kognitiv-emotionale Segmentationsstrategie die Abgrenzung der Lebensbereiche und das Wohlbefinden fördern will. Zu diesem Zwecke wurde eine dreiwöchige onlinebasierte Selbstcoaching Intervention entwickelt und durchgeführt. 191 Arbeitnehmende beantworteten die Pre-Post und Follow Up Fragebögen. Die Intervention bestand aus drei Modulen, welche sich jeweils aus einem theoretischen und einem praktischen Teil zusammensetzten. Im ersten Modul lag der Fokus auf der Reflexion der eigenen Abgrenzung der Lebensbereiche sowie der Bedeutung von ‚Abschalten können’ für Erholung und Wohlbefinden. Die Inhalte des zweiten und dritten Moduls basierten auf den zwei Komponenten des Achtsamkeitsmodells von Bishop et al. (2004). Das zweite Modul vermittelte den Interventionsteilnehmenden, inwiefern Achtsamkeit als Selbstregulationsstrategie genutzt werden kann, um Grenzen zwischen Lebensbereichen zu gestalten und im ‚Hier und Jetzt’ zu sein. Im dritten Modul wurde das Konzept der Achtsamkeit vertieft. In den Modulen zwei und drei lernten die Teilnehmenden verschiedene ‚achtsame’ Atemübungen, die sie nutzen können, um Achtsamkeit als kognitiv-emotionale Segmentationsstrategie in ihren Alltag zu integrieren. Mittels eines randomisierten Warte-Kontroll-Gruppen-Designs wurden die Effekte der Intervention überprüft. Wie erwartet berichteten die Teilnehmenden der Experimentalgruppe im Vergleich mit der Kontrollgruppe nach der Intervention ein höheres Maß an selbst eingeschätztem ‚Boundary Management’ (Fähigkeit, Grenzen zwischen Lebensbereichen zu ziehen), ein geringeres Maß an emotionaler Erschöpfung und negativem Affekt und ein höheres Maß an Lebenszufriedenheit. Zwei Wochen später zeigten die Teilnehmenden der Experimentalgruppe noch immer ein höheres Maß an Boundary Management und ein geringeres Maß an emotionaler Erschöpfung im Vergleich zur Kontrollgruppe. Außerdem konnte gezeigt werden, dass die Boundary Management Kompetenz durch ein onlinebasiertes Selbstcoaching gefördert werden kann. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder are at high risk for smoking and experience difficulty with smoking cessation. We designed this clinical demonstration project to provide a low-cost, feasibly implemented smoking cessation intervention that would maximize the number of smokers who accessed the intervention. Five hundred eighty-four veteran smokers were contacted by invitational letters. Interested veterans received follow-up telephone calls using standardized scripts offering three intervention resources: 1) a referral to the National Cancer Institute's Smoking Quitline, 2) web-based counseling, and 3) local Veteran Affairs pharmacologic treatment for smoking cessation. Twenty-three percent of survey recipients participated in the clinical program. Two months after these resources were offered by phone, follow-up phone calls indicated that 25% of participants providing follow-up information reported maintaining smoking abstinence. This clinical demonstration project was associated with a 2.6% impact (i.e., reach [31.1% of smokers accessed intervention] by efficacy [8.4% of those accessing intervention quit]), meaning that 2.6% of the total number of targeted smokers reported 8 week abstinence. Results suggested that this brief, low cost intervention was feasible and promoted smoking cessation in veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder.

AB  - Background: Continued low adherence to physical activity recommendations illustrates the need to refine intervention strategies and increase their effectiveness. The purpose of this study was to conduct formative research related to the development of a next generation of computer-tailored interventions that use online tailored video-messages to increase physical activity. Methods: Five focus groups (n = 30), aimed at males and females, aged between 35 and 60 years, that do not meet the physical activity recommendation, were conducted to allow in-depth discussion of various elements related to the development of an online video-tailored intervention. In addition, a series of questions were delivered to a random sample (n = 1261) of Australians, using CATI survey technology, to gain more information and add a quantitative assessment of feasibility related to the development of the intervention. Focus group data was transcribed, and summarised using Nvivo software. Descriptive and frequency data of the survey was obtained using SPSS 18.0. Results: Nearly all of the focus group participants supported the concept of a video-tailored intervention and 35.8% of survey participants indicated that they would prefer a video-based over a text-based intervention. Participants with a slow internet-connection displayed a lower preference for video-based advice (31.9%); however less than 20% of the survey sample indicated that downloading videos would be slow. The majority of focus group and survey participants did not support the idea of using mobile phones to receive this kind of intervention and indicated that video-tailored messages should be shorter than 5 minutes. Video-delivery of content is very rich in information, which increases the challenge to appropriately tailor content to participant characteristics; focus-group outcomes indicated a large diversity in participant preferences. 52.4% of survey participants indicated that the videos should be convincing and motivating. Conclusions: These results provide valuable information to develop an innovative video-tailored physical activity intervention. The results support the feasibility of such intervention, both in terms of users being ready to participate in it, as well as from a point of view whereby current internet infrastructure is able to cope with the demands of downloading videos. Though promising, a number of specific challenges in the development of these interventions were identified (e.g. the videos need to be short, made professionally, and tailor to a larger number of variables) and will need to be overcome in the development and evaluation of this new type of physical activity intervention.

AB  - Young people are often referred to as digital natives, who are familiar with digital technologies such as computers, the Internet and mobile phones for communication, entertainment and accessing information. As a result scholars have called for an educational approach that bypasses the traditional unidirectional lecture teaching style, and applies a more hands-on, learner-centered method, which includes information and communications technologies (ICT) environments and applications. Building on the outcome of expert interviews, focus group conversations and public test cases in two research projects, i.e., 'Bewaring en Ontsluiting van Multimediale data in VLaanderen' (Archiving and Distribution of Multimedia in Flanders— BOM-VL) and 'Multi-touch Multimedia Table' (MuTable), we want to reflect on the following questions by elaborating on the North Belgian (i.e., Flemish) context: How does the adoption of touch interfaces influence teaching and learning processes in classrooms and what are the implications for teaching models (traditional versus more interactive models)? Besides elaborating on the (attitudinal) bottlenecks and (pedagogical) opportunities of multi-touch displays in educational contexts, we discuss the implications for models of ownership of learning processes.

AB  - This editorial provides an overview of the papers featured in this issue of Literacy. The first paper focus on the historical alignment of pleasurable reading with literary fiction and draw our attention to the variety of literacy practices in which humans engage, and the pleasures that are often generated as we respond to, through and around digital media. Next paper reports the findings of an empirical study which explored the role of the environment in influencing the reader's purpose, text type chosen and device selected. This paper focuses on the sociality of individual silent reading and the readers’ evident awareness of the presence and activity of others when they were reading. The third paper also encompasses awareness of the social nature of the reading experience but in the context of schooling and with reference to 8–14-year olds reading science-information books in Ireland. The next paper raises some more complex questions about the interaction between policy and literacy pedagogy in the social context of the classroom. The final paper links reading for pleasure to the creation of written texts. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Migrants’ personal communities are often composed of both local and transnational ties. So far little is known about how transnationality influences the provision of different dimensions of social support in migrants’ personal communities. Structural and relational characteristics of personal communities as well as attributes of egos are seen to explain how social support is provided. The study addresses the question of which dimensions of support are transferred across national borders as well as what structural, relational and ego-attributional constituents of migrants’ personal communities form social support. It presents data on personal communities from an online survey with n = 234 German migrants in Great Britain. The results show that household, local, national and transnational relationships provide a wide array of social support. Though being restricted in the tangible dimensions of social support (instrumental, social companionship), transnational ties provide more intangible (emotional) support. Conflicts are less prevalent in transnational relationships than within the household. Furthermore, the multi-level analysis of the ego-centred network data shows that both structural characteristics of personal communities (size, density) and ego attributes (e.g. age and gender of ego, time of residence in country of residence) are less relevant than relational characteristics (e.g. contact frequency, tie strength and esp. transnationality) in explaining how migrants receive social support. This result challenges a structural approach to the explanation of social support in personal communities of mobile people. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Introduction: Multi-site tobacco cessation trials could benefit from remote biochemical verification for tobacco use without invasive, time-consuming, or expensive collection processes. To the authors' knowledge, there have been no previous studies examining the predictive validity of oral fluid swabs for the detection of cotinine levels with samples collected off-site and mailed for on-site interpretation. Methods: Tobacco users were recruited through an online survey and participants who met the initial eligibility criteria were invited to take part. Those who elected to enroll provided two positive iScreen Oral Fluid Device (OFD) cotinine test samples during an in-office visit. One sample was used as a control and stored in a temperature-regulated location, while the other was mailed from one of ten surrounding counties. Mailing method and time from collection to mailing were varied, and results were assessed against control samples. Results: Twenty tobacco users enrolled in the study. Participants ranged in age from 18 to 31 (M = 16.45, SD = 1.54). Several types of tobacco use were reported, with electronic cigarettes the most commonly reported product. None of the mailed sample interpretations changed from pre- to post-mailing, with up to twenty-one days from sample collection to results confirmation. Conclusions: Results indicate that the use of mailed oral swabs may be an easy to use, reliable, and low-cost option for the detection of cotinine in tobacco users when in-person collection is not feasible. Test result interpretations were found to be unchanged after mailing, and after extended post-collection time gaps. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Reviews the book e-Trust: Forming relationships in the online world edited by Karen S. Cook, Chris Snijders, Vincent Buskens and Coye Cheshire (2009). Internet use is so widespread, at least in Western societies, that the question of trust in the virtual world and whether it mirrors trust in the real world must be of considerable interest to sociologists. With continuing concerns about crime, privacy and surveillance online and the real possibility that more and more services, commercial or otherwise, will be going online, the subject matter of  e-Trust involves us all. However the style of this book may not be to everyone’s taste. Somewhat functionalist in approach, e-Trust hails from a management science or information systems stable and adopts an objectivist and largely quantitative, rather than interpretivist, approach. It focuses on laboratory experiments and bounded studies, rather than seeking to interview and understand, in their own terms, those who may be affected by the issues addressed in this book. Hence, the user voice speaks to us from some distance and the question of how users from different demographics feel about trust in the virtual world is not addressed. Some important topics are not covered. For instance, social networking, which has assumed considerable importance in a short space of time with many concerns about privacy, risk and trust expressed on a variety of fronts, is barely mentioned. We also gain little idea of where users are undertaking their transactions, and whether that matters, given that Internet access is increasingly done on mobile devices. Also there is the question not so much of whether traders and users trust each other but the potenial for fraud by third parties. The book focuses almost exclusively on commercial transactions and formal ways of how reputation and trust may be measured and represented. Rather than a broad sweep of the on-line trust landscape which we might have expected from the title e-Trust: Forming Relationships in the Online World, we have, instead, a more circumscribed work. Nevertheless, the issue of buying things safely on the Internet and how we are to know whether it is reasonable for buyer and seller to trust each other will affect us more and more and if there are formal mechanisms which can facilitate this and help us to put our trust in an invisible and unknown online retailer, so much the better. Given that the design of computer systems involves turning often quite intangible ideas and requirements into something that must be expressed formally to be programmed into a computer system, then the job has to be done somewhere and, if the book is seen as working at that level then it can be understood to contain some interesting and important research.

AB  - Mobile devices with touch screens, such as tablets are increasingly used in classrooms. Pragmatic advantages are seen in high mobility during computer-based learning due to a high portability of mobile devices and an easy online access to learning applications at places in and outside classrooms. From a psychological perspective, it is of special interest to examine how different modes of interaction with learning materials (e.g. through apps on tablets) affect performance and motivation. For example, touch screens can afford rather natural gestures and embodied interaction. For various contexts, the use of gestures to interact with information presentations (e.g. with 2-D and 3-D visualizations) has been shown to be beneficial for solving spatial tasks. It is of interest whether use of gestures can also improve learning from dynamic visual information presented on touch-based devices. We present and discuss a study in which we focused on the question of whether, for elementary school students, solving spatial tasks can be enhanced by using touch-gestures on mobile devices. Two conditions of spatial rotation tasks were compared using a within-and between subject design: an interactive, touch-based app allowing to physically rotate objects and a paper-based, static version. Elementary school students worked with both conditions, though in different orders. Findings suggest that the app-based, dynamic version improves task solving significantly with regard to success rate, mental and temporal efficiency. However, results clearly show that effects mostly exist only after children had first completed the paper-based, static trial of tasks in which they needed to mentally rotate the objects. The results indicate an additive, enhancing effect of the touch-based, dynamic interaction mode especially for children who already are capable of solving the tasks by using mental rotation processes.

AB  - The following questions are addressed in this chapter: How can leaders ensure they are proficient users and consumers of technology and supporters of a school vision that places technology as an essential part of the curriculum? What are the characteristics schools and universities need to educate a workforce that is capable of engaging in active learning and lifelong learning, higher cognitive skills, and collaboration and of using effective coping skills? What are the effective and efficient uses of technology for teaching and learning that enable faculty to feel comfortable using the technology to teach? How can leaders understand that different cultures use and perceive technology in different ways? What are the skills leaders need to help educators see assistive technology as a potential tool the student can use to improve his or her functioning or minimize the effects of his or her disability? How can leaders use the various models to help educational teams select the appropriate technology and understand that assistive technology is a highly integrated system, not just a device? The following topics are discussed: 21st-century skills, the digital divide, the school administrator of today, professional development in schools, technology for management, and technologies for a diverse student population.

AB  - In this paper, I argue for a need to expand our understanding of the role that self-help plays in the constitution of identities. Using the example of the Third Culture Kid (TCK) industry, I argue that self-help acts as a space of biopower through its role in managing the emotional experience of having been globally mobile as a child. To do this, the paper looks at how the TCK, as a subject, is surfaced as comfort in relation to the ascribed grief and insecurity of identity that is associated with childhood global mobility. Data are derived from a multi-sited ethnography, including a narrative analysis of TCK literature, reader discussions, participant observation at a TCK event and an online survey. The argument contributes to scholarly critiques of self-help by examining processes of production and consumption of TCK subjectivity enacted through the TCK industry. Thereby, the paper contends that in researching self-help we need a wider understanding of its production and consumption, how people are persuaded to use it, and how they respond to ideas presented within it.

AB  - The rise of online competitors and increasingly well-informed customers have spurred stationary retailers to take measures to increase the quality of face-to-face selling as a key differentiator. Mobile sales assistants (MSAs) represent an intensively discussed technological approach to address these challenges in the salesperson–customer dyad. However, in many cases, salespeople do not or only sporadically use MSAs. Prior research provides inadequate answers as to why this is the case, as extant technology acceptance and resistance theories have limited applicability to MSAs. To address these research gaps, the authors conduct a qualitative, theory-building approach and identify 21 factors associated with resistance. In a subsequent quantitative survey study, they validate these factors and refine their conceptual structure. The results show that several largely unknown factors are associated with salespeople’s resistance to MSA use: The three higher-order constructs, ‘incongruence’, ‘relationship deterioration’, and ‘operational imperfection’, are newly introduced to the literature on technology resistance. The findings extend prior technology acceptance and resistance theories and provide comprehensive insights for retail managers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine sleep habits (i.e., bedtimes and rising times) and their association with nighttime text messaging in 15- to 17-year-old adolescents. This cross-sectional study analyzed data from a web-based survey of adolescent students attending secondary schools in southern Sweden (N = 278, 50% female). Less than 8 hr of time in bed during school nights was significantly associated with more sleep difficulties, wake time variability on school days and weekends, daytime tiredness, and less enjoyment at school (all ps < .05). Sending and/or receiving text messages (Short Message Service [SMS]) at night was significantly associated with later bedtimes, shorter time in bed, daytime tiredness during school, and irregular sleep habits (p < .05). These findings highlight the importance of regular, consistent sleep habits and the problems associated with sleeping with a cell phone in the bedroom.

AB  - We investigate people’s attitudes toward the possible use of negotiation support systems (NSS) in different social contexts and the consequences for their design. To explore functional requirements and social acceptance in different use contexts, we followed a three-step approach. In the first step, we conducted a number of focus groups with negotiation experts. Second, we conducted focus groups with potential users. The focus groups were a qualitative exploration of people’s ideas about NSS that led to design guidelines for mobile NSS. Third, we conducted an online survey (a) to find out in which situations people consider a mobile NSS socially acceptable, (b) to find the factors and relationships that influence this acceptance in the different situations and social contexts, and (c) to investigate the consequences of people’s attitudes toward NSS for the system’s design. The data showed that subjective norm is an important factor influencing the intention to use the system and that the acceptance of NSS depends on the use context. Therefore, we argue that NSS should be designed not only merely as tools being used in the actual negotiation but also as social devices harnessing social networks to provide support in all negotiation phases.

AB  - As online communication is more and more integrated in everyday life to support and maintain existing social ties, this study examined the factors associated with preference of face to face, phone or online conversations. A contextual framework that emphasizes the role of relationship origin, relationship intensity and content of communication on communication channel choice among adolescents was empirically tested. Based on a nationwide survey in Israel, it was found that communication content, relationship origin and place of residence affect the preference of face to face and online communication. Phone communication appears to be a more non specific channel to conduct personal and non personal conversations and relationship origin did not affect its use. These findings suggest that relationship origin is important, and face to face communication is preferred for ties that were initiated face to face and online communication for ties that were initiated online. For this sample of regular population, there is no indication that online communication tends to be personal or hyper personal. The use of all the communication channels is preferred to the maintenance of existing ties and is less used for the creation of new ties. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Purpose/Objective: Our goal was to examine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of an app-based coaching intervention (Social Participation and Navigation; SPAN) to help survivors of acquired brain injury attain social participation goals. Research Method/Design: This is a nonrandomized pilot trial of SPAN, including 15 adolescents (9 with traumatic brain injury, 6 with brain tumor) between the ages of 14–22. The SPAN intervention consisted of a mobile app to support the development and implementation of social participation goals, weekly video-conference coaching sessions to identify goals and step-by-step action plans, and online didactic materials. Assessments were completed pre- and postintervention. Satisfaction with the intervention, confidence in the adolescents’ ability to participate in and plan social activities and manage their emotions and behaviors, and frequency and satisfaction with social participation were assessed via self- and parent-report questionnaires developed for this project. Behavior problems, social competence, and social problems were measured by using the Child Behavior Checklist and the Youth Self-Report. Results: High levels of participant and parent satisfaction were reported. Increases in parent-reported frequency of social participation and teen-reported confidence in their ability to participate and develop social participation goals and plans were observed. A decline in parent-reported total problems, internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and social problems was noted. Conclusion/Implications: Results support the feasibility of the program, because participants were able to successfully meet with their coaches and use the app to develop and accomplish social participation goals. Further research will be needed to refine the app and program, particularly when reaching out to populations beyond traumatic brain injury.

AB  - Background: Patients with single-sided deafness (SSD), where one ear has an unaidable hearing loss and the other ear has normal or aidable hearing, often complain of difficulties understanding speech and localizing sound sources, and report a higher self-perceived hearing disability. Patients with SSD may benefit from using contralateral routing of signal (CROS) or bilateral contralateral routing of the signal (BiCROS) amplification. Dissatisfaction of previously available (Bi)CROS devices has been reported, such as, interfering transmissions, low-fidelity sound quality, poor 'user-friendly' set-up, and a bulky and cosmetically cumbersome appearance. Purpose: Recent advances in hearing aid technology have improved (Bi)CROS hearing aids; however, these devices have not been experimentally evaluated. We hypothesized that newer technology with reports of improved digital signal processing, wireless transmission, and physical design would be as good, or better than, our participants' previous-generation BiCROS systems. Research Design: A within-subjects, pretest-posttest design was executed. Study Sample: Thirty-nine veterans (one female, 38 males; mean age = 74 yr, range = 49-85 yr) from the Audiology Section of the Bay Pines Veterans Affair Healthcare System participated. All participants were previously experienced BiCROS hearing aid users with varying degrees of sensorinerual hearing impairment in their better ear. Intervention: Participants were provided at least 4 wk of consistent use with the new BiCROS. Data Collection and Analysis: Participants completed three research visits. At Visit 1, with their previous BiCROS, and at Visit 3, with their new BiCROS, the following objective and subjective measures were obtained: (1) soundfield speech-in-noise testing using the Words-In-Noise (WIN) test; (2) speech, spatial, and qualities of the hearing scale (SSQ) questionnaire; (3) selected questions from the MarkeTrak questionnaire; and, (4) three open-ended questions. Data were analyzed using parametric and nonparametric statistics. Results: Overall, the objective (WIN) and subjective (SSQ, MarkeTrak, and open-ended questions) measures indicated that the new BiCROS provided better outcomes than the previous BiCROS system. In addition, an overlap of favorable results was seen across measures. Conclusions: Of the 39 participants, 95% reported improvements with the new BiCROS and chose to utilize the device regularly. The favorable objective and subjective outcomes indicate that the new BiCROS system is as good, or better than, what was previously utilized by our sample of veterans.

AB  - Experience sampling or ecological momentary assessment offers unique insights into how people think, feel, and behave in their natural environments. Because the method is able to capture situational variation as it happens in 'real time,' experience sampling has become an increasingly popular method in social and personality, psychology, and beyond. With the ubiquity of smartphone ownership and the recent technical advances, conducting experience sampling studies on participants’ own devices has become increasingly easy to do. Here, we present one reliable, user-friendly, highly customizable, and cost-effective solution. The web-based application, SurveySignal, integrates the idea of using short message service (SMS) messages as signals and reminders, according to fixed or random schedules and of linking these signals to mobile surveys designed with common online survey software. We describe the method and customizable parameters and then present evaluation results from nine social–psychological studies conducted with SurveySignal (overall N = 1,852). Mean response rates averaged 77% and the median response delay to signals was 8 min. An experimental manipulation of the reminder signal in one study showed that installing a reminder SMS led to a 10% increase in response rates. Next to advantages and limitations of the SMS approach, we discuss how ecologically valid research methods such as smartphone experience sampling can enrich psychological research.

AB  - Comments on an article by Megan M. Smith, Geoffrey Tremont and Brian R. Ott (see record [rid]2009-03086-010[/rid]). The article by by Smith, Tremont, and Ott, comes at a critical time in our planning for the future of Alzheimer’s diagnosis and care; but, this review also piques a number of moral and ethical questions that merit discussion and thoughtful debate. How would the person be informed about the results of the screening? Would a 'live' person deliver the results by phone, or would it be a digital computer voice indicating that the person should seek further evaluation? I would hope the results are given in a manner that does not frighten the person unduly and explains what the screen really means and how they can get more help.

AB  - The music industry in the 21st century uses digital technology in a wide range of applications including performance, composition and in recording and publishing. Much of this digital technology is freely available via downloads from the internet, as part of software included with computers when they are purchased and via applications that are available for some mobile phones. Such technology is transforming music and the way people approach many traditional music activities. This paper is about transformative practices that are underway in some secondary school music classrooms. Practices are being shaped by the culture of the schools and the students that they recruit. We describe the perceptions and practices of nine music teachers in four New Zealand secondary schools with regard to digital technology and how they are changing their work in their classroom. Data collection techniques include interviews, observation and a questionnaire. The data were subjected to two stages of thematic analysis. Grounded analysis was used to allow the teachers' voices emerge. This was then followed by the application of five themes identified in the literature on pedagogic change prompted by teachers' adoption of digital technologies.

AB  - In recent years, there has been a growing interest in enabling autonomous social robots to interact with people. However, many questions remain unresolved regarding the social capabilities robots should have in order to perform this interaction in an ever more natural manner. In this paper, we tackle this problem through a comprehensive study of various topics involved in the interaction between a mobile robot and untrained human volunteers for a variety of tasks. In particular, this work presents a framework that enables the robot to proactively approach people and establish friendly interaction. To this end, we provided the robot with several perception and action skills, such as that of detecting people, planning an approach and communicating the intention to initiate a conversation while expressing an emotional status. We also introduce an interactive learning system that uses the person’s volunteered assistance to incrementally improve the robot’s perception skills. As a proof of concept, we focus on the particular task of online face learning and recognition. We conducted real-life experiments with our Tibi robot to validate the framework during the interaction process. Within this study, several surveys and user studies have been realized to reveal the social acceptability of the robot within the context of different tasks.

AB  - Lectures are designed to deliver new information to a large group of students. Apart from actual lecturing, lecturers may also encourage elaboration of learning material with advanced instructions, like advance organizer, summaries and repetitions as well as questions. Prerequisite to learning from lectures is that students focus on the lecture and cognitively process what is being presented. In today’s lectures, mobile devices, (i.e. laptops and smartphones), may aid students to research additional information online or to take notes, but may also distract students. In this descriptive study, 86 students with 91 mobile devices out of five lectures were observed with respect to how they utilized mobile devices for lecture-related and -unrelated activities. Additionally, we observed 21 lecturers and coded their behavior. The results indicate that lecturing correlates only slightly with student activities. Students use media mostly in a lecture-unrelated way. Giving negative feedback seems to foster students’ lecture-unrelated media use. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Computer technologies have been introduced into schools since about 1960, with large scale deployment starting in the 1980s once personal computers became widely available and affordable. A second wave of deployment saw the networking of computers, first in the form of classroom based local-area network (LAN), and more recently the connection to the Internet. More recent trends include such developments as the introduction of interactive whiteboards into classrooms, and the establishment of 1:1 computing (one digital device per student) in some systems. However, the major meta-analyses available at this time do not address these more recent developments—one might also add the increasing interest in mobile and cloud computing amongst them—but focus on the classic question: Do students in classes where computers are used profit from this compared to students in classes where no computers are used?

AB  - Technology is a mobile and integral part of many work places, and computers and other information and communication technology have made many users’ work life easier, but technology can also contribute to problems in the cognitive work environment and, over time, create technostress. Much previous research on technostress has focused on the use of digital technology and its effects, measured by questionnaires, but in order to further examine how technostress arises in the modern workplace, a wider perspective on interactions between people and technology is needed. This paper applies a distributed cognition perspective to human–technology interaction, investigated through an observational field study. Distributed cognition focuses on the organisation of cognitive systems, and technostress in this perspective becomes an emergent phenomenon within a complex and dynamic socio-technical system. A well-established questionnaire was also used (for a limited sample), to gain a frame of reference for the results from the qualitative part of the study. The implications are that common questionnaire-based approaches very well can and should be complemented with a broader perspective to study causes of technostress. Based on the present study, a redefinition of technostress is also proposed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - [Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 45(4) of Behavior Research Methods (see record [rid]2013-42932-030[/rid]). In the original article, in Table 2, the Beta estimate for Trait social anxiety predicting Negative affect should be changed from 5.881 to 0.023, and it’s now nonsignificant (i.e., no double asterisks). Though a more minor correction, the Beta estimate for State social anxiety predicting Depression should be changed from .200 to .198. On the tenth page of the article, under Results, the second sentence should also be changed to: 'Trait social anxiety did not significantly predict negative affect (p =.594), positive affect (p =.622), or depression (p =.167) over time.'] Ecological momentary assessment (EMA), or the repeated assessment of individuals’ behaviors and experiences over time, is a methodologically advantageous approach to the study of psychological constructs. Recently, advances in computer technology have allowed for EMA research to be conducted in a more convenient, automated, and secure manner by administering surveys on participants’ telephones and storing the results directly to a central server. The present article introduces TelEMA, an easy-to-use, low-cost telephone assessment platform for clinical and research applications. A single server running TelEMA can be shared among many experimenters, studies, and participants simultaneously. TelEMA routes telephone calls and text messages through a third-party service, so experimenters may conduct studies with no up-front cost or technical expertise. TelEMA provides a secure Web interface for experimenters or clinicians to design studies, enroll participants, monitor compliance, and collate response data from anywhere. Participants complete surveys using their own telephones. Surveys may contain keypress or voice recording questions, and the timing and content of each survey may be randomized and customized. A pilot study was conducted in which individuals used the TelEMA system to complete four randomly timed surveys per day for one week; the surveys assessed state affect and social anxiety. Results indicated that participants found TelEMA easy to use and secure, and compliance rates were on par with other EMA methods using mobile devices. Overall, Tel-EMA is a practical and robust system that enables fast and inexpensive deployment of EMAs. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - There is growing interest in the potential value of using phone applications that can monitor driver behaviour (Smartphone Driver Support Systems, ‘SDSSs’) in mitigating risky driving by young people. However, their value in this regard will only be realised if young people are willing to use this technology. This paper reports the findings of a study in which a novel structural model of willingness to use SDSSs was tested. Grounded in the driver monitoring and Technology Acceptance (TA) research literature, the model incorporates the perceived risks and gains associated with potential SDSS usage and additional social cognitive factors, including perceived usability and social influences. A total of 333 smartphone users, aged 18–24, with full Irish driving licenses completed an online questionnaire examining willingness or Behavioural Intention (BI) to uptake a SDSS. Following exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, structural equation modelling indicated that perceived gains and social influence factors had significant direct effects on BI. Perceived risks and social influence also had significant indirect effects on BI, as mediated by perceived gains. Overall, this model accounted for 72.5% of the variance in willingness to uptake SDSSs. Multi-group structural models highlighted invariance of effects across gender, high and low risk drivers, and those likely or unlikely to adopt novel phone app technologies. These findings have implications for our understanding of the willingness of young drivers to adopt and use SDSSs, and highlight potential factors that could be targeted in behavioural change interventions seeking to improve usage rates.

AB  - Recent work suggests that text messaging impairs simulated and actual driving performance and that this impairment exceeds that of conversing on a cell phone while driving. Additionally, research has shown that text messaging is common in several countries, and despite drivers acknowledging the high risk involved in doing so, drivers continue to engage in this behaviour—regardless of legislation banning it. A nationwide online survey in New Zealand, of 1057 respondents, collected anonymous self-report data regarding the frequency of cell phone use (conversing and text messaging) while driving, beliefs concerning the safety of conversing or text messaging while driving. This article presents part of the results of that study—focusing on text messaging behaviour and risk perception regarding text messaging while driving. Over half of respondents surveyed reported sending or reading between 1 and 5 text messages while driving in a typical week. Despite this, 89% of participants agreed that text messaging while driving in general impairs driving performance. There were no gender differences between the number of text messages read and sent. Age was found to be an important indicator of participant’s willingness to engage in text messaging while driving, with younger drivers more likely to engage in this behaviour. The implications of these findings for future research and countermeasure development are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Despite decades of research demonstrating the efficacy of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), many clinicians have not adopted it into their practice. In an effort to increase the number of trained clinicians, the International OCD Foundation (IOCDF) developed a nationwide intensive training program, the Behavior Therapy Training Institute (BTTI). We report the first data on the BTTI. We emailed a 30-item online survey to all clinicians (N = 350) who attended one of twelve BTTI workshops between 2008 and 2011. One hundred and sixty one individuals (53%) responded. Participants reported more than moderate use of all BTTI skills. Expert phone consultation and peer consultation after the training were associated with greater skills use. The most commonly reported barrier to skill use was difficulty integrating the techniques into their practice because of time or an inability to leave the office. The majority of participants also reported an increase in OCD-related referrals after the BTTI. Limitations of this work, suggestions for improvement, and the implications of our findings for broader dissemination efforts are discussed.

AB  - Evidence of comparability is generally needed whenever there are variations in the conditions of an assessment administration, including variations introduced by the administration of an assessment on multiple digital devices (e.g., tablet, laptop, desktop). This article is meant to provide a comprehensive examination of issues relevant to the comparability of scores across devices, and as such provide a starting point in designing and implementing a research agenda to support the comparability of any assessment program. This work starts with a conceptual framework rooted in the idea of a comparability claim—a conceptual statement about how each student is expected to perform on each of the devices in question. Then a review of the available literature is provided, focusing on how aspects of the devices (touch screens, keyboards, screen size, and displayed content) and aspects of the assessments (content area and item type) relate to student performance and preference. Building on this literature, recommendations to minimize threats to comparability are then provided. The article concludes with ways to gather evidence to support claims of comparability.

AB  - Tools and other artifacts can be seen as extensions of our human selves. For example, hand tools can be seen as extensions of the hand's ability to grasp, strike, or dig, and vehicles extend the ability of our legs to take us places. Likewise, information technology (IT) tools can extend and support the limited cognitive systems and abilities of humans. For example, memory storage systems, from writing tablets to books to digital memory devices, vastly extend the limits of our long-term memories. The use of computer windows, or any device with active files, can foreground information far beyond the limitations of our human working memory capacity, functionally extending this important cognitive ability. Cognitive systems upon which we rely every day include lower-order cognitive systems, such as sensation, perception, pattern recognition, working memory, and long-term memory; as well as higher-order cognitive systems, such as language systems, concept formation, visualization, and reasoning. What does cognition have to do with creativity? How can IT tools extend and enhance the cognitive systems and abilities that give rise to creative ideas? How can the efficacy of IT tools for enhancing creativity be analyzed and tested empirically? This chapter addresses these questions. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Purpose: Timely and adequate rehabilitation after a stroke is crucial to maximising recovery. A way of increasing treatment access could be through robots, which would aid therapists in providing post-stroke rehabilitation. This research sought to discover the needs and preferences of therapists with respect to a robot that focuses on upper limb rehabilitation. Understanding requirements for devices could help to increase integration into clinical practice. Methods: An international online survey was distributed through professional organisations and e-mail list services to therapists. The survey contained 85 items covering topics such as therapist background and treatment approach, rehabilitation aims and robotic rehabilitation device attributes. Results: Data were analysed for 233 respondents, most of whom were physiotherapists and occupational therapists from Australia, Canada and USA. Top attributes included: facilitating a variety of arm movements, being usable while seated, giving biofeedback to clients, having virtual activities specific to daily living, being useful in-home and having resistance adjustable to client needs. In addition, the device should cost under 6000 USD. Conclusions: Findings from this survey provide guidance for technology developers regarding therapists’ specifications for a robotic device for upper limb rehabilitation. In addition, findings offer a better understanding of how acceptance of such devices may be facilitated. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The topic of this chapter is social relations among disabled youths in Norway and the opportunities or barriers that are associated with information and communication technology (ICT). This chapter focuses on the significance of personal computers (computers) and mobile phones (mobiles) to inclusion and exclusion processes for disabled youth in relation to their peer group, social capital, and identity negotiations. Specifically, the chapter discusses when, how, for whom, and with what consequences ICT can provide new opportunities or create new barriers for disabled youths to participate in social relations. It illustrates how engagement in digital communication and interaction is vital to social participation by describing the experiences of Norwegian disabled youths between the ages 15 and 20 as they interact with ICT as a form of communication. The chapter concludes that ICT enhances opportunities for social relationships through: Communication and interaction with peers on the 'digital town square;' Participation in shared digital activities, on and around the computer screen; Displaying and sharing digital competencies, in real and in virtual contexts; and Taking part in the permeability of the real and the virtual in everyday life. However, the chapter also illustrates how ICT can create inhibiting barriers for young disabled people. These barriers are found to emerge in settings where the interactive use and account of ICT is experienced by the young disabled people as: Discouraging of social relationships; Difficult, confusing, and exerting; and A risky social setting where ICT becomes a tool for harassment. Breaking down disabling barriers and the purposeful provision of equal opportunities for participation and development for disabled people is a declared goal in official Norwegian documents (Norwegian Official Report, 2001, p. 22; White Paper no. 40, 2002-2003). The government claims that removal of disabling barriers in society, including those created by technology, and increased accessibility is vital if this goal is to be achieved. In achieving the goal of removing disabling barriers, the Norwegian government points to a need for more social research on the interactions between environments, disabling barriers, and the consequences of social change (Full Participation for All? Development Trends, 2001-2006; Government's Action Plan for Increased Accessibility, 2004; Ministry of Modernisation, 2009; State of Affairs on Accessibility in Norway, 2006). This chapter explores social changes in communication and interpersonal interaction and also illustrates how the increasingly widespread dissemination and utilization of ICT in the population can mediate new opportunities for communication, interaction, and participation for many disabled youths. On the other hand, ICT can also create new barriers for disabled youths. In the abundant literature on theories guiding the field of ICT and young people in general, Livingstone (2003) found two key questions to be essential. (1) Are young people a special group? (2) Is ICT a distinctive technology? In writing this chapter, I acknowledge three broad assumptions guiding the field. First, I recognize the fact that children and youth play a key role in establishing emerging ICT-related practices. Second, I recognize a need to go beyond the issue of access and contextualize ICT uses and impacts within everyday life. Third, I recognize that new technology not only adds to the existing mix of available technology but also transforms the way in which the latter are perceived and used (Livingstone, 2003). ICT manifests in diverse practices that vary as much as the contexts in which it is used. Thus, ICT, social context, and action are found to be an inseparable phenomena, each influencing each other (Lievrouw & Livingstone, 2006; Valentine & Holloway, 2002).

AB  - Because campus officials are relying on personal communication technologies to communicate with students, a question arises about access and usage. Although communication technologies are popular among college students, some evidence suggests that differences exist in ownership and use. We examined patterns of student ownership and use of cell phones and use of instant messaging, focusing on three predictors of digital inequality: gender, ethnicity, and income. Logistic and hierarchical linear regression analyses were used to analyze results from 4,491 students. The odds that female and white students owned cell phones were more than twice as high as for men and African-American students. Students in the $100,000–$149,000 per year income bracket were more than three times as likely to own a cell phone than those from the median bracket. However, being female, African-American, and/ or from the highest income brackets was positively predictive of the number of text messages sent and the amount of time spent talking on a cell phone per week. We found no differences between students on the use of instant messaging. Implications of these results, as well as areas for further research, are provided.

AB  - This study investigates the effects of cultural orientation and the degree of disdain for robots on the preferred conversational styles in human-to-robot interactions. 203 participants self-reported on questionnaires through a computer-based online survey. The two requesting situations were intended to simulate the participants' interactions with humanoid social robots through an Internet video-phone medium of communication. Structural equation modeling was performed to examine the mediating role of mechanistic disdain between multicultural orientation and conversational constraints. The findings reveal that between the two dimensions of multicultural orientation, only open-mindedness inversely influences mechanistic disdain. Mechanistic disdain, in turn, negatively affects three face-related conversational constraints, thereby leading to a lesser concern for robots' feelings, for minimizing impositions on robots, and for avoiding robots' negative evaluations. The implications of our findings on humans' relations with virtual robot entities and on the future development of humanoid robots are discussed.

AB  - Retailing industry has evolved drastically, especially in the past two decades due to the mobile technology. A recent empirical research study proved that the public use of mobile devices can be explained by the extension of the self, Hahn and Kim (2013) suggesting that fashion and appearance related constructs are imperative to understand young adult consumers’ mobile use intentions. With an aim to better understand the consumer’s mobile usage behavior, the researchers adopted psychographic characteristics such as fashion involvement, self-monitoring tendency, and proclivity of experimenting with appearance to gauge the individual consumers’ mobile dependency. Using an online and paper survey, we collected 273 usable responses from college-aged consumers. T-tests revealed that individuals, who had a higher degree of one’s sensitivity of self-monitoring, exhibited a significantly higher mean scores in fashion involvement, experimenting with appearance, and mobile dependency. A similar pattern was found among the ones with higher degree of ability of self-monitoring tendency as well. Discussion and pragmatic implications to the retail industry are provided.

AB  - Research using Internet surveys is an emerging field, yet research on the legitimacy of using Internet studies, particularly those targeting sensitive topics, remains under-investigated. The current study builds on the existing literature by exploring the demographic differences between Internet panel and RDD telephone survey samples, as well as differences in responses with regard to experiences of intimate partner violence perpetration and victimization, alcohol and substance use/abuse, PTSD symptomatology, and social support. Analyses indicated that after controlling for demographic differences, there were few differences between the samples in their disclosure of sensitive information, and that the online sample was more socially isolated than the phone sample. Results are discussed in terms of their implications for using Internet samples in research on sensitive topics. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Nowadays the web map (E-map) is an indispensable wayfinding tool in the Internet-based society. However, its usability will vary with a different navigational technique or input device. The navigational techniques currently adopted by various web maps were investigated and analyzed. Moreover, two input devices, i.e., the mouse and the touch screen, were operated in four navigational techniques to study the differences in their functions and performances. Later, the research findings were utilized to develop a new navigational technique. The research was divided into two stages. During the first stage, all the navigational techniques in current use were investigated and compared. Then, based on the results of analysis, the enhanced navigator with continuous control (ENCC) was designed. During the second stage, the searching and browsing techniques of different web maps were simulated. Afterwards, the mouse and the touch screen were employed separately to conduct simulation tests in the following navigational techniques: (1) combined panning buttons (CPB), (2) distributed panning buttons (DPB), (3) ENCC, and (4) G&D. A total of 36 participants took part in the trials. At the end of the experiment, the operational performances of the participants were studied through the two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA); besides, the subjective evaluation questionnaires were answered. It was discovered that the mouse did better than the touch screen in the four navigational techniques. Besides, among the four techniques, ENCC showed the best performance. Capable of continuous control and continuous display, the ENCC interface was upgraded in terms of operational speed and directional control. The findings can be used as a reference in the design of web maps. Also, it is suggested that ENCC should be widely applied to touch screens and mice so that the navigation of information space may be facilitated.

AB  - Previous studies have shown a relationship between the use of communications technology and well-being, particularly mediated through its effect on personal relationships. However, there is some debate over whether this effect is positive or negative. The present study explored this issue further, examining whether the effect varies depending on the type of communications technology, and the nature of the personal relationship. An online survey was conducted with 3421 participants in three countries (Australia, UK and US). It examined the use of ten communication methods, overall satisfaction with life and satisfaction with four different kinds of relationships (close and extended family, and close and distant friends). Results indicate that richer communication methods, which include non-verbal cues, were positively associated with both overall satisfaction with life and satisfaction with relationships. These methods included face-to-face communication, and phone and video calls. Conversely, more restricted methods, such as text messaging and instant messaging, were negatively associated with both variables. Social networking was negatively associated with overall satisfaction, but not with satisfaction with relationships. The strength of the association between a communications method and satisfaction with a relationship varied depending on the type of relationship, but whether it was positive or negative did not change.

AB  - Chinese classrooms, whether on school grounds or online, have long suffered from a lack of interactivity. Many online classes simply provide recorded instructor lectures, which only reinforces the negative effects of passive non participatory learning. At Shanghai Jiaotong University, researchers and developers actively seek technologic interventions that can greatly increase interactivity in large blended classes. They developed a cutting-edge mobile learning system that can deliver live broadcasts of real-time classroom teaching to students with mobile devices. Their system allows students to customize means of content-reception based on when and where they tune into the broadcast. The system also supports short text messaging and instant polls. Through these venues, students can ask questions and make suggestions in real time, and the instructor can address them immediately. This article describes this system in detail, and also reports results from a formal implementation of the system in a blended English classroom of 1000 students (with about 800 being online). As the data reveal, m-learning activities can much better engage students in the learning process. Students in this class changed from passive learners to truly engaged learners who are behaviorally, intellectually and emotionally involved in their learning tasks.

AB  - Aim: This study aims to address the gap in research and contribute to the body of knowledge on the perspectives assistive technology device users have toward their devices. Method: Mixed methods were used to better understand the impact of mobility assistive technology devices (MATDs) on participation for individuals with disabilities. The Functional Mobility Assessment was administered in conjunction with two qualitative questions developed by the research team allowing participants to expound on the impact of their MATD experience. Participants were recruited online via the National Spinal Cord Injury Association website and in-person at Abilities Expo in Atlanta, Georgia, and the International Seating Symposium in Nashville, Tennessee. Results: Results are consistent with findings from prior research regarding accessibility for individuals with disabilities. Corresponding findings were found in both the quantitative and qualitative data and are categorized into several major themes: environment (indoor and outdoor), surface heights, transportation, dependence, independence, quality of life and participation. Conclusion: Quantitative data from this study indicate that users of MATD are satisfied with the way in which their devices enable maneuvering indoors, while qualitative data suggest otherwise. Implications for healthcare practitioners are described and future recommendations are provided. Implications for Rehabilitation: 1. Healthcare professionals should advocate for proper mobility assistive technology devices (MATDs) for their patients in order to enable increased independence, safety and efficiency. 2. Healthcare professionals must be cognizant of the impact of the environment and/or environmental barriers when prescribing MATD. 3. Additional areas of interest for future research may include investigating the impact of MATD in association with date of onset of disability, according to diagnoses, or specific to length of time since acquiring the device.

AB  - E-books and e-Reading Devices (E-RDs) markets have been enlarged due to the rapid progress of digital technologies. What are the possible factors to increase readers’ willingness to use electronic devices? To improve the predictive value of the original TAM model, this study incorporates three additional constructs to form e-Reading Device Acceptance Mode: reading self-efficacy, computer self-efficacy and perceived enjoyment. This model consists of six constructs and 11 research hypotheses. The research questionnaires were distributed in Taiwan, and the research results showed that reading self-efficacy shows positive influences on readers’ intention to use the E-RDs. On the contrary, computer self-efficacy does not show positive influences on perceived usefulness or perceived enjoyment. Moreover, the perceived ease of use of E-RDs does not show significant impacts on readers’ intention to use the devices. Explanations of the causes and reasons are given in this paper, and the finding of this research may provide useful references and materials for e-book publishers, e-reading device developers, and researchers for further studies.

AB  - The ubiquitous nature of technology today fosters the perception that its use as a means of information sharing and gathering occurs equally across resources. There is however a digital divide which commonly refers to the socio-economic, ethnic, educational, and cultural inequality of access and use of digital technologies in society today. Less clear in the literature is as Digital natives and Immigrants age and enter the workforce, how their age will affect their use of technology as a social and information gathering resource (Herring, 2008). Will advances in mobile technologies and age extend the digital divide or will they continue to be technology zealous? Based on data analyzed from wave 6 of the World Values Survey (WVS) a significant difference exists between the generations in the use of different information sources used for information gathering and sharing as they age.

AB  - One of the emerging issues in media studies is how to develop an integral methodology to understand a digital media phenomenon. Investigational approaches often encounter difficulties in their attempts to address complex contexts surrounding the usage of digital devices. Associated with sociology, traditional media and communication studies tend to understand media phenomena based on quantitative techniques such as a large-scale survey and statistical analysis, whose attempts often fail to grasp the highly personalized features of digital media. We need to accept the limitations of existing methods in investigating a new media phenomenon, and try to find alternative techniques to catch the dimension in which a particular technology acquires meaningful social relations with individuals. In this context, mobile media studies, as one of the most compelling signifiers of digital technology, seem to be able to play an experimental role in the verification of a new methodology. These attempts, in fact, are based on the recent speculation that the usage of mobile phones should not be investigated and described merely depending on a social communicational model. This chapter will introduce a theoretical struggle surrounding the contribution to media studies offered by reflexive ethnographic methods. Particularly, it will propose performance ethnography as a new possible way to describe digital media as a cultural craft, introducing an action research project on mobile media conducted by the author since 2009.

AB  - Background: The study reported in this article focuses on an exploration of the role and nature of play in young children’s use of toys that connect physical and digital domains. Purpose: The purpose of the article is to explore the nature of the connections that are made in play that transverses physical and virtual domains. The article draws on posthuman theory to explain some of the complexity of the play that occurs in these contexts. Research Design: The research took place in the United Kingdom, and the overall study consisted of four distinct stages: (a) A survey of 2,000 parents of children aged 0–5 years, focusing on children’s access to and use of tablet apps; (b) case studies of preschool children’s use of apps in six families; (c) observations of children aged 3–5 years in a school using apps; and (d) content and multimodal analysis of apps. The focus of this article is on (b), although some of the survey data from the first stage of the study are also shared to provide context. Data Collection and Analysis: The focus for this article is the play of a three-year-old girl, Amy. In addition to ethnographic data constructed over a 2-month period (field notes, interviews, photographs, and films), Amy’s mother collected data between the researchers’ visits by making films of her daughter’s use of apps. Amy also collected data herself by wearing a GoPro chestcam. The data that inform the analysis in this article are from a film created by Amy (11:05 minutes) and a video filmed by Amy’s mother (5.21 minutes). Data were both inductively analyzed using multimodal (inter)action analysis and deductively analyzed using a posthumanist approach. Findings: Amy’s play connected digital and nondigital components in complex ways. An app and related physical object that typify the Internet of Toys provided opportunities for Amy’s play to take place across physical and digital domains, and the inorganic objects embedded in the electronic toy and related app were an important element of this play, shaping Amy’s responses at times. However, Amy’s play was not always determined by the design of the electronic objects, and she demonstrated agency within play episodes. There were multiple connections made across a variety of domains/ dimensions, which added to the complexity of the play. Conclusions/Recommendations: Young children’s play increasingly connects digital and nondigital domains, and posthumanist theories can enhance understanding of how connections across these time/spaces are made.

AB  - Aim: The aim of this study was to explore the management of type 1 diabetes in Australian primary schools: kindergarten-Year 2, from the parent’s perspective. The study questions were: What diabetes treatment is being delivered? Who is providing the treatment? Where is the treatment given? Methods: A cross sectional, descriptive approach was used to collect data from parents (66) of children with type 1 diabetes attending an Australian primary school (kindergarten-Year 2). An online self-administered questionnaire was designed in Survey Monkey and was available via a dedicated Facebook page. Data were analysed using statistical analysis (SPSSv21). Results: Blood glucose testing was occurring for all children, with 49% of children self testing. 77% of children were receiving an insulin bolus or injection at school. 34% was provided by the child and 53% of insulin was given via pump. Teachers, parents and teacher’s aides also provided insulin at school. There was a statistically significant association between the number of children receiving insulin at school and the insulin delivery device, χ² = 16.75, df = 1, p ≤ 0.000). Children using insulin pump therapy were more likely (97%) to receive insulin at school than children who used injections (55%). Children who were able to self-administer insulin were more likely to receive insulin (93%) at school than children who were unable to self-administer insulin (65%) (χ² = 7.38, df = 1, p = 0.007) 81% of children received diabetes treatment in the classroom, with the remainder in the school administration office. Conclusion: Insulin administration across Australian primary schools was inconsistent. Not all children were receiving the recommended insulin treatment. Insulin pump therapy appears to increase access to this treatment at school. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The recent appearance of low cost virtual reality (VR) technologies – like the Oculus Rift, the HTC Vive and the Sony PlayStation VR – and Mixed Reality Interfaces (MRITF) – like the Hololens – is attracting the attention of users and researchers suggesting it may be the next largest stepping stone in technological innovation. However, the history of VR technology is longer than it may seem: the concept of VR was formulated in the 1960s and the first commercial VR tools appeared in the late 1980s. For this reason, during the last 20 years, 100s of researchers explored the processes, effects, and applications of this technology producing 1000s of scientific papers. What is the outcome of this significant research work? This paper wants to provide an answer to this question by exploring, using advanced scientometric techniques, the existing research corpus in the field. We collected all the existent articles about VR in the Web of Science Core Collection scientific database, and the resultant dataset contained 21,667 records for VR and 9,944 for augmented reality (AR). The bibliographic record contained various fields, such as author, title, abstract, country, and all the references (needed for the citation analysis). The network and cluster analysis of the literature showed a composite panorama characterized by changes and evolutions over the time. Indeed, whether until 5 years ago, the main publication media on VR concerned both conference proceeding and journals, more recently journals constitute the main medium of communication. Similarly, if at first computer science was the leading research field, nowadays clinical areas have increased, as well as the number of countries involved in VR research. The present work discusses the evolution and changes over the time of the use of VR in the main areas of application with an emphasis on the future expected VR’s capacities, increases and challenges. We conclude considering the disruptive contribution that VR/AR/MRITF will be able to get in scientific fields, as well in human communication and interaction, as already happened with the advent of mobile phones by increasing the use and the development of scientific applications (e.g., in clinical areas) and by modifying the social communication and interaction among people.

AB  - Background/Context: This study draws on the voluminous research on teachers' workplace orientations and especially on Dan Lortie's documentation of conservatism, individualism, and presentism among teachers. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: This study investigated a school reform network of over 300 secondary schools entitled Raising Achievement Transforming Learning (RATL) to explore the role of the network's interventions in increasing or diminishing presentism. Setting: England. Population/Participants/Subjects: Quantitative performance data were analyzed for all 300 schools. Site visits were made to 10 RATL schools in which educational administrators and teachers were interviewed individually and in focus groups. Additional phone interviews were conducted with administrators in 14 RATL schools. Intervention/Program/Practice: RATL provided a combination of interventions and supports for schools in the network, including data analysis and capacity enhancement; partnering mentor schools with low-performing schools; regional conferences; a Web portal for schools in the project; and a menu of short-, medium-, and long-term strategies for change. Research Design: Qualitative interviews and focus groups of educators in RATL schools, along with secondary analysis of pupil performance data. Conclusions/Recommendations: In Dan Lortie's seminal research on teachers’ workplace orientations, he identified 'presentism,' or short-term thinking, with conservatism and individualism. This research indicates that in the RATL project, individualism among teachers diminished, but this did not diminish either conservatism or presentism. The research identifies three kinds of presentism—endemic, adaptive, and addictive—that have amplified educational conservatism while altering its nature to fit the current culture and political economy of fast capitalism.

AB  - One of the most significant and obvious examples of how mobile communication influences our understanding of time and space is how we coordinate with one another. Mobile communication enables us to call specific individuals, not general places. Regardless of location, we are able to make contact with almost anyone, almost anywhere. This advancement has changed, and continues to change, human interaction. Now, instead of agreeing on a particular time well beforehand, we can iteratively work out the most convenient time and place to meet at the last possible moment—on the way to the meeting or once we arrive at the destination. In their early days, mobile devices were primarily used for various types of emergency situations and for work. In some cases, the device was an essential element in various business operations or used so that overseas workers could communicate with their families. The distance between a remote posting and the people back home was suddenly and dramatically reduced. People began to share these devices not necessarily out of economic issues, but also questions of family and interpersonal dynamics. The process of sharing decisions as to who is a legitimate partner makes the nature of relationships more explicit. By examining the economy of sharing, we not only see how sharing mobile phones restructures social space, but are also insight into an individual's web of interactions. This cutting-edge book deals with modern ways of thinking about communication and human interaction; it will illuminate the ways in which mobile communication alters our experience with space and time.

AB  - The increased acquisition of touch-screen technologies, such as tablet computers, in both homes and schools raises important questions about their role for very young children's learning and development. Their inherent touch-based interaction offers new opportunities for mark making practices, which are linked to literacy development, through the emergent process of using marks as symbolic representation. This paper reports a comparative study of touch-based interaction using a tablet computer versus traditional physical paint and paper. Children aged 2–3 years engaged in a free finger painting activity and colouring in activity in both paper and digital environments. Video data of their interactions was used to develop a coding scheme for analyzing touch-based interaction, providing insight into how the use of fingers and hands differed in each environment, the different types and qualities of touch that were engendered, and the composition of the final paintings produced. Findings show that while the tablet computer limited the number of fingers used for interaction, its material affordances supported speed and continuity, which led to more mark making, and different ‘scales’ of mark making extending the range of mark making practices. At the same time it limited the sensory experience of physical paint and resulted in more uniform final compositions. The findings are discussed in terms of shaping young children's mark making, the implications of the use of touch screen technologies in literacy development for educational practitioners and technology design, and key future research directions.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the role of English as Foreign Language (EFL) learners’ metacognitive listening strategies awareness and podcast-use readiness in using podcasting technology for learning English as a foreign language. One hundred and forty-one EFL students completed Metacognitive Awareness Listening Questionnaire (MALQ) that assessed their awareness and perceived use of listening strategies in five components including planning-evaluation, directed attention, person knowledge, mental translation, and problem solving. They also completed a questionnaire that assessed their readiness to use podcasting in terms of familiarity, attitude, and experience. Information on participants’ frequency of podcast use for learning English, frequency of the internet use, and digital device ownership was also obtained. The result of the analysis revealed that podcasting use was significantly related to metacognitive listening strategies awareness in general and its entire components except mental translation strategies while the strongest correlation was found with problem solving strategies (r = .49, p < 0.01). Podcasting use was also found to be significantly related to perceived podcast-use readiness and internet use hours. Further, multiple regressions showed that perceived podcast-use readiness, problem solving, and person knowledge -in order of power prediction- were good predictors of podcasting use for learning English as a foreign language.

AB  - The prevalence of telework and other forms of mobile working enabled by digital technology is increasing markedly. Following a socio-technical systems approach, this study aims to examine the role of organisational social support and specific support for teleworkers in influencing teleworker wellbeing, the mediating role of social isolation, potentially resulting from a person-environment mismatch in these relationships, and possible differences in these relationships between low-intensity and hybrid teleworkers. Teleworkers' (n = 804) perceptions of support and telework outcomes (psychological strain, job satisfaction, and social isolation) were collected using an on-line survey of teleworking employees distributed within 28 New Zealand organisations where knowledge work was undertaken. Organisational social support and teleworker support was associated with increased job satisfaction and reduced psychological strain. Social isolation mediated the relationship between organisational social support and the two outcome variables, and some differences were observed in the structural relationships for hybrid and low-intensity teleworker sub-samples. These findings suggest that providing the necessary organisational and teleworker support is important for enhancing the teleworker-environment fit and thereby ensuring desirable telework outcomes.

AB  - Telecommunication offers a cost-saving alternative to face-to-face vocational rehabilitation (VR) service delivery, yet little is known about the current use. This article describes findings from an exploratory survey of 1,187 counselors, representing 13 VR agencies across the United States. The online survey explored agency, counselor, and client facilitators and barriers to telecommunication use during the VR process. Staff with training in telecommunication strategies reported significantly higher rates of email telecommunication (p < .01). Counselors with a higher rural caseload mix engaged in significantly less email telecommunication during the VR process, and rural clients as compared with urban clients were characterized as having less personal access to a computer with Internet. Although counselors use and rely on simple telecommunication methods such as phone and email to serve their clients, strategies to address barriers are needed to expand telecommunication use during the VR process.

AB  - This longitudinal study explores the effects of tracking and monitoring time devoted to learn with a mobile tool, on self-regulated learning. Graduate students (n = 36) from three different online courses used their own mobile devices to track how much time they devoted to learn over a period of four months. Repeated measures of the Online Self-Regulated Learning Questionnaire and Validity and Reliability of Time Management Questionnaire were taken along the course. Our findings reveal positive effects of tracking time on time management skills. Variations in the channel, content and timing of the mobile notifications to foster reflective practice are investigated, and time-logging patterns are described. These results not only provide evidence of the benefits of recording learning time, but also suggest relevant cues on how mobile notifications should be designed and prompted towards self-regulated learning of students in online courses.

AB  - Research problem: When dealing with procedural documents, individuals sometimes encounter comprehension problems due to poor information design. Researchers studying the use and understanding of procedural documents, as well as technical writers charged with the design of these documents, or usability specialists evaluating their quality, would all benefit from tools allowing them to collect real-time data concerning user behavior in user-centered studies. With this in mind, the generic software Technical Instructions Processing—Evaluations and experiments Editor (TIP-EXE) was designed to facilitate the carrying out of such studies. Research questions: Does document design, and specifically the matching or mismatching of the terms employed in a user manual and on the corresponding device, affect the cognitive processes involved in the comprehension of procedural instructions? Can we use a software tool like TIP-EXE to assess the impact of document design on the use and understanding of a procedural document? Literature review: A review of the methods employed to study either the use of procedural documents or their cognitive processing, and to evaluate the quality of these documents, revealed the lack of tools for collecting relevant data. Methodology: TIP-EXE software was used to set up and run a laboratory experiment designed to collect data concerning the effect of document design on the performance of a task. The experiment was conducted with 36 participants carrying out tasks involving the programming of a digital timer under one of three conditions: 'matching instructions,' 'mismatching instructions,''mismatching instructions + picture'. Based on a click-and-read method for blurred text, TIP-EXE was used to collect data on the time the users spent reading the instructions, as well as the time spent handling the timer. Results and discussion: Results show that 'matching instructions' (when the terms employed in the user manual match the terms on the device) enhance user performance. This instructional format results in less time spent consulting the instructions and handling the device, as well as fewer errors. This research shows that TIP-EXE software can be used to study the way in which operating instructions are read, and the time spent consulting specific information contained therein, thereby revealing the effects of document design on user behavior.

AB  - Success in web services cannot promise the success in corresponding mobile services. To understand the mobile service adoption behavior under the context of web–mobile service transition, this study, taking mobile eWOM services as an example, investigates the role of trust in mobile service adoption and empirically examines the trust transfer mechanism. Specifically, trust in web services and two relationship-relevant factors namely functional consistency and perceived entitativity are proposed as the predictors of trust in mobile services. A field survey with 235 mobile eWOM services users is conducted to test the research model and hypotheses. The key findings include (1) trust in mobile services positively influences intention to use mobile services; (2) trust in web services, functional consistency and perceived entitativity positively influence trust in mobile services; (3) functional consistency positively influences perceived entitativity. Limitations, theoretical and practical implications are also discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - A concurrent mixed methods design was used to explore personal and workplace factors, informed by the Theory of Planned Behavior, that affect truck drivers’ decision-making about distracted driving on the job. Qualitative data were collected via semi-structured interviews with experts in truck safety and distracted driving, and quantitative data were collected via online survey of truck drivers in the United States. Findings from the interviews illustrated how drivers perceived distractions and the importance of supervisors enforcing organizational distracted driving policies. Survey results found that behavioral intentions were most important in regards to texting and crash and near-crash outcomes, while perceived norms from management best described the correlation between dispatch device use and negative crash-related outcomes. By using a mixed methods design, rather than two separate studies, these findings revealed nuanced differences into the influence of supervisors on distracted driving.

AB  - This study examined the factors affecting university students' resistance and intention to use of mobile learning by developing an integrated research model that combines innovation diffusion theory (IDT) and model of innovation resistance (MIR). We added the concepts of inertia and innovativeness to shed light on the personal aspects of students' adoption of mobile learning. Data were collected from a self–administered online survey of South Korean university students (N = 493). Structural equation results revealed that relative advantage, complexity, and inertia had significant effects on students' mobile learning resistance, with inertia being the most significant. Relative advantage, innovativeness, and mobile learning resistance had significant effects on students’ intention to use mobile learning, with relative advantage being the most significant. Furthermore, mobile learning resistance was found to mediate the effects of relative advantage and complexity on intention to use mobile learning. The results provide valuable implications for researchers and educational practitioners to develop and implement appropriate strategies for mobile learning.

AB  - The research proposes a framework incorporating the flow theory and the theory of planned behaviour to understand the intention of subscribers to expand their use of mobile videophones. The research model was tested with the partial least square graph software based on its structural equation modelling approach. The data used in this research were collected from online questionnaires done by 151 respondents. The findings show that the flow and the subjective norm are positively related to the expanded intention to use mobile videophones and the privacy concern is negatively related to that intention. The results also reveal that the effects of media characteristics such as interactivity and telepresence may have significant influences on the flow. Moreover, the effects of the flow, the subjective norm and the privacy concern are moderated by self-monitoring. Regardless of personality, people are likely to expand the intention to use mobile videophones when they immerse themselves in the flow. Several implications for research and practice are derived from these findings. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Pregnancy is a very special time in a woman's life, a time of physical and psychological change. Often anxiety and negative emotions prevent to fully enjoy this magical moment and hamper the well-being, negatively influence obstetric outcomes, development of the child and neonatal adaptation. BenEssere Mamma aims to improve pregnant wellbeing, helping women to be conscious of their affective state and to learn strategies to better cope with anxiety and stress. BenEssere Mamma consists of a brief self-help protocol containing inspired mindfulness meditation and guided imagery exercises for a total of four weeks. This study reports a brief user experience (Beta Version) among pregnant women, delivered by mobile devices. Twelve mothers-to-be experienced a 7-days study and filled two online ad hoc questionnaires. The application was perceived easy to use. Exercises were assessed as pleasant and quite effective.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to propose user experience sharing (UES) as a customer-based initiation of value co-creation pertaining to service provision, which represents customers’ level of effort made for the direct benefit of others in their service network. The authors propose and empirically examine a user experience sharing model (UESM) that explicates customer-to-customer (C2C) UES and its impacts on firm-desired customer-based outcomes in online communities. Design/methodology/Approach: Based on an extensive review, the authors conceptualize UES and UESM. By using online survey data collected from mobile app users in organic online communities, the authors performed structural equation modeling analyses by using AMOS 24. Findings: The results support the proposed UESM, showing that C2C UES acts as a key driver of both firm-desired customer efforts and customer insights. The results also confirmed that service-dominant (S-D) logic-informed motivational drivers exert a significant impact on C2C UES. Importantly, C2C UES mediates the relationship between S-D logic-informed motivational drivers and firm-desired customer-based outcomes. Originality/value: This study offers a pioneering attempt to develop an overarching concept, UES, which reflects customers’ initiation of value co-creation, and to empirically examine C2C UES. The empirical evidence supports the key contention that firms should proactively facilitate C2C UES. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Problem: Reflecting on workplace-based experiences is necessary for professional development. However, residents need support to raise their awareness of valuable moments for learning and to thoughtfully analyze those learning moments afterwards. Approach: From October to December 2012, the authors held a multidisciplinary six-week postgraduate training module focused on general competencies. Residents were randomly assigned to one of four conditions with varying degrees of reflection support; they were offered (1) a smartphone app, (2) coaching group sessions, (3) a combination of both, or (4) neither type of support. The app allowed participants to capture in real time learning moments as a text note, audio recording, picture, or video. Coaching sessions held every two weeks aimed to deepen participants’ reflection on captured learning moments. Questionnaire responses and reflection data were compared between conditions to assess the effects of the app and coaching sessions on intensity and frequency of reflection. Outcomes: Sixty-four residents participated. App users reflected more often, captured more learning moments, and reported greater learning progress than nonapp users. Participants who attended coaching sessions were more alert to learning moments and pursued more follow-up learning activities to improve on the general competencies. Those who received both types of support were most alert to these learning moments. Next Steps: A simple mobile app for capturing learning moments shows promise as a tool to support workplace-based learning, especially when combined with coaching sessions. Future research should evaluate these tools on a broader scale and in conjunction with residents’ and students’ personal digital portfolios.

AB  - Aims and objectives: The aims were to explore advanced practice nurses' perceptions on wireless Personal Digital Assistant technologies, to establish the type and range of tools that would be useful to support their practice and to identify any requirements and limitations that may impact the implementation of wireless Personal Digital Assistants in practice. Background: The wireless Personal Digital Assistant is becoming established as a hand-held computing tool for healthcare professionals. The reflections of advanced practice nurses' about the value of wireless Personal Digital Assistants and its potential to contribute to improved patient care has not been investigated. Design: A qualitative interpretivist design was used to explore advanced practice nurses' perceptions on the value of wireless Personal Digital Assistant technologies to support their practice. Methods: The data were collected using survey questionnaires and individual and focus group interviews with nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists and information technology managers based in British Columbia, Canada. An open-coding content analysis was performed using qualitative data analysis software. Results: Wireless Personal Digital Assistant's use supports the principles of pervasivity and is a technology rapidly being adopted by advanced practice nurses. Some nurses indicated a reluctance to integrate wireless Personal Digital Assistant technologies into their practices because of the cost and the short technological life cycle of these devices. Many of the barriers which precluded the use of wireless networks within facilities are being removed. Nurses demonstrated a complex understanding of wireless Personal Digital Assistant technologies and gave good rationales for its integration in their practice. Conclusions: Nurses identified improved client care as the major benefit of this technology in practice and the type and range of tools they identified included clinical reference tools such as drug and diagnostic/laboratory reference applications and wireless communications. Relevance to clinical practice: Nurses in this study support integrating wireless mobile computing technologies into their practice to improve client care.

AB  - Chronic stress in young adults has become a growing problem within recent decades and many are unable to find cost-effective and accessible treatment for psychological stress in their daily lives. We analyze the market of using a mobile application, Positive Technology, as a solution. Eleven participants, aged between 18 and 24, participated in the exercise. Self-reported stress reduction was measured via an online marketing survey, while physiological measurements were monitored via peripheral devices. Secondary goals assessed the app’s ease-of-use, accessibility, and cost. Results indicate that participants enjoyed the availability of the mobile solution and found the app to be fun and easy to learn. Stress levels were reduced in 73% of the participants, with higher effects in females and in participants aged 18-24. We conclude that the mobile platform is an effective means of delivering psychological stress reduction, and could provide an accessible, cost-effective solution.

AB  - This paper examines recent acclaim for professional embedded photojournalists who visually document the experience of US soldiers in Afghanistan using the popular mobile photo application Hipstamatic. These photos have stirred controversy among fellow journalists and cultural critics regarding the use of photo filters in Hipstamatic and similar app Instagram, their contribution to the de-professionalization of photojournalism, and the depiction of war as stylishly vintage. The debates about Hipstamatic and Instagram in war photography open up a whole series of enduring questions about distinctions between photography and illustration, photography and photojournalism, professional and amateur, and reporting and editorializing. In consideration of the shifting nature of digital photography, photojournalism, and specifically war photojournalism, I argue that this discourse about the use of mobile apps overlooks another important ethical issue: the implications of non-soldiers mimicking the imagined hand of the modern smartphone-equipped US soldier, particularly in light of soldiers’ own complex media-making practices.

AB  - Aim: To evaluate nurses' satisfaction with, and perceptions of, a practice innovation introducing a Mobile Admission Nurse service. Background: Staff nurses identified that the admission process, while crucial to initiating safe and appropriate acute care, can be disruptive and interfere with care in progress. A pilot project implementing the role of a Mobile Admission Nurse was introduced to address this need. Method: A self-developed web-based survey was administered to a convenience sample of 104 RNs who had used the services during the pilot project. Results: Staff nurses (n = 78) reported a chaotic, demanding work environment within which the admission process disrupts the flow of care. The Mobile Admission Nurse helped them in 'weathering the storm', which was the overarching theme that emerged during data analysis. Conclusions: Having an admission nurse complete the admission process steadied workflow processes for nurses. Improved patient safety and increased staff and family satisfaction were also reported. The strongly positive feedback led to expansion of the service. Implications for nursing management: Proactively redesigning work processes, using a structured theoretical model such as the (Plan–Do–Study–Act) PDSA approach, may improve outcomes in a chaotic practice environment.

AB  - This is an ongoing research project, which has developed an 'Instant Questioning-Answering (iQA) system.' With the iQA system, it is expected that when learners have any questions about learning contents and cannot ask teachers or well-performing peers face to face, they can use their mobile smart devices to ask questions online via browsers or Apps and immediately obtain different levels of feedback to assist their learning. The iQAsystem allows teachers to launch several chat rooms and Answering Robots at the same time. To improve the operational effectiveness of the iQA system and make the Answering Robot provide answer feedback more precisely to those learners who raise questions, the contents of the QA database are constantly enhanced. The effectiveness of Chinese word segmentation also plays an important role. Currently, a new Chinese word segmentation system embedded in the iQA system has been developed to improve the effectiveness of Chinese word segmentation.

AB  - Objective: To review published reports on Web-based treatment and prevention programs for depression, anxiety, and suicide prevention in children, adolescents, and emerging adults. Method: A systematic search of the PsycINFO, PubMed, Medline, and Web of Science databases was conducted in December 2013. Programs were classified according to evidence-base level (Well-Established, Probably Efficacious, Possibly Efficacious, Experimental, and Of Questionable Efficacy). Results: Of the 14,001 citations initially identified, 25 articles met inclusion criteria for Web-based interventions. These described 9 programs, of which 8 were Internet based and 1 was a mobile application. No Web-based interventions for suicide prevention were identified. Of the randomized controlled trials (n = 14) and open trials (n = 3) identified, 10 reported significant postintervention reductions in symptoms of depression and/or anxiety or improvements in diagnostic ratings, with small to large effect sizes. Many of these studies also reported significant improvements at follow-up. The methodological quality of the studies varied. Many programs were limited by their small sample sizes and use of waitlist or no-treatment control groups. Conclusion: There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of Web-based interventions for youth depression and anxiety. Additional research and program development are needed to fill the current gaps in the literature. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Large individual differences characterize maternal postpartum sleep and adjustment. Our goal was to explore aspects of mothers’ nocturnal environments and behaviours that may explain differences in postpartum adjustment. A total of 201 mothers of infants aged 0–6 months completed an online survey with demographics, number and duration of nocturnal awakenings, caretaking behaviours, environment and nocturnal activities during ‘one typical night during the past week’. Mothers reported 2.9 [standard deviation (SD) ± 1.7] nocturnal awakenings, each lasting 33.9 (SD ± 22.5) min. Infant age was related inversely to duration but unrelated to number of awakenings. Falling asleep while feeding was less frequent among exclusively formula‐feeders. Among the entire sample, mothers used a cellphone (59%), backlit tablet (25%), TV (20%) and computer (16%) during nocturnal awakenings. Watching TV and using a computer were each associated with longer nocturnal awakenings. Eighty‐nine per cent of women used ≥ 1 extra light source during nocturnal awakenings: night light (35%), light from a cracked door (28%), desk lamp (25%), electronic device (19%) or room light (14%). Light source(s) was unrelated to number or duration of nocturnal awakenings. These data suggest that, although supplemental light sources were not associated with awakenings, TV and computer use accounted for longer awakenings. Feeding method and technology use may help to explain individual differences in postpartum adjustments and may be targets for more effective interventions.

AB  - The goal of this study is to gain a detailed understanding of the experience of instructors who have been using Tablet PCs (TPCs) for their teaching practice. The study examines the lived experience of 28 faculty members from a College of Engineering which is promoting the diffusion of TPCs in the classroom. Phenomenology was adopted to answer the question 'What is it like to use a TPC to teach a course?' Written applications, one-on-one interviews, classroom observations, and an online discussion board are the data sources. From the iterative process of qualitative data analysis, four common themes emerged in terms of converting to digital resources, teaching by handwriting on the screen, becoming comfortable with technology, and human enjoyment of using the TPC.

AB  - This study focuses on second screening for news, a hybrid media process that combines watching news on television and a second, web‐connected screen (i.e., smart‐phone, laptop). Based on U.S.‐national, 2‐wave panel data, the paper (a) examines people's motivations to engage in second screen use, and then (b) advances the relationship between second screening and online political behaviors. Discussing and pursuing further information are both central motivations for second screen use. Furthermore, results suggest second screening for news is a significant predictor of online political participation and a key link between TV news and political engagement as this relationship is fully mediated. The study advances theoretically and empirically ways in which an informed public opinion may partake of a more engaged democracy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Since early in the development of children’s television, research has informed policy and practice involving young children’s media use. To increase the likelihood that new media support children’s development, research in the coming decade must stay current with advancing technology. With the advent of various forms of interactive digital media, key research questions involve social and physical interactivity. How should adults appropriately support children’s use of different kinds of media to promote children’s creativity, learning, and development? How does co-viewing (social interaction) overlap with and differ from contingency built into the medium itself? When a device interacts, does that change the kind of support required of a co-viewing adult, or eliminate the need for such support? How does the introduction of new technology impact the lives of families? Issues related to video chat, touchscreen and motion capture technology, artificial intelligence, and electronic books and games are discussed.

AB  - Nearly 6000 adults from 7 countries participated in an online survey about what other activities they engaged in while taking the survey and how distracted they felt. Younger people were more likely than older ones to engage in electronic and non-electronic multitasking. Engaging in a wider range of tasks was associated with feeling more distracted. However, once the variety of tasks was taken into account, interruptions associated with checking or talking on one’s phone made participants feel less distracted. The relationship between age, multitasking, and feeling distraction was curvilinear, with middle-aged respondents being more affected by multitasking than either younger or older survey takers. The findings suggest that people of all ages are often deliberate multitaskers who choose their distractions intentionally, at least some of the time. This bodes well for researchers seeking to administer online surveys, because it suggests that survey takers will set themselves up with the type and amount of distractions they are comfortable with. The finding that a high degree of electronic multitasking may decrease the perception of distraction should be followed by experiments verifying if this perception corresponds to actual task performance.

AB  - Background: In the past decade, the range of contraceptives available has increased dramatically. There are limited data on the factors that determine women's choices on contraceptive alternatives or what factors providers consider most important when recommending contraceptive products to women. Objectives: Our objectives were to compare women's (consumers') preferences and GPs' (providers') views in relation to existing and new contraceptive methods, and particularly to examine what factors increase the acceptability of different contraceptive products. Methods: A best-worst attribute stated-choice experiment was completed online. Participants (Australian women of reproductive age and Australian GPs) completed questions on 16 contraceptive profiles. 200 women of reproductive age were recruited through a commercial panel. GPs from all states of Australia were randomly sampled and approached by phone; 162 GPs agreed to participate. Participants chose the best and worst attribute levels of hypothetical but realistic prescribed contraceptive products. Best and worst choices were modelled using multinomial logit and product features were ranked from best to worst according to the size of model coefficients. Results: The most attractive feature of the contraceptive products for both GPs and women consumers were an administration frequency of longer than 1 year and light or no bleeding. Women indicated that the hormonal vaginal ring was the least attractive mode of administration. Conclusions: Women and GPs agree that longer-acting methods with less bleeding are important features in preferred methods of contraception; however, women are also attracted to products involving less invasive modes of administration. While the vaginal ring may fill the niche in Australia for a relatively non-invasive, moderately long-acting and effective contraceptive, the results of this study indicate that GPs will need to promote the benefits of the vaginal ring to overcome negative perceptions about this method among women who may benefit from using it.

AB  - The present study sheds light on the nature of the multi-dimensional aspects of news consumption by focusing on three different news-related activities on online social networking services (SNSs): news reading, news posting, and news endorsing. Borrowing from the literature on uses and gratifications theory, as well as media attendance theory and the concept of a technology cluster, the study investigated why people consume news differently on SNSs. The results show that each type of news activity may derive from different kinds of motivations, media habits and technology clusters. For example, the motivation of 'getting recognition' was found to be an important driving force for news posting, while it was not a significant predictor of news reading and news endorsing. On the other hand, the 'entertainment' motivation was revealed to be positively associated with news reading and news endorsing, while it was not with news posting. In addition, those who have an internet-based news repertoire were more likely to participate in news activities on SNSs and those who have many mobile devices were found to participate in news reading more frequently. The study was conducted using a national online survey. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Few studies of employed people who use wheelchairs, canes, crutches or walkers have been reported in the literature. One reason for this paucity of research reports is that surveys are most often made of unemployed individuals with disabilities a defined broadly. Understanding the work site of successfully employed people who use mobility devices requires the development of as survey that can be used to examine the important features of worksite from employees who use mobility devices at their worksites. Objective: This article describes the development and psychometrics of a survey on currently employed people with lower limb impairments and mobility limitations who use mobility devices. The items in the Mobility Device User Work Survey (MWS) were based on interviews and survey items pilot tested on employed mobility device users. Participants: A sample of 183 employed people who use mobility devices including wheelchairs, canes, crutches or walkers was recruited using internet postings on disability-related organization web sites. The average age of the sample was 46.3, most were college educated, 72% used wheelchairs and the average number of years of employment was 24. Methods: The MWS was completed by 183 people who met the inclusion criteria. The survey was sent to these same people a second time and 132 of them returned the second survey. Results: The MWS consists of 106 questions on demographic, work and worksite characteristics and 58 subjective evaluation items that were organized into five scales. The internal consistencies (Cronbach’s alpha) of the five scales were moderate (0.72) to good (0.93). Stability values of the five scales were calculated using correlations between forms and ranged from 0.70 to 0.80. The evaluative scales were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis. Conclusions: The MWS provides a tool for studying the variables that influence employed people who use mobility devices. Future studies of unemployed people who use mobility devices may benefit from using the results of the MWS to plan interventions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The practice of reading is rapidly moving from print to screen. Young children are not immune from this trend; indeed, many children's principal literacy experiences occur using iPads and other handheld digital devices. This transition raises important questions about how the emergence and development of literacy might change in these new environments. This paper reviews research to date on e-reading, both in the pre-tablet and tablet era, within the context of what we know more generally about literacy development. We then propose topics for future research and discuss methodological issues related to the investigation of these topics. Our goal is to spark further discussion about how to study young children's literacy development in the emerging e-reading era. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)
