AB  - Background: Feelings of loss, shame and stigmatization, reduced quality of life, isolation and loneliness are common among men and women with infertility. Fertility patients may seek peer mentoring and support, specifically through the use of online forums, to fulfil their needs for shared experience and guidance through the fertility treatment process. Objective: To assess the use and benefits of an online fertility-related peer support forum through two research questions: (1) do socio-demographics, stress, and anxiety differ between posters on the forum, lurkers who read messages but did not post, and people who chose not to use it?; and (2) how did forum users describe their experiences? Design: A sample of 220 male and female fertility patients aged 23–54 years old (M = 35.51, SD = 4.94) were recruited at fertility clinics in Montreal and Toronto, Canada, to test a mobile application called ‘Infotility’. They answered questionnaires before and after being given access to Infotility for eight weeks. The peer support forum was accessible through the Infotility dashboard. Main Outcome Measures: Psychological distress was measured through the 4-item Perceived Stress Scale and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item Scale. Experiences using the forum were assessed through open-ended questions and in-depth interviews. Results: Participants with heightened psychological distress were more likely to become posters rather than lurkers or non-users and reported less distress after using the forum. Forum users appreciated the opportunity to share their experiences with others in similar situations. Conclusion: The forum reduced loneliness and allowed participants to learn new ways to manage stress. It was particularly beneficial for those with heightened psychological distress.

AB  - The rise in the network society might lead to a decline in face-to-face contact as people substitute it with more mediated forms, or an increase in both face-to-face and mediated contact as complements, with unknown consequences for social support. This article examines trends in social contact, mediated contact (phone, online, etc.), and social support in 2002, 2006 and 2010, using aggregated ABS General Social Survey data. Results show an aggregate decline in face-to-face contact and rise in mediated contact in Australia between 2002 and 2010, but no aggregate decline in perceived social support, and a strong positive individual-level association between both forms of contact and social support. There are, however, signs of an emerging class-based digital divide, with low-income older men and less educated respondents reporting lower levels of mediated contact and social support by 2010.

AB  - Abstract: Using a qualitative research approach, this study examines the appropriation of digital technologies and their implications for the reception of the so-called ‘pirate’ radio in Zimbabwe. It specifically explores how the use of the Internet (and its associated digital technologies), including the mobile phone by two prominent ‘underground’ radio stations, Short Wave (SW) Radio Africa and Voice of America’s Studio 7, beaming into Zimbabwe from the UK and the US, respectively, has impacted on the reception of their content. Drawing on reception theory, the paper highlights the ambiguities and complexities associated with the reception of (pirate) radio in the era of convergence in Africa. It argues that while both SW Radio Africa and Studio 7’s multiple digital transmission strategies have broadened the range of options available for the reception of their content (albeit in disproportionate ways), traditional forms of reception remain in force. This is largely because of enduring questions of access to digital technologies (especially the Internet), and the lasting connections between traditional live radio and the oral traditions of local culture. These contextual factors sustain reception practices that differ markedly from the scenario in the economically developed world of the North where digital technologies have radically redefined radio reception practices. Similarly, the mobile phone has expanded options for the generation and reception of news content from the radio stations thus pointing to the fact that in Africa convergence can indeed assume unique forms, shaped by an intricate combination of local socio-economic and cultural factors.

AB  - Background: The advent of Internet-based self-help systems for common mental disorders has generated a need for quick ways to triage would-be users to systems appropriate for their disorders. This need can be met by using brief online screening questionnaires, which can also be quickly used to screen patients prior to consultation with a GP. Objective: To test and enhance the validity of the Web Screening Questionnaire (WSQ) to screen for: depressive disorder, alcohol abuse/dependence, GAD, PTSD, social phobia, panic disorder, agoraphobia, specific phobia, and OCD. Methods: A total of 502 subjects (aged 18-80) answered the WSQ and 9 other questionnaires on the Internet. Of these 502, 157 were assessed for DSM-IV-disorders by phone in a WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview with a CIDI-trained interviewer. Results: Positive WSQ 'diagnosis' had significantly (P < .001) higher means on the corresponding validating questionnaire than negative WSQ 'diagnosis'. WSQ sensitivity was 0.72-1.00 and specificity was 0.44-0.77 after replacing three items (GAD, OCD, and panic) and adding one question for specific phobia. The Areas Under the Curve (AUCs) of the WSQ’s items with scaled responses were comparable to AUCs of longer questionnaires. Conclusions: The WSQ screens appropriately for common mental disorders. While the WSQ screens out negatives well, it also yields a high number of false positives. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study aimed to explore what factors influence mobile media users' adoption of new services and whether the adoption models differ depending on users' motives to use mobile media. The decomposed Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) and uses and gratifications theory were used as theoretical frameworks. Methodologically, an online survey was conducted with 400 Korean mobile users and structural equation modelling was employed. As a result, the proposed model explained well users' adoption intention for new mobile services. Especially, high- and low-motive groups showed significant differences in terms of the influence of subjective norms and Perceived Behavioural Control (PBC). [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Introduction: The purpose of this investigation was to compare the results of a web-based and a telephone interview survey measuring driver concerns about a variety of traffic safety issues, their beliefs, and specific driving behaviors. Method: State-wide, annual random digit-dial telephone surveys and web-based surveys were conducted in Maryland. A total of 1,700 drivers were surveyed by telephone and 6,806 took a web survey. Results: Telephone respondents were more likely to be female and older. Web respondents were more likely to be white and not Latino/Hispanic. After controlling for demographic differences, telephone survey respondents were more likely to be concerned about traffic safety. They were more likely to believe that sobriety checkpoints reduce drunk driving (OR=2.18, 95% CI 1.94, 2.45), they would be ticketed for not wearing a seat belt (OR=1.26, 95% CI 1.12, 1.43), and they would be stopped by the police if they drove after drinking too much (OR=1.17, 95% CI 1.03, 1.32). They were less likely to report a variety of risky behaviors including using a cell phone while driving (OR=.54, 95% CI .48, .61) and driving 10+ mph over the speed limit (OR=.81, 95% CI .72, .91), but were more likely to report having been ticketed for a moving violation in the last month (OR=2.22, 95% CI 1.70, 2.90). Suggestions are offered for overcoming potential sources of sampling bias. Impact on Industry: Web-based surveys produce substantially different results than random-digit-dial telephone surveys, when used for public assessments of traffic safety concerns and behaviors.

AB  - The early twenty-first century has seen dramatic changes in the survey climate and landscape. Advances in technology along with changes in coverage for different survey modes have led to an environment where many surveys are now being conducted in whole or in part via self-administered web questionnaires. Traditional pretesting methodologies that do not assess the technology used by the survey itself may miss important quality concerns these newer modes introduce (mode effects). And while traditional pretesting methods have provided great insight into the errors to be addressed in surveys prior to fielding, they can be costly, time consuming, and limited in the range of perspectives gained. This chapter introduces emerging survey pretesting methodologies and compares these with traditional methods to consider whether these methods can be combined to improve today's web and mobile survey needs. It begins by reviewing traditional pretesting methods such as expert review, cognitive interviewing, and pilot testing. Next, the chapter introduces emerging pretesting methods including usability testing, eye tracking, and online pretesting. It concludes with a discussion of the optimal combination of traditional and newer methods for pretesting modern web surveys. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The under-reporting of public safety incidents is a long-standing issue. In this paper, we propose a computational cognitive modeling approach to understand and design a mobile crowdsourcing system for improving campus safety reporting. In particular, we adopt drift-diffusion models (DDMs) from cognitive psychology to investigate the effect of various factors on users’ reporting tendency for public safety. Our lab experiment and online study show consistent results on how location context impacts people's reporting decisions. This finding informs the design of a novel location-based nudge mechanism, which is tested in another lab experiment with 84 participants and proved to be effective in changing users’ reporting decisions. Our follow-up interview study further suggests that the influence of people's mobility patterns (e.g., expected walking distance) could explain why the nudge design is effective. Our work not only informs the design of mobile crowdsourcing for public safety reporting but also demonstrates the value of applying a computational cognitive modeling approach to address HCI research questions more broadly.

AB  - This study critically compares offline focus groups, online focus groups and email discussions with respect to their depth, breadth, efficiency, group dynamics, non-verbal impressions and respondent attitudes. In addition, we add an important element to the email discussion—a feedback loop (e-Delphi)—that can strengthen this form of qualitative research. Discussions in an online focus group take place in a virtual discussion room, where all respondents can view and react to the comments of the moderator and their fellow participants. All respondents are online at the same time, which allows for direct interactions and a synchronous group discussion. The moderator, similar to those in traditional focus groups, plays an important role by leading discussions, asking questions, clarifying ambiguities, summarizing the discussion and ensuring that all important aspects of the research question are discussed. Special online focus group software gives the researcher plenty of opportunities to guide the group discussion. Respondents do not need any special software—a computer and internet connection are sufficient. The central research question for all three methods involves examining the expectations and attitudes of the target groups with respect to mobile phones and mobile internet via general packet radio service (GPRS). All three methods include two different types of respondent, recruited from an existing internet panel according to demographic requirements, The results from our study show that online and offline focus groups and e-Delphi methods differ greatly in terms of their results. All three have their own unique characteristics that influence their degree of suitability for handling specific research situations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Many ophthalmic lens manufacturers are currently marketing blue-blocking filters, which they claim will reduce symptoms of Digital Eye Strain (DES). However, there is limited evidence to support the proposal that DES results from the blue light emitted by electronic screens. Objective: This investigation compared the effect of blue-blocking filters on DES symptoms with a no-filter lens, using a double-blind methodology. METHODS: Twenty-four subjects were required to perform a 20-minute reading task from a tablet computer. They wore either lenses containing a blue-blocking filter (TheraBlue 1.67 or TheraBlue polycarbonate) or a CR-39 control lens which did not include a filter. Immediately following each session, subjects completed a questionnaire to quantify symptoms of DES. Results: While a significant increase in symptoms was observed immediately following the near vision task (p = 0.00001), no significant difference in symptoms was found between the 3 lens conditions (p = 0.74). Conclusions: There is little evidence at this time to support the use of blue-blocking filters as a clinical treatment for DES. Management of other ocular factors, as well as the creation of an optimal environment for screen viewing, are more likely to provide greater success in minimizing symptoms.

AB  - The quality of online information is highly variable because anyone can post data on the internet, and not all online sources are equally reliable, valuable, or accurate. Previous studies reveal problems with online information evaluation skills and a lack of ability in using evaluation criteria, including currency, relevance, authority, accuracy and purpose. The primary purpose of this study is to develop a framework for cooperative and interactive mobile learning to improve students' online information evaluation skills. A mobile learning application is subsequently developed based on the proposed framework. To assess the effectiveness of the developed application, an experiment is conducted on diploma students in a university. A usability questionnaire is conducted on an experimental group to identify students' perceptions regarding the usability of the developed mobile application. The experimental results indicate that the application is significantly more effective with an effect size of 1.91 in improving students’ online information evaluation skills than traditional learning. The results contribute to the extant literature in the context of mobile learning by identifying usability evaluation features and providing a framework for developing cooperative and interactive mobile learning. The implications of the present findings for research and instructional practice are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Based on four-wave panel data, this study explored the relationships between different uses of motivational mobile applications and online news engagement. Three motivational mobile application uses - informational, recreational, and relational - were identified and rank-ordered according to respondents' everyday mobile application preferences. Results showed that only relational mobile application use had positive relationships with online news engagement. Results further indicate that over the four-year period examined (2013-2016) only the use of relational mobile application led to continuous growth of online news engagement. This study advances the literature on mobile communication not only by introducing results of a longitudinal study that challenge and support conflicting previous findings but that also provide support for the possibility of the mobile facilitation hypothesis.

AB  - This exploratory research investigates factors affecting online and offline service quality with respect to a sharing economy driven car-hailing commerce. It further validates the relationships between service quality, satisfaction, and loyalty in the sharing economy driven business context. Building on relevant literature and 71 qualitative interviews, we identified information congruity, competence, and empathy as key factors in online service quality. Offline service quality factors include structural assurance and platform responsiveness. These five factors were included in a model for user loyalty investigation, which was tested on data from 294 questionnaires from Chinese mobile car-hailing service users. Attitudes towards the sharing economy were validated to moderate the relationship between service quality and loyalty. This study contributes to the theoretical development of service quality management, specifically in the context of emerging sharing economy driven car-hailing mobile markets.

AB  - Despite rapid technological development, very few new technology-assisted tools have been developed specifically for use in family services. This article describes a new, mobile-assisted working model designed to enhance the quality of daily family life. The model has its origins in the existing research on daily family life and on the diary method, which has been widely used in data collection in family research. The model provides support for the daily life of client families in the intervals between meetings with family counselors via the use of text messages. The pilot study explored family members’ and family counselors’ experiences of using the model. Data on 26 parents and four children participating in the new mobile-based service were collected via feedback text messages and web questionnaires. The research findings are also based on interviews with family counselors (n = 6). Although clients’ experiences of the model varied widely, the results show that, in general, it was regarded as effective in invoking reflection, keeping the goals of family counseling in mind and implementing family practices at home. On the basis of the experiences of the family counselors, the mobile-based working model offers a new, systematic, and structured tool for use in working with families and monitoring processes in families.

AB  - Purpose: Although mobile devices are ubiquitous among employees, their awareness and readiness to use mobile technologies for competence development is still not widespread and therefore requires further exploration. The purpose of this study is to propose a conceptual model based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) to explain the determinants that affect employees’ intention to use mobile devices and software for knowledge transfer during the process of knowledge management. Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual model based on the UTAUT with new variables concerning relative usability (RU) and user autonomy (UA) and new connections between the determinants was developed as a result of a subject matter literature review. A structural equation modelling approach was used to validate the model on the basis of data collected via a survey collected from 371 employees from 21 sectors, both public and private. Findings: The UTAUT model extended by new variables like RU and UA explains employee acceptance of mobile technologies for knowledge transfer reasonably well. New proposed variables highlighted that the usability of technology compared to other solutions and user autonomy in the selection and the use of applications have the strongest impact on the employees’ intention to use mobile devices and software for knowledge transfer. Research limitations/implications: This model explains the 55 per cent behavioral intention of employees to use mobile technologies for knowledge transfer. Even though it is quite high in terms of acceptance theories, some new variables should be explored. Furthermore, study does not verify whether m-learning acceptance for knowledge transfer is sector-specific. Practical implications: Mobile technologies used for knowledge transfer by employees should allow for high UA through their ability to select solutions that they find convenient, use of preferred platforms, personalize applications and utilize devices and software in various environments. They should not be simplified and should have the same functionality and efficiency of use as alternative solutions like web and desktop applications, even if additional effort to learn them would be required. Mobile technologies that take into account UA and RU support the process of employees capturing, distributing and effectively using knowledge. Originality/value: The elaborated model provides a valuable solution with practical implications for increasing mobile technologies acceptance for knowledge transfer. The study results contribute both to knowledge management and technology acceptance research fields by introducing two new determinants for the acceptance of technologies in knowledge transfer, such as UA and RU with several additional connections between existing UTAUT variables.

AB  - Background: While most young people who smoke want to quit, few access cessation support services. Mobile phone-based cessation programs are ideal for young people: mobile phones are the most common means of peer communication, and messages can be delivered in an anonymous manner, anywhere, anytime. Following the success of our text messaging smoking cessation program, we developed an innovative multimedia mobile phone smoking cessation intervention. Objective: The aim of the study was to develop and pilot test a youth-oriented multimedia smoking cessation intervention delivered solely by mobile phone. Methods: Development included creating content and building the technology platform. Content development was overseen by an expert group who advised on youth development principles, observational learning (from social cognitive theory), effective smoking cessation interventions, and social marketing. Young people participated in three content development phases (consultation via focus groups and an online survey, content pre-testing, and selection of role models). Video and text messages were then developed, incorporating the findings from this research. Information technology systems were established to support the delivery of the multimedia messages by mobile phone. A pilot study using an abbreviated 4-week program of video and text content tested the reliability of the systems and the acceptability of the intervention. Results: Approximately 180 young people participated in the consultation phase. There was a high priority placed on music for relaxation (75%) and an interest in interacting with others in the program (40% would read messages, 36% would read a blog). Findings from the pre-testing phase (n = 41) included the importance of selecting "real" and "honest" role models with believable stories, and an interest in animations (37%). Of the 15 participants who took part in the pilot study, 13 (87%) were available for follow-up interviews at 4 weeks: 12 participants liked the program or liked it most of the time and found the role model to be believable; 7 liked the role model video messages (5 were unsure); 8 used the extra assistance for cravings; and 9 were happy with two messages per day. Nine participants (60%) stopped smoking during the program. Some technical challenges were encountered during the pilot study. Conclusions: A multimedia mobile phone smoking cessation program is technically feasible, and the content developed is appropriate for this medium and is acceptable to our target population. These results have informed the design of a 6-month intervention currently being evaluated for its effectiveness in increasing smoking cessation rates in young people. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Objective: To define the natural history of X-linked myotubular myopathy (MTM). Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study that included an online survey (n = 35) and a prospective, 1-year longitudinal investigation using a phone survey (n = 33). Results: We ascertained data from 50 male patients with MTM and performed longitudinal assessments on 33 affected individuals. Consistent with existing knowledge, we found that MTM is a disorder associated with extensive morbidities, including wheelchair (86.7% nonambulant) and ventilator (75% requiring > 16 hours of support) dependence. However, unlike previous reports and despite the high burden of disease, mortality was lower than anticipated (approximate rate 10%/y). Seventy-six percent of patients with MTM enrolled (mean age 10 years 11 months) were alive at the end of the study. Nearly all deaths in the study were associated with respiratory failure. In addition, the disease course was more stable than expected, with few adverse events reported during the prospective survey. Few non–muscle-related morbidities were identified, although an unexpectedly high incidence of learning disability (43%) was noted. Conversely, MTM was associated with substantial burdens on patient and caregiver daily living, reflected by missed days of school and lost workdays. Conclusions: MTM is one of the most severe neuromuscular disorders, with affected individuals requiring extensive mechanical interventions for survival. However, among study participants, the disease course was more stable than predicted, with more individuals surviving infancy and early childhood. These data reflect the disease burden of MTM but offer hope in terms of future therapeutic intervention. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In this chapter, we present a new randomizing device. It uses a 'randomizing question' and comprises several desirable properties. Besides its ease of use and its applicability in all survey situations, it allows for increasing the statistical efficiency of the Randomized Response Technique (RRT) without jeopardizing respondents' perceived privacy protection. For the latter, the method makes use of Benford's law and takes advantage of respondents' misperception of the properties of Benford-distributed numbers such as, in our example, house numbers. We show how this method can be implemented and we present results of its first large-scale empirical evaluation in an online survey on student cheating. Furthermore, we will discuss the important difference between respondents' objective privacy protection in RRT designs and their subjectively perceived privacy protection.

AB  - Mobile device proficiency is increasingly required to participate in society. Unfortunately, there still exists a digital divide between younger and older adults, especially with respect to mobile devices (i.e., tablet computers and smartphones). Training is an important goal to ensure that older adults can reap the benefits of these devices. However, efficient/effective training depends on the ability to gauge current proficiency levels. We developed a new scale to accurately assess the mobile device proficiency of older adults: the Mobile Device Proficiency Questionnaire (MDPQ). We present and validate the MDPQ and a short 16-question version of the MDPQ (MDPQ-16). The MDPQ, its subscales, and the MDPQ-16 were found to be highly reliable and valid measures of mobile device proficiency in a large sample. We conclude that the MDPQ and MDPQ-16 may serve as useful tools for facilitating mobile device training of older adults and measuring mobile device proficiency for research purposes.

AB  - Using images of objects as queries is a new approach to search for information on the Web. Image-based information retrieval goes beyond only matching images, as information in other modalities also can be extracted from data collections using an image search. We have developed a new system that uses images to search for web-based information. This paper has a particular focus on exploring users’ experience of general mobile image-based web searches to find what issues and phenomena it contains. This was achieved in a multi part study by creating and letting respondents test prototypes of mobile image-based search systems and collect data using interviews, observations, video observations, and questionnaires. We observed that searching for information based only on visual similarity and without any assistance is sometimes difficult, especially on mobile devices with limited interaction bandwidth. Most of our subjects preferred a search tool that guides the users through the search result based on contextual information, compared to presenting the search result as a plain ranked list.

AB  - We conducted a pilot study to assess the feasibility of a web-based therapy management system with mobile phone access to support obese patients. A total of 25 patients participated in the study. The mean age of the patients was 48 years. The mean body mass index of the patients at recruitment was 35.6 kg/m². The mean observation period was 70 days. A total of 361 successful data transmissions was performed—the mean number of transmissions per patient was 14. The total number of outgoing reminder messages was 123, corresponding to 4.9 reminder messages per patient. At the end of the study, there were significant reductions of 2.4 cm in abdominal girth (P < 0.001), 2.4 kg in bodyweight (P < 0.001) and 0.78 kg/m² in body mass index (P < 0.001). In a questionnaire at the end of the study, the majority of the participants gave answers that indicated a positive attitude towards the system. The pilot study showed that mobile phones can be utilized as patient terminals for therapy in patients suffering from obesity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - A number of papers have surveyed mobile crowdsourcing systems and, to a lesser extent, situated crowdsourcing systems. These surveys have either contributed a comprehensive taxonomy of the diverse application domains where the systems have tapped into or have characterized different components of the system platforms. In this paper, we present a survey of mobile and situated crowdsourcing systems by addressing fundamental questions about user contributions that system designers pose when building new systems or evaluating existing ones. We select and analyze 40 mobile and situated crowdsourcing systems for which prototypes were deployed and studied in the real world. Inspired by the MIT's genetic model of collective intelligence, we propose our genetic model and new genes for mobile and situated crowdsourcing systems by examining user contributions to the selected systems. We present the observed patterns of different genes and discuss how the model can be used to create new applications and design ideas. By reviewing the existing design principles of online communities, we also provide examples to illustrate how unique genes inspire new design suggestions for encouraging user contributions in the context of mobile and situated crowdsourcing.

AB  - An increasing number of people are tracking their fitness activities, work performance and leisure experiences using body sensors (e.g., wristbands or smartwatches) and mobile applications. This trend, referred to as self-quantification, is driven by various motivations, from curiosity to a desire to improve performance. As self-quantification by means of digital devices is a new behavioural trend, the phenomenon has only recently received academic attention. Neither antecedents nor the implications of this phenomenon have been thoroughly investigated. This paper aims to address these gaps. Based on the literature on self-quantification, privacy and self-disclosure, we empirically test the relationship among personality traits, privacy, self-quantification and self-disclosure. The findings suggest that conscientiousness and emotional stability are associated with self-quantification. In addition, we find a significant effect of self-quantification on self-disclosure in the survey context, indicating that individuals who habitually use self-tracking applications and wearable devices are also more likely to disclose personal data in other contexts.

AB  - Purpose: A questionnaire survey was conducted to collect information from clinical audiologists about rehabilitation options for adult patients who report significant auditory difficulties despite having normal or near-normal hearing sensitivity. This work aimed to provide more information about what audiologists are currently doing in the clinic to manage auditory difficulties in this patient population and their views on the efficacy of recommended rehabilitation methods. Method: A questionnaire survey containing multiple-choice and open-ended questions was developed and disseminated online. Invitations to participate were delivered via e-mail listservs and through business cards provided at annual audiology conferences. All responses were anonymous at the time of data collection. Results: Responses were collected from 209 participants. The majority of participants reported seeing at least one normal-hearing patient per month who reported significant communication difficulties. However, few respondents indicated that their location had specific protocols for the treatment of these patients. Counseling was reported as the most frequent rehabilitation method, but results revealed that audiologists across various work settings are also successfully starting to fit patients with mild-gain hearing aids. Responses indicated that patient compliance with computer-based auditory training methods was regarded as low, with patients generally preferring device-based rehabilitation options. Conclusions: Results from this questionnaire survey strongly suggest that audiologists frequently see normal-hearing patients who report auditory difficulties, but that few clinicians are equipped with established protocols for diagnosis and management. While many feel that mild-gain hearing aids provide considerable benefit for these patients, very little research has been conducted to date to support the use of hearing aids or other rehabilitation options for this unique patient population. This study reveals the critical need for additional research to establish evidence-based practice guidelines that will empower clinicians to provide a high level of clinical care and effective rehabilitation strategies to these patients.

AB  - The HCAHPS Survey obtains hospital patients’ experiences using four modes: Mail Only, Phone Only, Mixed (mail/phone follow-up), and Touch-Tone (push-button) Interactive Voice Response with option to transfer to live interviewer (TT-IVR/Phone). A new randomized experiment examines two less expensive modes: Web/Mail (mail invitation to participate by Web or request a mail survey) and Speech-Enabled IVR (SE-IVR/Phone; speaking to a voice recognition system; optional transfer to an interviewer). Web/Mail had a 12% response rate (vs. 32% for Mail Only and 33% for SE-IVR/Phone); Web/Mail respondents were more educated and less often Black than Mail Only respondents. SE-IVR/Phone respondents (who usually switched to an interviewer) were less often older than 75 years, more often English-preferring, and reported better care than Mail Only respondents. Concerns regarding inconsistencies across implementations, low adherence to primary modes, or low response rate may limit the applicability of the SE-IVR/Phone and Web/Mail modes in HCAHPS and similar standardized environments.

AB  - Adjudicated youth in residential treatment facilities (RTFs) have high rates of trauma exposure and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study evaluated strategies for implementing trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) in RTF. Therapists (N = 129) treating adjudicated youth were randomized by RTF program (N = 18) to receive one of the two TF-CBT implementation strategies: (1) web-based TF-CBT training + consultation (W) or (2) W + 2 day live TF-CBT workshop + twice monthly phone consultation (W + L). Youth trauma screening and PTSD symptoms were assessed via online dashboard data entry using the University of California at Los Angeles PTSD Reaction Index. Youth depressive symptoms were assessed with the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire–Short Version. Outcomes were therapist screening; TF-CBT engagement, completion, and fidelity; and youth improvement in PTSD and depressive symptoms. The W + L condition resulted in significantly more therapists conducting trauma screening (p = .0005), completing treatment (p = .03), and completing TF-CBT with fidelity (p = .001) than the W condition. Therapist licensure significantly impacted several outcomes. Adjudicated RTF youth receiving TF-CBT across conditions experienced statistically and clinically significant improvement in PTSD (p = .001) and depressive (p = .018) symptoms. W + L is generally superior to W for implementing TF-CBT in RTF. TF-CBT is effective for improving trauma-related symptoms in adjudicated RTF youth. Implementation barriers are discussed.

AB  - This article briefs the processes regarding surveys. Part of the attractiveness of online research continues to lie in its low cost (see Duffy et al. 2005 for other reasons for its attractiveness). For instance, the cost today for a completed interview through an online omnibus survey can be as low as $2 in the US. In comparison, the cost for a completed interview through a telephone survey employing a dual frame (landline via random digit dialling and mobile phone via direct dialling) methodology can be at least five times higher. In some respects, however, online research has been a victim of its own success. Despite the increase in the number of panels and the development of new ways of accessing and utilising respondents, researchers can still find it difficult to complete the needed number of interviews on time. This is particularly true when the target population is rare or in high demand. For all of these reasons, it is common today for researchers to use more than one sample source for some types of projects, such as a tracking survey that measures change over time.

AB  - Technology can help support the goal of many older adults to live independently, though cognitive, attitudinal, and other barriers often result in a 'digital divide' in which older adults use and adopt new technology at a lower rate compared to younger adults. Due to the many potential benefits of technology it is not surprising that interest in tools that assess technology proficiency among older adults has increased. These tools can help support older adult technology research and training. However, to understand these issues more broadly, especially cross-cultural determinants of technology proficiency, translated, validated, and standardized measures of proficiency are necessary. For example, according to the last Eurobarometer (European Commission, 2015), Spain has experienced the largest increase in technology adoption among European Union nations in the past few years, indicating potential cultural mediation of technology adoption and use. To benefit the investigation of cross-cultural differences and their causes, we adapted the Mobile Device Proficiency Questionnaire (MDPQ) and Computer Proficiency Questionnaire (CPQ) for older adults in Spain, including the full and brief forms of each measure. Consistent with English versions of the questionnaires, the scales and their subscales were found to be reliable and valid measures of mobile device and computer proficiency in Spanish older adults. However, in contrast to earlier studies, the factor structure for both questionnaires simplified into two factors for the population under study. We conclude that the Spanish versions of the MDPQ and CPQ can be employed as useful tools for measuring mobile device and computer proficiency in the Spanish older adult population for research and training purposes.

AB  - Today, the learning model of a single instructor interacting with many students that is applied in conventional classrooms forms a passive bottleneck. Moreover, the instructor cannot effectively record students’ individual learning histories for instantaneous and suitable feedback. To address these issues using a mobile learning system (MLS) the authors have applied the principles of human-computer interaction (HCI) to construct a usable MLS on a personal digital assistant (PDA) The research focuses on adaptive content delivery within the context of small-screen design. The authors utilized task analysis, a literature review, experimental design and approaches to small-screen design, and addressed potential issues with presentation in order to design a friendly PDA interface whose performance was analyzed with a post-experiment user satisfaction questionnaire. The results of this experiment show that the mobile-based classroom learning experience provides appropriate mobile tools to help students to become capable, self-reliant, self-motivated, and independent. The findings also demonstrate that variations among students’ preference for content are associated with differences in the display presentation mode, and that the landscape interface is recommended for use in some contexts.

AB  - Aim: To identify management practices of Australian speech-language pathologists (SLPs) in the treatment of non-progressive dysarthria using a subsystem approach, and to explore SLPs’ consideration and implementation of the theoretical underpinnings of non-progressive dysarthria management. Method: A 39-item online survey was distributed to Australian SLPs, with 80 responses suitable for data analysis. Results: Practices of SLPs were variable for the management of the speech subsystems. The Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT®) was the most commonly used manualised treatment program, and was employed by 63.77% of respondents. Almost all SLPs (>88%) provided strategies to improve functional communication. There was no clear preference for low tech alternative and augmentative communication (AAC) devices. Speech generating devices were the most commonly employed high tech device. Almost two-thirds of respondents used non-speech oral motor exercises (NSOMEs) in treatment. SLPs had varied frequencies and models of service delivery for intervention. SLPs valued interventions targeting the activity and participation domains of the ICF, however this was restricted by the treatment context and resources available. The majority of SLPs (92.06%) were aware of the principles of motor learning, however many were unsure regarding the specifics of implementation. Conclusion: There is a clear need for further research into the efficacy of treatment techniques to guide decision-making. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Introduction: The literature indicates that few studies have been conducted with persons with visual impairments (that is, those who are blind or have low vision) concerning mobile application or 'app' usage. The current study explores the use of mobile apps with this population globally. Methods: A total of 259 participants with visual impairments completed an online survey. Descriptive statistics and bivariate tests were used to examine associations between demographic characteristics and mobile app use. Results: The participants rated special apps as useful (95.4%) and accessible (91.1%) tools for individuals with visual impairments. More than 90% of the middle-aged adult group strongly agreed with the practicality of special apps, a significantly higher percentage than was observed in the young and old adult groups. In addition, the participants with low vision considered special apps less accessible than did those with blindness (p > .05). Discussion: Results show that persons with visual impairments frequently use apps specifically designed for them to accomplish daily activities. Furthermore, this population is satisfied with mobile apps and would like to see improvements and new apps. Implications for practitioners: Developers of apps for individuals with visual impairments need to refine and test the existing apps. Practitioners need to be knowledgeable about app usage so they can provide effective instruction to their students or clients. This study provides preliminary information regarding app usage among persons with visual impairments. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The advancement of wireless and mobile technologies has enabled students to learn in an environment that combines learning resources from both the real world and the digital world. Although such an approach has been recognized as being innovative and important, several problems have been revealed in practical learning activities. One major problem is owing to the lack of proper learning strategies or tools for assisting the students to acquire knowledge in such a complex learning scenario. Students might feel excited or engaged when using the mobile devices to learn in the real context; nevertheless, their learning achievements could be disappointing. To deal with this problem, this study presents a mobile learning system that employs Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to detect and examine real-world learning behaviors of students. This study also utilizes each student’s responses from a two-tier test (i.e., multiple-choice questions in a two-level format) to provide personalized learning guidance (called two-tier test guiding, T³G). The experimental results from a natural science course of an elementary school show that this innovative approach is able to improve the learning achievements of students as well as enhance their learning motivation.

AB  - Studies have shown that any information and communication technology (ICT) intervention that improves the livelihoods of poor rural families is likely to have a significant impact (direct and indirect) on enhancing agricultural production, marketing, and post-harvest activities. Notable ICT services include: online information services; communication between researchers, extension (knowledge) workers, and farmers; updates on current market information; weather forecasting; input supplies; and credit availability. The lack of up-to-date ICTs can negatively affect information access and utilization among information users. The study sought to investigate the levels of ICT access and utilization by researchers and extension workers within the Ministry of Agriculture, Mechanisation and Irrigation Development and how this affected the generation and dissemination of agricultural information among researchers and extension workers. Survey questionnaires were distributed to researchers at the various institutes in the five agro-ecological zones and to extension workers in 10 provinces. The study revealed that the role of ICTs in work and as an information channel was considered inadequate despite the indications by the majority of extension workers and researchers that they had access to ICTs. Findings on the utilization of ICTs in managing information generated by the Departments of Research and Specialist Services and Agricultural Technical and Extension Services revealed that while some ICTs were used to generate documents, most distribution of documents involved hard copies. Available ICTs included computers, printers, telephones, television, Internet, mobile phones, and fax machines, and these were considered effective in the dissemination of agricultural information, although the levels of effectiveness varied according to the resources and respondents.

AB  - This study was designed to examine the manner by which academic personnel including students, faculty, librarians and administrators, not only access and read scientific literature bust also interacts with it. In addition, the study examines whether there are differences in accessing, reading and interaction behavior between different groups in academia. Using an online survey, which was completed by 416 respondents worldwide, we found that PDF is the most common format for reading, downloading and saving. Despite the advances of technology, most participants prefer to print PDF pages and note, highlight and summarize them manually. Mobile devices such as E-readers, tablets and smart phones are not very popular as means of interaction with scientific literature. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Objective: JUUL-brand electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) contain higher levels of nicotine than other e-cigarettes. The current study examined the relationship between young adults’ self-reported addiction and measured JUUL dependence. Methods: This study used a sequential, explanatory mixed methods design. Data were collected from a large, southwestern college in the US. College students who were weekly JUUL users and owned a JUUL device (n = 595) completed a cross-sectional online survey, then a subsample (n = 51) participated in in-person interviews. All data were collected between March-April 2019. T-tests were used to examine differences between JUUL dependence and self-reported addiction, and logistic regressions were employed to examine factors that may influence self-reported addiction to JUUL, nicotine, and other e-cigarettes. Interviews were independently coded by 2 coders (kappa ranged from 0.46 to 0.99) then analyzed for corresponding themes. Results: Participants who had a higher JUUL dependence were more likely to report addiction to several substances/products, including nicotine, JUULs, cigarettes, other e-cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana. Interview participants minimized JUUL addiction by comparing JUUL to other socially acceptable addictions and describing JUUL addiction as a habit. Interview participants suggested addiction to nicotine was more stigmatizing than JUUL. The number of days participants used JUUL per week, use of traditional tobacco products, and measured JUUL dependence were each associated with self-reported JUUL addiction. Conclusions: Social construction of self-reported addictions may be changing young audiences’ views of addiction to JUUL. Research is needed to see if using the phrase ‘nicotine dependence’ rather than ‘JUUL addiction’ influences young adults’ JUUL use. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Purpose: Electronic cigarettes (e cigarettes) are a new type of device that delivers vaporized nicotine without the tobacco combustion of regular cigarettes. We sought to understand aware ness of and willingness to try e cigarettes among adolescent males, a group that is at risk for smoking initiation and may use e cigarettes as a 'gateway' to smoking. Methods: A national sample of 11-19 year old males (n = 228) completed an online survey in November 2011. We recruited participants through their parents, who were members of a panel of U.S. households constructed using random digit dialing and addressed based sampling. Results: Only two participants (< 1%) had previously tried e cigarettes. Among those who had not tried e cigarettes, most (67%) had heard of them. Awareness was higher among older and non Hispanic adolescents. Nearly 1 in 5 (18%) participants were willing to try either a plain or flavored e cigarette, but willingness to try plain versus flavored varieties did not differ. Smokers were more willing to try any e cigarette than nonsmokers (74% vs. 13%; OR 10.25, 95% CI 2.88, 36.46). Nonsmokers who had more negative beliefs about the typical smoker were less willing to try e cigarettes (OR .58, 95% CI .43, .79). Conclusions: Most adolescent males were aware of e cigarettes, and a substantial minority were willing to try them. Given that even experimentation with e cigarettes could lead to nicotine dependence and subsequent use of other tobacco products, regulatory and behavioral interventions are needed to prevent 'gateway' use by adolescent nonsmokers. Campaigns promoting negative images of smokers or FDA bans on sales to youth may help deter use. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - We examined how family communication patterns (FCPs) are associated with frequency of adolescent–parent communication in person, over the phone, via text message, and via email. Adolescents (N = 195) aged 13 to 18 completed an online survey assessing FCPs and frequency of communication methods used with parents. The results revealed that both frequency and method of communication differed by general FCPs; adolescents in higher conformity families reported less frequent text messaging with mothers than adolescents in lower conformity families, and adolescents in higher conversation families (mothers only) and lower conformity families reported more frequent email communication with parents. Results set the stage for future research to further explore the processes and outcomes of adolescent–parent communication through communication technology.

AB  - This study examines factors influencing adoption and use of computer-based voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) phone service and attempts to integrate 2 theoretical approaches: the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the uses and gratifications framework. Using data from an online survey of VoIP users (N = 420), structural equation modeling analyses revealed that perceived ease of use had a significant impact on perceived usefulness. In addition, perceived usefulness had a positive effect on actual VoIP use. The study further discovered that motivations for communication and instrumental use significantly affected perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and actual VoIP use. This study suggests that integration of TAM and uses and gratifications can be fruitful in understanding user acceptance of new communication technologies.

AB  - The adoption of ride-sharing apps is critical to the survival of taxi drivers in the mobile-driven sharing economy. Based on survey data collected from 1195 licensed taxi drivers in Beijing, the authors present an integrated technology adoption model that combines technology and use factors (perceived usefulness and ease of use), social factors (word-of-mouth, peer adoption and subjective norms), system factors (socioeconomic and digital inequality), and audience factors (demographic characteristics and innovative personality traits). The results showed that adoption was innate, inherited, and socially driven. Adoption was positively associated with income, access to technologies, innovative personality trait, peer adoption, word-of-mouth, and perceived usefulness of the apps. The implications of the findings for inequality in the sharing economy are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Technology acceptance theories predict user intentions to use services tailored for organisational needs. However, in this paper, we postulate that the aforementioned theories do not apply when investigating intentions towards the use of mobile data services (MDS), as the latter encompasses supplementary characteristics, such as fun and enjoyment, which are not taken into account under available models of user acceptance. The incorporation of the affective dimension is proposed by reintroducing the Triandis theory of human behaviour to the MDS domain. A web-based survey (N = 219) was conducted to investigate our research hypotheses and validate our model of MDS usage intention. Results showed that the MDS usage intention can be predicted by cognitive and affective factors under the lens of social influences. Additionally, the main antecedents of MDS actual use are perceived usefulness, perceived value and intention to use MDS. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Previous research has highlighted age-related differences in social perception, in particular emotional expression processing. To date, such studies have largely focused on approaches that use static emotional stimuli that the participant has to identify passively without the possibility of any interaction. In this study, we propose an interactive virtual environment to better address age-related variations in social and emotional perception. A group of 22 young (18–30 years) and 20 older (60–80 years) adults were engaged in a face-to-face conversation with an embodied conversational agent. Participants were invited to interact naturally with the agent and to identify his facial expression. Their gaze behaviour was captured by an eye-tracking device throughout the interaction. We also explored whether the Big Five personality traits (particularly extraversion) and anxiety modulated gaze during the social interaction. Findings suggested that age-related differences in gaze behaviour were only apparent when decoding social signals (i.e., listening to a partner’s question, identifying facial expressions) and not when communicating social information (i.e., when speaking). Furthermore, higher extraversion levels consistently led to a shorter amount of time gazing towards the eyes, whereas higher anxiety levels led to slight modulations of gaze only when participants were listening to questions. Face-to-face conversation with virtual agents can provide a more naturalistic framework for the assessment of online socio-emotional interaction in older adults, which is not easily observable in classical offline paradigms. This study provides novel and important insights into the specific circumstances in which older adults may experience difficulties in social interactions.

AB  - Due to increasing internet and mobile penetration, children in India are at risk of cyberbullying. A survey of 174 middle graders in Delhi showed that, of total, 8% indulged in cyberbullying and 17% reported being victimized by such acts. However, prevalence of in-person bullying, fighting and victimization by either was 16%, 12% and 17% respectively. Males were more likely to bully and fight in-person than females. They were also more likely to be victims of both online and offline aggression. Interwoven modes of bullying along with safe use of technology need to be understood.

AB  - Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) aims to improve all mobile applications such as m-learning systems. This study presents an innovative method to use web technology and software engineering’s best practices to provide m-learning functionalities hosted in a MCC-learning system as service. Components hosted by MCC are used to empower developers to create m-learning systems in agile manner. The developed m-learning systems -as tenants of MCC-learning- provide cloud-quality services to their clients. The solution is a service-oriented and three-layered MCC system encompassing innovative m-learning components. To adapt e-contents sent to clients, a Device-Adaptive-Rendering component is used which takes platform, capability, physical and other contextual diversities of mobile devices into account. Using MCC increases the development speed and decreases the Lines Of Code (LOC) to build m-learning systems. Experiment outcomes demonstrate improvement in time taken by learners to answer the learning task questions and accuracy rates. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Reading is considered as essential to develop the personality of human being. However, reading habits of human being especially young generation is at decline due to initiation of modern digital technologies like mobile phones, social networking on internet along with other ways of different entertainment. The study was conducted to assess the reading habits of the agricultural students of different universities in Punjab, Pakistan and identify the different ways of reading habit among students and obstacles in reading faced by students. The findings of the questionnaire showed the positive attitude of agricultural students in reading but they face some problems like no access of internet in Departments and computer laboratories especially in University of Sargodha and Bahauddin Zakariya University, Multan. This study also attempts to give recommendations for improving the reading habits of students. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This article draws on work from a 6-month project with 12 young mothers in which we mapped and tracked ourselves and our infants. The project employed a range of methods including digital ethnographies, walk-along methods, hacking and playful experimentations. We explored, broke and tested a range of wearables and phone-based tracking apps, meeting regularly to discuss and compare our experiences and interrogate the sociotechnical systems of postnatal healthcare alongside the particular politics of certain apps and their connective affordances. In this article, I use the project as a springboard to explore what I call algorithmic vulnerabilities: the ways that the contemporary datalogical anthropocene is exposing and positioning subjects in ways that not only rarely match their own lived senses of identity but are also increasingly difficult to interrupt or disrupt. While this is not necessarily a new phenomenon (see Clough et al., 2015; Hayles, 2017), I argue that the particular algorithmic vulnerabilities within this context, which are forged in part through the ideological enmeshing of the long-running atomization of maternal and infant bodies within the healthcare systems (Crowe, 1987; Shaw, 2012; Wajcman, 1991) and the new and emergent tracking apps (Greenfield, 2016; Lupton, 2016; O'Riordan, 2017) create momentary stabilizations of sociotechnical systems in which maternal subjectivity and female embodiment become algorithmically vulnerable in affective and profound ways. These stabilizations become increasingly and problematically normative, partly because they feed and perpetuate a wider 'taken-for granted' sensibility of gendered neoliberalism (Gill, 2017: 609) which, as I argue, is coming to encapsulate the contemporary datalogical anthropocene. Secondly, the sociotechnical politics of the apps and the healthcare systems are revealed as co-dependent, raising a number of questions about long-term algorithmic vulnerabilities and normativities which predate the contemporary datalogical 'turn' and impact both practices and methods.

AB  - Multicommunicating via mobile phone during face-to-face encounters with family and friends was examined with data from an online survey of 432 adults in the US. Multicommunicating was positively associated with problematic mobile phone use and explained by attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms and a social need to belong. Those with ADHD symptoms were more likely to engage in problematic mobile phone use and frequent multicommunicating. Strong need for social assurance, which involves an "always-on-and-connected" lifestyle through mobile devices, explained problematic mobile phone use and multicommunicating. Need for social assurance also was related to multicommunicating via social connectedness, and this effect was significant among females, but not males. The implications of these findings for future research are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Digital mobile communication tools have become cultural artefacts for everyday sociability. As technology use becomes pervasive in society, it brings many advantages for everyday social relations, but these benefits come in tandem with some disadvantages and unintended consequences. One such consequence is the tendency for people to be distracted due to technology use while driving. The focus of this study was to explore the prevalence of texting, making phone calls, and other technology use, such as adjusting or tuning dashboard music players or radios, while driving. Through a survey of drivers, roadside ethnographic observations of drivers, and interviews with traffic officers in Polokwane, Limpopo, South Africa, the study broadly examined the social and cultural impact of technology and mobility with specific focus on technology use and distracted driving. The findings revealed a prevalence for texting and driving: 60 per cent of the participants reported that they have sent a text while driving; and 88 per cent acknowledged that they have seen drivers texting while driving. The study is significant considering the limited research on this social issue in South Africa, and it is also relevant considering that technology use and distraction portends the potential for causing road accidents.

AB  - The author explores communication mobility and its implications for those who live in the upper strata of the advanced industrial societies. The professionals who 'phone it in' are scrutinized from a sociological view. So too are today's teens who apparently experience Paris as an opportunity for texting rather than a romantic or political engagement. Mobile connectivity while away from home leaves little time to inquire, as perhaps both Adolph Hitler and Jacques Chirac did in their day, 'Is Paris Burning?' She also examines the digital dustbin awaiting those who are no longer wanted in the brave new technological world. In the process of her examination, she raises important questions about the use of human beings as the opportunities grow to leave emotional work to the infinite patience of robotic pets.

AB  - Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) techniques are employed to mediate communication with people who have communication disorders, as in cases of intellectual disability. Although there are various digital solutions that promote alternative communication options for individuals with communication disorders, only a few of them have been specifically designed or targeted to people with intellectual disability (ID). This work is motivated by the lack of AAC solutions contributing to the rehabilitation processes of individuals with intellectual disability in Brazil. The study presents a mobile-based AAC solution conceived as a tool to assist the rehabilitation process of people with ID. The design was based on user-centered design principles and accessibility standards. The System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire was used to evaluate the solution. Four specialists and twenty-five students participated in this study. The proposed solution shows the potential educational value for professionals who assist individuals with intellectual disability in Brazil.

AB  - The wave of the current unprecedented advancements in Information and Communication Technology, which spread in Nigeria, nay Africa is becoming unfathomable has some linguistic implications worthy of philosophical appraisal. The chapter discusses how the new digital milieu is changing human understanding and use of language in social and formal discourse. Contrary to the popular assumptions that the digital communication feat is holistically advantageous, the chapter argues that the advent of digital communication in Nigeria has occasioned unconsciously, more linguistic and social problems on the psyche of Nigerians. Through a careful survey of the style of sending text messages and mails via mobile phones and the Internet, the chapter establishes that Nigerians adopt pragmatic approach, which defies any respect for grammatical and linguistic rules in digital communication. Though, this ideological basis, the chapter argues, might hold some immediate communication effects for the senders and recipients; in spite of these supposed benefits, the chapter argues that the pragmatic approach to digital communication in Nigeria is inadequate. Thus, a case is made in the chapter for a more resonant underlying philosophy of language, which will guide digital communication in contemporary Nigeria.

AB  - The ubiquity of mobile devices and the apps that power them has spurred concerns that they are contributing to the decline in news media use. Mobile devices, however, have been credited with spurring political participation. In its examination of app-reliant individuals, this study found that reliance on apps positively predicts political participation, and respondents who rely heavily on mobile apps for political information are more politically active than light app users on six of the seven measures of nononline participation and three of the six measures of online political activity. Heavy-reliant users also rely more heavily on all six online-only media tested than light app users and rely more heavily on broadcast television news, CNN, and news magazines. Data were collected from October 31, 2016, through November 2, 2016, from 644 respondents of a national online panel. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The pursuit of beautiful appearance for human greatly inspires the studies on digital beautifiers especially for the popularity of social networking services (SNS) in this booming era of mobile phones. Unfortunately, existing beautification techniques are not efficient enough for mobile devices that have limited computation and storage resources. In this paper, we propose a beautifier that is efficient on both space and time, and develop a mobile APP available online. We focus on the local beautification of facial chin that has a great effect on facial attractiveness, and simply use an averaged chin shape as the template. We leverage Laplacian as the constraint to remap the original shape to the target, and recursively apply the Laplacian constraint to the contour points from the coarse to fine scales. Thus, we only need to inverse a small matrix for the remap, which requires quite low expenses on space and time. Finally, we apply an efficient warping algorithm based on triangular meshes to generate a beautified face image. The performance of the algorithm is validated by a survey on 70 facial images since no objective metric for beauty exists. Twenty volunteers are invited to grade the results labeled as ‘worse’, ‘unchanged’ and ‘better’. The results show that 81.50% of inputs are believed becoming more beautiful, and another 10.07% of them are considered unchanged. We also provide the comparisons on the beautification quality and time expenses with the algorithm based on radial basis functions (RBF). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

In the original article, corrections by the authors were not made before the publication of the Version of Record. The corrections have now been made; a list of each correction is given in erratum.] As public sector work environments continue to embrace the digital governance revolution, questions of work surveillance practices and its relationship to performance management continue to evolve, but even more dramatically in the contemporary period of many public servants being forced to shift to remote work from home in response to the COVID‐19 pandemic. This article presents the results of three surveys, two of them population‐based survey experiments, all conducted during the onset of the COVID‐19 pandemic in Canada that compare public servant (n = 346) and citizen (n = 1,008 phone; n = 2,001 web) attitudes to various cutting‐edge—though no doubt controversial among some—digital surveillance tools that can be used in the public sector to monitor employee work patterns, often targeted toward remote working conditions. The findings represent data that can help governments and public service associations navigate difficult questions of reasonable privacy intrusions in an increasing digitally connected workforce. Evidence for Practice New work surveillance technologies are available to use within the public sector and will present acceptability challenges to public managers as they contemplate the introduction of these technologies. Multimodal survey data from Canada reveals that public servants and citizens find these emerging work surveillance technologies to be quite intrusive and unreasonable but show relatively more tolerance for digital surveillance over physical surveillance practices. Understanding surveillance anxieties among targeted employees will be key to finding a balance between employee privacy rights and employer desires to manage employees in a remote or digital environment.

AB  - Purpose: This paper adopts a response hierarchy model to examine drivers’ intrinsic and extrinsic motivations for using mobile digital television (MDTV) while on the move. Design/methodology/approach: The study used a regional quota sampling method to examine the viewing habits of drivers who have a mobile digital television installed in their vehicles and was carried out in two steps. The first stage had interviews with eight car stereo distributors, and the second stage used a questionnaire to ascertain the viewing habits and content selection of drivers watching TV in their vehicles. Findings: SEM analysis of a survey of 480 MDTV-using drivers in Taiwan revealed an enjoyment-based model of MDTV use since enjoyment has the most significant effect on drivers’ affect, intention to use, and use behavior. Perceived ease of use and subjective norms had a lesser effect. The nonsignificant effect of concentration and perceived risk imply that while drivers enjoy watching MDTV, they do not believe they switch their primary attention from driving to programs. Since drivers do not think they concentrate on watching MDTV, program content has little chance to induce curiosity and increase viewing time, the real communicative effect of watching TV while driving must be sharply discounted. Research limitations/implications: The paper focuses exclusively on use of front-seat MDTV equipment by drivers, and does not attempt to examine MDTV use by other passengers in the same vehicle. Originality/value: This is the first study that has been undertaken of mobile digital television viewers, and the paper will be useful as a reference for those who are developing the mobile digital television market as they work to understand the needs and viewing habits of their audience.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to explore factors affecting individuals' usage of Mobile Securities Management System (MSMS). On the basis of an extensive review of literature in Task Technology Fit (TTF) theory and Mobile Commerce (MC) adoption, a revised TTF model is proposed and tested using data collected from an online survey of 440 respondents. The results show that: the fit between task and technology positively affects MSMS usage, while alternative systems play a negative role; functions of MSMS, self-efficacy and experience are important factors affecting the fit; MSMS adopting does not heavily depend on the macro-environment of the stock market. Implications for improving other types of MC applications adoption are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Some respondents already complete web surveys via mobile devices. These devices vary at several levels from PCs. In particular, we expect differences when grid questions are used due to the lower visibility on mobile devices and because in questionnaires optimized to be completed through smartphones, grids are split up into an item-by-item format. This paper reports the results of a two-wave experiment conducted in Spain in 2015, comparing three groups: PCs, smartphones not-optimized, or smartphones optimized. We found similar levels of interitem correlations, longer completion times for grid questions for smartphone respondents, and sometimes less non-differentiation for PCs. Thus, using the item-by-item format for smartphones and PCs seems the most appropriate way to improve comparability. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Teachers in the US have been increasingly adopting mobile devices for teaching, but little research has examined how pre-service teachers perceive mobile device integration in classrooms. To address this issue, the study developed a research model that explained factors affecting pre-service teachers’ intention to use mobile devices and the relationship among the factors. A total of 386 pre-service teachers participated in an online survey, and the model was tested using structural equation modeling. The results showed that 72.5% of variances in pre-service teachers' intention to use mobile devices were explained by perceived usefulness and self-efficacy for technology integration jointly, where perceived usefulness was the strongest predictor. The findings also demonstrated that constructivist beliefs and perceived ease of use indirectly influenced pre-service teachers’ intention to use mobile devices for teaching.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to perform an in situ assessment of office seating habits that influence chair testing and design. Background: Many chair testing parameters were derived decades ago when the average weight of people within the United States was dramatically lower and the office work tasks less computer based. Method: For the study, 51 participants were randomly selected from Brazos Valley, Texas, businesses to participate in 8-hr assessments of office seating habits. Overall results were compared with current chair testing and design assumptions. Data were collected through written survey and through data logging of seat and back contact pressure and duration with the use of the X-SENSOR™ pressure mapping device and software. Additionally, 1 day per participant of caster roll distance was recorded with the use of a caster mounted digital encoder. Participants were grouped by body mass index (BMI) and weight (BMI <35 and weight <102 kg or BMI >35 and weight >102 kg). Results: It was determined that a significant difference did exist between the groups in mean seat time per shift (p < .001), back cycles per shift (p < .002), seat cycles per shift (p < .01), and caster distance rolled per shift (p < .001). Conclusion: Several key parameters and assumptions of current chair test methods and design specifications may no longer be valid for the upper quartile of weight range of the current U.S. population. Application: The data collected in this study will enable engineers to determine whether revision of design standards for testing office seating for both normal weight and extremely obese workers is indicated.

AB  - Abstract: This study examines what factors lead to the adoption of the mobile e-book in South Korea. For this purpose, this research integrated the diffusion of innovation theory and technology acceptance model with the model of innovation resistance and applied this integrated model to the context of mobile e-book adoption. An online survey was administrated, and the data collected were analyzed with the structural equation model (SEM). Research results showed that individual innovativeness has a significant influence on perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. It also revealed that both of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use affect not only intention to use but also the innovation resistance. The innovation resistance has significant negative influence on the intention to use. Perceived risk of mobile e-books increases innovation resistance in a positive way. The implications of these results are discussed. [Copyright &y& Elsevier]

AB  - In recent years, digital learning has been converting from e‐learning to m‐learning because of the significant growth of wireless and mobile computing technologies. Students can learn any time and any where with mobile devices. Consequently, context‐aware ubiquitous learning (u‐learning) is emerging as a new research area. It integrates wireless, mobile and context awareness technologies in order to detect the situation of the learners and provide more seamless adaptive support in the learning process. In this paper, a context‐aware u‐learning environment is developed for learning about campus vegetation in elementary schools based on an innovative approach by employing repertory grid method in designing learning content. In addition, we probe the feasibility of context‐aware u‐learning in courses by soliciting feedback from the students and teachers through interviews and questionnaires. The findings reveal that the environment is capable of enhancing students’ motivation and learning effectiveness. Moreover, it is also capable of reducing the teaching load while enabling better control of class order. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Depression occurring during pregnancy and postpartum (i.e., the perinatal period) is common and associated with adverse outcomes for women and their offspring. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) has been shown to reduce risk for depressive relapse among at-risk individuals generally, and recent adaptations document the efficacy of MBCT among perinatal women specifically. In addition, MBCT, when delivered using a web-based format (Mindful Mood Balance [MMB] program), has demonstrated acceptability and feasibility for at-risk individuals generally. The aim of the present open trial study was to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary outcomes of MMB for use with pregnant women at risk for depressive relapse (N = 37). We predicted that MMB would be feasible and acceptable as assessed by session completion and participation in phone coaching calls, home practice completion, and self-reported satisfaction via questionnaire and interview. We also predicted that women would not demonstrate significant worsening of depression symptom severity during MMB, consistent with our focus on prevention. A brief case example based on a composite of participants is presented to illustrate the MMB structure and content and the phone coaching protocol. Participants demonstrated engagement with the program, reported perceiving benefits in the intended depression prevention targets of MMB, and sustained minimal to mild depressive symptom severity over the course of the program. Given these promising results and the potential benefits of averting depression for women and their families, further development and rigorous testing of MMB among at-risk pregnant women is warranted.

AB  - Abstract: Purpose: Smartphones facilitate the potential adoption of new mobile applications. The purpose of this research is to study users and non-users of three selected mobile applications, and find out what really drives the intention to use these applications across users and non-users. Design/methodology/approach: The authors measured actual usage of mobile applications in a panel study of 579 Finnish smartphone users, using in-device measurements as an objective way to identify users and non-users. A web-based survey was used in collecting data to test an extended TAM model in explaining intention to use. Findings: Perceived technological barriers negatively affect behavioural control, reflecting people’s assessment of themselves being capable of using the services without trouble. Behavioural control is directly linked to perceived usefulness (except for games) and perceived enjoyment, as hypothesized. Perceived enjoyment and usefulness were generically found to explain intention to use applications for both users and for non-users. Research limitations/implications: With regards to the impact of social norms, the study finds that further research needs to be done in exploring its impact more thoroughly. The dataset of the research, consisting purely of male-dominated, young smartphone users, make the generalization of results difficult. Practical implications: There are differences regarding what drives the usage of different kinds of mobile applications. In this study, map applications and mobile Internet, are driven by more utilitarian motivations, whereas games are more hedonic. It is also clear that not everybody are using applications facilitated by smartphones, and therefore the presented approach of studying users and non-users separately provides a new approach to analyze adoption on a practical level. Originality/value: This research proves that models like TAM should not treat mobile services as a generic concept, but instead to specifically address individual mobile services. The research also demonstrates the unique value of combining objective usage measurements (reflecting actual behaviour) with traditional survey data in more comprehensively modelling service adoption.

AB  - In recent years, mobile computing has shown so much potential that one can see a boundary-blurring expansion between the physical and the digital world. In this context, one of the most sought after research areas is mobile crowdsensing. To realize the vision of crowdsensing, there is a plethora of work in the literature that focuses on the technical capabilities of a mobile device. However, an important and a critical problem that eludes literature is the issue of human participation. We base this argument on a very simple, yet powerful fact that a mobile device is still a person’s private property. Therefore, considering human mentality, can we expect a person to contribute all the time? In this respect, it is not feasible for a human dependent computational system to ignore the inevitable human factor and focus only on the mechanical properties. In this paper, we look into the often ignored human aspects and will study the problem from a psychological perspective. We take inspiration from the mature paradigm of crowdsourcing and discuss the importance of a few human factors that could teach us how to encourage user participation in mobile crowdsensing. Further, we also explore a person’s habitual characteristics that could help answer the decade’s old question: How to get quality responses from the crowd? We use a psycho-technological approach to observe, understand, and find a few details regarding human behavior in online systems. Lastly, we take inspiration from the analysis to present a roadmap that aids in engineering a better and effective crowdsensing platform. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Most mobile devices nowadays have a camera. Besides, posting and sharing images have been found as one of the most frequent and engaging Internet activities. However, to our knowledge, no research has explored the feasibility of asking respondents of online surveys to upload images to answer survey questions. The main goal of this article is to investigate the viability of asking respondents of an online opt-in panel to upload during a mobile web survey: First, a photo taken in the moment, and second, an image already saved on their smartphone. In addition, we want to test to what extent the Google Vision application programming interface (API), which can label images into categories, produces similar tags than a human coder. Overall, results from a survey conducted among millennials in Spain and Mexico (N = 1,614) show that more than half of the respondents uploaded an image. Of those, 77.3% and 83.4%, respectively, complied with what the question asked. Moreover, respectively, 52.4% and 65.0% of the images were similarly codified by the Google Vision API and the human coder. In addition, the API codified 1,818 images in less than 5 min, whereas the human coder spent nearly 35 hours to complete the same task. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study investigates the relevant predictors of customer satisfaction and customer loyalty, and explores the group difference by innovativeness or device type, based on equity theory for emerging devices in the initial market of Korea. The results from an online survey of users of emerging devices and structural equation modeling indicate that utilitarian benefit, hedonic benefit, nonmonetary cost, and alternative attractiveness are significant predictors of customer satisfaction, which in turn affects customer loyalty. Hedonic benefit has a stronger relationship with customer satisfaction for more innovative users and nonmonetary cost has a stronger relationship with customer satisfaction for less innovative users. Nonmonetary cost has a negative relationship with customer satisfaction for netbooks; an additional exploratory analysis produced no such evidence for smartphones. These findings suggest managerial implications for customer loyalty regarding emerging devices. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In this article, we examine the epistemology of the camera today. In order to answer this question, we concentrate on three social and technological forms: the camera obscura, the photographic camera, and the digital camera. On the one hand, the camera extends our human sensibilities and helps us to obtain knowledge of the world. On the other hand, it works as a device for delusion, bodily vision and spectacle. Historically, these two functions are meshed together in complicated ways and this establishes the paradoxical epistemology of the camera. We argue that, even if contemporary debates about the truthfulness of the photographic image have persistently been tied to the digitisation of the photographic process, the very origin of these debates actually lies in the camera itself and its contradictory epistemology. The camera has worked, and still works, as an apparatus that relentlessly produces irresolvable ambiguity, aporia, between true knowledge and illusory vision. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - A key question for retailers who already offer a mobile website is, whether they should add an app as an additional purchase channel. We address this issue by exploring whether consumers' app adoption stimulates additional purchases and how this change in purchase behavior differs across customers with different levels of spending share for different product categories and customer loyalty. By using transactional data from a Chinese online retailer, we show that app adopters have higher purchase incidence, buy more frequently, and spend more in each order than non-adopters. We also find that app adoption has a stronger positive effect on the order size of customers who have a lower spending share of high-price products and customers who are less loyal to the focal retailer. Hereby, we contribute to multichannel and mobile marketing literature by empirically examining the effects of adding a similar (mobile) purchase channel to an already established (mobile) purchase channel. Managerially, our results suggest that apps are worth investing in despite their similarity to mobile websites and can induce non-loyal customers to purchase more and thus potentially foster these customers' loyalty.

AB  - The present study employs an audience-centered approach to examine motivations for mobile fitness app use. We explicate and test an Integrated Technology Adoption model, which incorporates perspectives on competition, self-esteem, self-efficacy, and audience uses and gratifications. An online survey of 469 respondents reveals that app adoption intentions were predicted by internal competition orientations and gratifications, exercise self-efficacy, social utility motives, and attitudes toward the app. External competition decreased behavioral intentions related to app use. Study results thus provide support for an integrative model linking social cognitive factors with a new set of mobile app uses and gratifications. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Populist parties are often argued to be very skilled in using digital media to attract supporters and strengthen linkages with their followers. However, only rarely has research shown this linkage empirically. This study explores whether arguments about the relation between digital platforms and populist voting can be substantiated using comparative survey data in France, Germany and Italy. Digital media include a variety of online platforms that can affect populist vote in different ways. This article addresses the relation between the political use of digital platforms and the populist vote. First, it looks at how the use of Social Networking Sites (SNS) and Mobile Instant Messaging Services (MIMS) is related to voting for populist parties. Second, it assesses whether the role of digital platforms is different for supporting digital 'immigrant' and digital 'native' populist parties. Third, it explores country differences in the relation between SNS and MIMS' use and the populist vote. Using original online surveys, the article shows that political activities on SNS and MIMS platforms (sending messages or posting, discussing or convincing others to vote for a candidate) increase the probability of voting for populist parties. However, it also finds that the political use of digital media is associated with the populist vote under certain (and limited) circumstances, that is only for a subset of populist parties. Finally, it identifies important differences in how SNS and MIMS are linked to the populist vote in countries presenting diverse institutional features, web regulations and constellations of media systems.

AB  - ABSTRACT Technological advancements and changes in online survey participation pave the way for new data collection methods. Particularly, the increasing smartphone rate in online surveys facilitates a re-consideration of prevailing communication channels to, for instance, naturalize the communication process between researchers and respondents and to collect more in-depth and high-quality data. However, so far, there is a lack of information on whether respondents are willing to undergo a change in communication channels. In this study, I therefore investigate respondents’ willingness to participate in online surveys with a smartphone to have the survey questions read out loud (audio channel) and to give oral answers via voice input (voice channel). For this purpose, I employed two willingness questions – one on audio and one on voice channels – in the probability-based German Internet Panel (N = 4,426). The results reveal that a substantial minority of respondents is willing to participate in online surveys with a smartphone to have the survey questions read out loud and to give oral answers via voice input. They also show that the device used for survey participation and personality traits, such as conscientiousness and extraversion, play a role when it comes to respondents’ willingness.

AB  - The development of web surveys has been accompanied by the emergence of new scales, taking advantages of the visual and interactive features provided by the Internet like drop-down menus, sliders, drag-and-drop, or order-by-click scales. This article focuses on the order-by-click scales, studying the comparability of the data obtained for this scale when answered through PCs versus smartphones. I used data from an experiment where panelists from the Netquest opt-in panel in Spain were randomly assigned to a PC, smartphone optimized, or smartphone not-optimized version of the same questionnaire in two waves. I found significant differences due to the device and optimization at least for some indicators and questions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In this study, we assessed the status of electronic recruitment for U.S. state government employees and analyzed the issues and challenges state governments faced while they implemented e-recruitment systems. All of the 23 state personnel agencies that responded to a phone survey either offered downloadable application forms or allowed candidates to submit applications online. Ten states had adopted options for assessing applicants and selecting job candidates online, but only three states reported that they had adopted online testing. The number of applications received online increased from 2002 to 2003, and the most common implementation challenges that states faced when introducing e-recruitment were budget constraints, technical difficulties, and HR staff adapting to using a new system. While 15 states reported that they evaluated their electronic recruitment system, only three said they measured the cost per hire. Based on the survey responses, we conclude this article by presenting lessons and implications for effectively implementing e-recruitment for state government employees.

AB  - The increasing popularity of text-based computer mediated communication, such as instant messaging and mobile texting, have resulted in the emergence of a new pictographic form of language, i.e. emoji, offering an intuitive and informal way to convey emotions and attitudes, replacing words or phrases in text messages. Based on these characteristics, could identification with emoji be associated with personality? Could they be used instead of text-based items in personality assessment? The present study aimed at exploring these questions. The sample is composed of 234 young adults recruited online (age: M = 24.79, SD = 6.47; 62% female). Participants responded to a brief Big-Five personality questionnaire and a 91-item survey assessing participants' degree of self-identification with emoji selected from the Apple Color Emoji fontset. Results indicated that 36 out of 91 examined emoji are significantly related with three of the Big-Five personality traits—emotional stability, extraversion, and agreeableness—that are consistently linked with emotion and affective processing. Emoji-based measures of these personality traits show moderate-to-large concurrent validity with scores from a validated personality questionnaire (r = 0.6–0.8). Overall, our study advances the idea that emoji might be employed to develop a language-free assessment tool for personality. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This article explores which antecedents explain intentions to adopt a mobile coaching app. To that end, this study describes a coaching service designed to guide/encourage students throughout their studies in order to validate a new model of planned behavior based on the Technology Acceptance Model and the Goal-Directed Behavioral theory. The methodology included a short qualitative study and an online survey to examine the theoretical model which is based on scales tested in previous studies. The convenience sample is composed of students (Bachelor and Master/MBA) with the results analyzed using structural equation modelling to test the proposed model’s causal structure. The results show different adoption patterns by gender and type of school. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

The corrected table is provided.] The time that children spend using digital devices is increasing rapidly with the development of new portable and instantly accessible technology, such as smartphones and digital tablets. Although prior studies have examined the effects of traditional media on children's development, there is limited evidence on the impact of mobile device use. The current study aimed to clarify the link between mobile device use and child adjustment. The sample included 1,642 children aged 6 in first grade at elementary schools in Japan. Parents completed a self-report questionnaire regarding their children's use of mobile devices and emotional/ behavioral adjustment. We performed inverse probability of treatment weighted (IPTW) logistic regression to compute odds ratios (OR) for emotional/behavioral problems according to mobile device use. The values for IPTW analysis were computed based on variables assessing sociodemographics and child characteristics. Among the participants, 230 (14.0%) were regular users (60 minutes or more on a typical day) and 1,412 (86.0%) non-regular users (under 60 minutes on a typical day). Relative to non-regular use, regular use of mobile devices was significantly linked to conduct problems (IPTW-OR: 1.77, 95% CI: [1.03 ± 3.04], p < .05) and hyperactivity/inattention (IPTW-OR: 1.82, 95% CI: [1.15 ± 2.87], p < .01). Based on these results, routine and frequent use of mobile devices appear to be associated with behavioral problems in childhood. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Deviant behavior of adolescents in the online world has emerged as a serious social issue in South Korea. Given the urgent need to address new forms of risks related to technological advancement such as the Internet, this study examined the mechanisms of online deviant behavior among adolescents guided by general strain theory. Two waves of the nationally representative Korean Children and Youth Panel Study (N = 2184; Mage = 13.6 years) were used. The study examines whether the association between parental maltreatment (7th grade) and online deviant behavior (8th grade) is mediated by depression (8th grade), and further whether the mediating effect of depression (8th grade) on online deviant behavior (8th grade) is moderated by mobile phone dependency (8th grade). Depression mediated the relationship between parental maltreatment and online deviant behavior in the following year. A significant indirect and negative effect of parental maltreatment on online deviant behavior through depression was observed when levels of mobile phone dependency were low and moderate but not when mobile phone dependency was high. The findings demonstrated that adolescent’s depression and mobile phone dependency represent a key mechanism in determining the association between parental maltreatment and online deviant behavior. However, these findings may not be applicable for youth with the highest levels of mobile phone dependency. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: Previous research on the beneficial effects of physical activity mostly focused on adult samples, although daily physical activity engagement is crucial for children's healthy development. The current study examines associations between preschool-aged children's physical activity, positive affect, and self-regulation during their everyday lives. Both direct and indirect associations between physical activity, positive affect, and self-regulation were investigated. Methods: For seven consecutive days, 98 children aged four to six years wore a tri-axial accelerometer (ActiGraph wGT3X-BT) to assess their moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). During this week, parents rated their children's daily positive affect and self-regulation every evening either by an online questionnaire or via a phone interview. Results: A multilevel structural equation model revealed direct positive associations between daily MVPA and positive affect (within-person level) and between positive affect and self-regulation (within- and between-person levels). There were no direct positive associations between MVPA and self-regulation (within- and between-person level); at the within-person level, a small, unexpected negative association between MVPA and emotional self-regulation was found. MVPA and self-regulation were indirectly related through positive affect on a daily basis. Conclusions: Engaging in more MVPA than usual on a given day was positively associated with preschoolers' daily positive affect, which was associated with higher daily self-regulation levels. Whereas physical activity seems to have short-term associations on a daily basis, positive affect seems to facilitate children's self-regulation skills both intra- and inter-individually.

AB  - Background: Most smokers attempting to quit relapse. There is little evidence whether the use of e-cigarettes (‘vaping’) increases or decreases relapse. This study aimed to assess 1) whether vaping predicted relapse among ex-smokers, and 2) among ex-smokers who vaped, whether vaping characteristics predicted relapse. Methods: Longitudinal web-based survey of smokers, recent ex-smokers and vapers in the UK, baseline in May/June 2016 (n = 3334), follow-up in September 2017 (n = 1720). Those abstinent from smoking ≥ 2 months at baseline and followed up were included. Aim 1: Relapse during follow-up was regressed onto baseline vaping status, age, gender, income, nicotine replacement therapy use and time quit smoking (n = 374). Aim 2: Relapse was regressed onto baseline vaping frequency, device type, nicotine strength and time quit smoking (n = 159). Results: Overall, 39.6% relapsed. Compared with never use (35.9%), past/ever (45.9%; adjOR = 1.13; 95% CI, 0.61–2.07) and daily vaping (34.5%; adjOR = 0.61; 95% CI, 0.61–1.89) had similar odds of relapse, for non-daily vaping evidence of increased relapse was inconclusive (65.0%; adjOR = 2.45; 95% CI, 0.85–7.08). Among vapers, non-daily vaping was associated with higher relapse than daily vaping (adjOR = 3.88; 95% CI, 1.10–13.62). Compared with modular devices (18.9% relapse), tank models (45.6%; adjOR = 3.63; 95% CI, 1.33–9.95) were associated with increased relapse; evidence was unclear for disposable/cartridge refillable devices (41.9%; adjOR = 2.83; 95% CI, 0.90–8.95). Nicotine strength had no clear association with relapse. Conclusion: Relapse to smoking is likely to be more common among ex-smokers vaping infrequently or using less advanced devices. Research into the effects of vaping on relapse needs to consider vaping characteristics. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The current study used Orlando, Florida as a case study, and investigated whether there are differences between the three meeting planner types (association, corporate, third party) in regard to destination selection attributes. The study further identified attributes that affect future bookings to Orlando. Data were collected from a nationwide survey of meeting planners with a usable sample of 2,388 completed phone surveys and 118 completed online questionnaires. One significant difference was found between the three meeting planner types. This research was performed in the midst of the recent recession and explored the impact the recession has had on planning meetings. Some effects of the economic downturn on the events industry are decreased attendance and more conservative budgets. Most association meeting planners did not cancel or postponed their events, although all planners agree that attendance to their meetings decreased. Third-party planners seemed to be the most sensitive to budget allocations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: To assess the performance of an active transcutaneous implantable-bone conduction device (TI-BCD), and to evaluate the benefit of device digital signal processing (DSP) features in challenging listening environments.Design: Participants were tested at 1- and 3-month post-activation of the TI-BCD. At each session, aided and unaided phoneme perception was assessed using the Ling-6 test. Speech reception thresholds (SRTs) and quality ratings of speech and music samples were collected in noisy and reverberant environments, with and without the DSP features. Self-assessment of the device performance was obtained using the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB) questionnaire.Study sample: Six adults with conductive or mixed hearing loss.Results: Average SRTs were 2.9 and 12.3 dB in low and high reverberation environments, respectively, which improved to −1.7 and 8.7 dB, respectively with the DSP features. In addition, speech quality ratings improved by 23 points with the DSP features when averaged across all environmental conditions. Improvement scores on APHAB scales revealed a statistically significant aided benefit.Conclusions: Noise and reverberation significantly impacted speech recognition performance and perceived sound quality. DSP features (directional microphone processing and adaptive noise reduction) significantly enhanced subjects’ performance in these challenging listening environments.

AB  - This eye-tracking study compared the usability of Yelp's Augmented Reality application Monocle with its familiar map-based app. Thirty participants (15 in each group) had to find a location in an outdoor mall using one version of the mobile Yelp app while wearing a pair of eye-tracking glasses that recorded the general area of the natural environment or smartphone their eyes focused on. Results showed that AR users could successfully arrive at the destination using the location-based technology that augments a visual display of the physical landscape with digital information. However, Augmented Reality users took longer to find the location than did map users. They also spent more time looking at the mobile smartphone and looked back and forth between the screen and the environment more often than map users. In open-ended questions about preference following the task, 14 of 15 in the AR group said they would likely use the Monocle app in the future to find a location because they could "see exactly" where something was or hated following directions. Since users successfully used this technology and reported enjoying its use, further development of AR for everyday use to complete tasks is encouraged. However, future studies should focus not only on the development of technology but its usability and employ visual communication theories such as Perception Theory (Barry, 2005) and Information Processing Theory (i.e., Krause, 1982) to help understand users' behavior.

AB  - Comprehension is the goal of reading. However, students often encounter reading difficulties due to the lack of background knowledge and proper reading strategy. Unfortunately, print text provides very limited assistance to one’s reading comprehension through its static knowledge representations such as symbols, charts, and graphs. Integrating digital materials and reading strategy into paper-based reading activities may bring opportunities for learners to make meaning of the print material. In this study, QR codes were adopted in association with mobile technology to deliver supplementary materials and questions to support students’ reading. QR codes were printed on paper prints to provide direct access to digital materials and scaffolded questions. Smartphones were used to scan the printed QR codes to fetch pre-designed digital resources and scaffolded questions over the Internet. A quasi-experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of direct access to the digital materials prepared by the instructor using QR codes and that of scaffolded questioning in improving students’ reading comprehension. The results suggested that direct access to digital resources using QR codes does not significantly influence students’ reading comprehension; however, the reading strategy of scaffolded questioning significantly improves students’ understanding about the text. The survey showed that most students agreed that the integrated print-and-digital-material- based learning system benefits English reading comprehension but may not be as efficient as expected. The implications of the findings shed light on future improvement of the system. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This article describes the development and implementation of a web-phone system to support care managers in delivering services to clients. The cloud-based system, called Teleherence, delivered a series of voice or text statements as well as questions that could accept responses from clients. Based on these responses the system branched to additional statements or questions or performed other tasks such as playing an audio file. The four Teleherence applications described point to the potentials and challenges of implementing new technology into existing services. Potentials were for more effective services especially with clients who had the time and capability to handle more extensive care management communications. Key challenges included integrating Teleherence into antiquated agency technology, the changes in work habits and policies required to handle increased care manager–client communications, including support for unstructured treatment communications and practices, protecting the security and privacy of client data and digital communications, agency staff turnover and reorganizations due to budget cuts, and developing a system using university resources in the context of rapid changes in mobile phone technology. This report suggests the road ahead in human services web-phone automation offers much potential, but is typically difficult, time consuming, and can substantially change how services are delivered.

AB  - Studies into the use of mobile applications (apps) for language learning have found positive results on language improvement and learner engagement, but they have mostly focused on small samples of learners using apps that were selected by a researcher/educator rather than on learners using apps of their own choice. This article presents the results of a large-scale survey (n = 4095) into the use of one of the most popular language learning apps in the market: the busuu mobile app (over 60 million registered users). Data were collected through an online questionnaire with 30 items. The survey was distributed both in English and in Spanish. The results provide a profile of busuu app users, show patterns of use, and what app features learners find most valuable for language learning. Most users are at beginner level and learn for personal interest. They find the app has helped them improve their knowledge of the language they are learning, with vocabulary as the main area of improvement. The high expectations from users and the fact that a third of respondents use busuu as their only language learning source suggest that a large proportion of users consider apps a reliable tool for language learning.

AB  - Introduction: In line with the European Union’s Tobacco Products Directive (TPD), new regulations for electronic cigarettes implemented in the United Kingdom between May 2016 and May 2017 included limiting refills to 10 mL, tank and cartridge sizes to 2 mL, and nicotine concentrations to 20 mg/mL. Aims: To investigate the (1) awareness of new regulations, (2) product use before and after implementation, and (3) association between use of compliant products and subsequent smoking. Methods: A UK online longitudinal survey of smokers, ex-smokers, and vapers was conducted between May and June 2016 (wave 4) and September 2017 (wave 5).The following methods were used: (1) to assess awareness of changes, proportions were calculated by smoking and vaping status (n = 1606). (2) Comparison of refill volume, tank and cartridge volumes, nicotine concentration at waves 4 and 5 (n = 199–388) was conducted. (3) Association was studied between number of TPD-compliant products used at wave 4 and smoking at wave 5, adjusted for wave 4 vaping status, age, gender, income, urges to smoke, and device type (n = 480). Results: Awareness of regulations was highest for refill volume (10.1%; 37.4% among exclusive vapers) and nicotine concentration (9.5%; 27.3%). Higher proportions used TPD-compliant refill volumes (60.0%–73.7%, χ²(1) = 10.9, p = .001) and nicotine concentrations (89.2%–93.9%, χ²(1) = 7.41, p = .007) in wave 5 than wave 4, with little change for tank or cartridge volumes (77.1–75.5%, χ²(1) = 0.38, p = .540). The likelihood of smoking was similar for those using no or one TPD-compliant products as it was for those using two (OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 0.47–2.59) or three (OR = 1.56, 95% CI = 0.69–3.55). Conclusion: Several months after full implementation, awareness of new regulations was low and most vapers used TPD-compliant products. Use of compliant products was not associated with subsequent smoking. Implications: Using a longitudinal survey at the beginning and a few months after the end of the transition period for implementation of new regulation on electronic cigarettes, this is the first study to assess awareness of regulation and use of compliant products. After full implementation, awareness of changes was low overall (smokers, ex-smokers, and vapers combined) although higher among those who vaped. Nevertheless, most vapers (74%–94%) used products that were compliant with the new regulations and the use of products compliant with incoming regulations did not predict whether they were smoking cigarettes after implementation.

AB  - With the increasing penetration of mobile phones and the internet in India, citizen journalism has experienced a steady growth in recent years. This paper adds to the growing scholarship on citizen journalism by exploring the motivations of Indian citizen journalists to produce online news content. Through a Web-based survey of citizen journalists (<italic>N</italic> = 134) contributing to the leading news portals in India, this study addresses the role of traditional media experience among citizen journalists’ reporting practices. One of the key findings of this study is that, unlike American citizen journalists, Indian citizen journalists who have not worked in traditional media are less likely to work collaboratively than those with traditional media experience.

AB  - Die Verfügbarkeit digitaler Medien ist in den letzten zehn Jahren sprunghaft angestiegen. Aufgrund eines Mangels an umfassenden Messinstrumenten geht dieses schnelle Wachstum des Zugangs zu digitalen Medien mit einem Mangel an Forschung einher, die den familiären Medienkontext und soziokognitive Ergebnisse untersucht. Es gibt auch wenig kulturübergreifende Forschung in Familien mit kleinen Kindern. Moderne Medien sind mobil, interaktiv und oft von kurzer Dauer, was es schwierig macht, sich an sie zu erinnern, wenn die Betreuungspersonen auf Umfragen zur Mediennutzung antworten. Das Comprehensive Assessment of Family Media Exposure (CAFE) Konsortium hat ein neuartiges Instrument entwickelt, um die Mediennutzung im Haushalt mittels eines webbasierten Fragebogens, eines Zeitnutzungstagebuchs und einer App zur passiven Erfassung, die auf den mobilen Geräten der Familie installiert ist, zu messen. Das Ziel der Entwicklung einer umfassenden Bewertung der Medienexposition von Familien war es, die Kontextfaktoren der Mediennutzung zu berücksichtigen und die Einschränkungen bestehender Selbstauskünfte zu verbessern, während gleichzeitig ein konsistentes, skalierbares und kosteneffektives Instrument geschaffen wurde. Das CAFE-Tool erfasst den Inhalt und den Kontext der frühen Medienexposition und adressiert die Grenzen bisheriger Medienmessansätze. Vorläufige Daten, die mit dieser Messung gesammelt wurden, wurden in eine gemeinsame Visualisierungsplattform integriert. In diesem perspektivischen Artikel verfolgen wir einen "tools-of-the-trade"-Ansatz (Oakes, 2010), um vier Herausforderungen zu beschreiben, die mit der Messung der Mediennutzung in Familien mit kleinen Kindern verbunden sind: die Messung von Einstellungen und Praktiken, die Erfassung von Inhalten und Kontext, die Messung kurzer Zeitspannen der Nutzung von Mobilgeräten und die Integration von Daten, um die Komplexität der Mediennutzung im Haushalt zu erfassen. Wir illustrieren, wie jede dieser Herausforderungen mit vorläufigen Daten, die mit dem CAFE-Tool gesammelt und auf unserem Dashboard visualisiert wurden, angegangen werden kann. Wir schließen mit einem Ausblick auf zukünftige Entwicklungen, einschließlich Plänen zur Prüfung der Zuverlässigkeit, Validität und Verallgemeinerbarkeit dieser Messungen. (translated by DeepL)
AB  - Digital media availability has surged over the past decade. Because of a lack of comprehensive measurement tools, this rapid growth in access to digital media is accompanied by a scarcity of research examining the family media context and sociocognitive outcomes. There is also little cross-cultural research in families with young children. Modern media are mobile, interactive, and often short in duration, making them difficult to remember when caregivers respond to surveys about media use. The Comprehensive Assessment of Family Media Exposure (CAFE) Consortium has developed a novel tool to measure household media use through a web-based questionnaire, time-use diary, and passive-sensing app installed on family mobile devices. The goal of developing a comprehensive assessment of family media exposure was to take into account the contextual factors of media use and improve upon the limitations of existing self-report measures, while creating a consistent, scalable, and cost-effective tool. The CAFE tool captures the content and context of early media exposure and addresses the limitations of prior media measurement approaches. Preliminary data collected using this measure have been integrated into a shared visualization platform. In this perspective article, we take a tools-of-the-trade approach (Oakes, 2010) to describe four challenges associated with measuring household media exposure in families with young children: measuring attitudes and practices; capturing content and context; measuring short bursts of mobile device usage; and integrating data to capture the complexity of household media usage. We illustrate how each of these challenges can be addressed with preliminary data collected with the CAFE tool and visualized on our dashboard. We conclude with future directions including plans to test reliability, validity, and generalizability of these measures.

AB  - Background: The 5As for smoking cessation is an evidence-based intervention to aid providers in counseling patients to quit smoking. While most providers 'ask' patients about their tobacco use patterns and 'advise' them to quit, fewer patients report being 'assessed' for their interest in quitting, and even fewer report subsequent 'assistance' in a quit attempt and having follow-up 'arranged'. Purpose: This article describes the design of an implementation study testing a computer tablet intervention to improve provider adherence to the 5As for smoking cessation. Findings will contribute to the existing literature on technology acceptance for addressing addictive behaviors, and how digital tools may facilitate the broader implementation of evidence-based behavioral counseling practices without adversely affecting clinical flow or patient care. Methods: This project develops and tests a computer-facilitated 5As (CF-5As) model that administers the 5As intervention to patients with a computer tablet, then prompts providers to reinforce next steps. During the development phase, 5As' content will be programmed onto computer tablets, alpha and beta-testing of the service delivery model will be done, and pre-intervention interview and questionnaire data will be collected from patients, providers, and clinic staff about 5As fidelity and technology adoption. During the program evaluation phase, a randomized controlled trial comparing a group who receives the CF-5As intervention to one that does not will be conducted to assess 5As fidelity. Using the technology acceptance model, a mixed methods study of contextual and human factors influencing both 5As and technology adoption will also be conducted. Conclusions: Technology is increasingly being used in clinical settings. A technological tool that connects patients, providers, and clinic staff to facilitate the promotion of behavioral interventions such as smoking cessation may provide an innovative platform through which to efficiently and effectively implement evidence-based practices.

AB  - Cycling is becoming one of the most popular forms of recreation and transport the world over, but cyclists still have a high level of vulnerability. A bicycle helmet is an important safety device available to cyclists, but little is known regarding possible determinants of helmet use among adults. This study aims at providing information on helmet usage patterns in Italy and identifying the factors associated with bicycle helmet use. Data on 2072 bicycle riders from an Italian friends of cycling association aged 18 years or older who had ridden a bicycle in the last month were collected using an ad-hoc questionnaire via the web. The sample was equally distributed among subjects who always, most of the time, sometimes, rarely, or never use a helmet. To evaluate the association among socio-demographic and bicycle use characteristics and helmet use, a multinomial logistic regression model was performed. The results show a higher propensity to use a helmet among males, riders coming from Central and Southern Italy, people who cycles more than 60kilometres in a week, cyclists who have already had a crash, people who do not cycle daily or almost daily, riders of sport bikes. Moreover, the propensity to use a helmet increases with age. The survey provided a first step in approaching the lack of data on cycling behaviour and the wearing of a helmet in Italy.

AB  - Social psychology studies how situations and interactions with others affect (often in subtle ways), a person's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. These behavioral, affective, and cognitive outcomes occur in a variety of social contexts with countless possible precursors found in the social environment. As a result of the topic diversity, social psychologists apply a broad array of metrics and use a great deal of creativity in translating hypotheses to a multitude of social contexts. Big data, a new form of data made possible by recent computational advances, has become increasing leveraged by social psychologists to help address existing questions in novel ways. This chapter largely focuses on this special category of newly available information from Web 2.0 Internet and related mobile technologies, which will subsequently be referred to as big data. It presents a categorization that organizes the most commonly used data into smaller overall groups. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the current clinical practice in approaches to bimodal programming in the United States. To be specific, if clinicians are recommending bimodal stimulation, who programs the hearing aid in the bimodal condition, and what method is used for programming the hearing aid? Method: An 11-question online survey was created and sent via email to a comprehensive list of cochlear implant programming centers in the United States. The survey was sent to 360 recipients. Results: Respondents in this study represented a diverse group of clinical settings (response rate: 26%). Results indicate little agreement about who programs the hearing aids, when they are programmed, and how they are programmed in the bimodal condition. Analysis of small versus large implant centers indicated small centers are less likely to add a device to the contralateral ear. Conclusions: Although a growing number of cochlear implant recipients choose to wear a hearing aid on the contralateral ear, there is inconsistency in the current clinical approach to bimodal programming. These survey results provide evidence of large variability in the current bimodal programming practices and indicate a need for more structured clinical recommendations and programming approaches.

AB  - Objective: Eating disorder recovery research has emphasized the absence of symptoms over the presence of adaptive aspects like positive body image and healthy eating attitudes. The current study examined how body appreciation and intuitive eating related to eating disorder recovery using a comprehensive recovery definition (physical, behavioral, and cognitive recovery). Method: Data were collected from 66 women with an eating disorder history and 31 controls with no history of eating pathology. Participants completed an online survey followed by a phone interview. Results: The fully recovered group did not differ from controls on body appreciation, with both groups endorsing significantly higher levels of body appreciation than the partially recovered and current eating disorder groups. Similarly, the fully recovered group did not differ from controls on overall intuitive eating, with both groups endorsing significantly higher levels of overall intuitive eating than the partially recovered and current eating disorder groups. Discussion: Positive psychological constructs such as body appreciation and intuitive eating relate to eating disorder recovery status. Understanding recovery within a strengths-based framework may inform intervention and relapse prevention. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Emerging evidence from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain activation studies associated with dietary behavior reveals significant interaction of biological and behavioral mechanisms in response to visualized food stimuli. Because food intake is influenced by neurosensory stimulation and memory cues, personalized food images may be useful in prompting appropriate affective responses to food intake, which may subsequently lead to healthier eating behaviors. The current study used a cross-sectional mixed methods approach to explore neural responses and self-perceptions of eating behavior during review of personalized food images. A sample of college students (N = 16; 9 females; M age = 21.44) used cell-phone cameras and an online dietary tracking website to collect and report three days of diet. Within 2–3 weeks of completing dietary tracking activity, participants underwent an fMRI scan while reviewing recorded personal images and text descriptions of their diet. They also responded to three questions related to memory for the food items and future eating intentions. Post-scan interviews explored how participants felt after reviewing personal food images and the possible impact that such review might have on future food choices. Whole brain analyses suggested, compared to a written dietary record, that the visualization of personal images of diet evoked greater brain activation in memory regions (e.g., superior frontal gyrus) along with mediating emotion (e.g., thalamus, putamen, anterior cingulate cortex), imagery and executive functions (e.g., inferior orbitofrontal gyrus, fusiform, and parietal lobe). This study offers preliminary support for the use of personal food images to strengthen dietary monitoring. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The present research attempted to develop a multidimensional brand trust scale and provide an alternative measurement model of brand trust. The proposed measurement model was tested with a set of data collected through a large-scale survey conducted by a professional research firm in China using the Central Location Test approach. The respondents consisted of 1,343 Chinese consumers who had adequate experience with the products we investigated. To reduce possible sample biases, respondents were recruited in multiple cities in different regions of China, including Beijing in the north, Shanghai in the middle, Guanzhou in the south, and Chengdo, an inland city in Sichuan Province. Six products were chosen to be tested in this study: detergent, beer, digital camera, laptop computer, car and wireless phone services. We chose to test the model with multiple products in the hope that the multidimensional scale would be applicable across product categories. The products were selected based on a pretest involving 88 students at a business school in Beijing. The instrument used in the main study contains the 12 items measuring brand trust and its two dimensions. The results have important implications. Because brand trust can be measured at different levels, researchers must be cautious in selecting a particular scale to use in the future. As discussed above, it is important to be clear about the level of trust in which one is interested since failure to distinguish measurement levels may impair measurement accuracy and cause model misspecification. For instance, it is not unusual to find measurement scales in marketing literature that contain both measures of overall trust and measures tapping into specific dimensions. The practice of using items indicating specific dimensions as direct measures of the construct of higher abstraction may create a problem of lack of unidimensionality if the final scale in fact taps into multiple content domains. Alternatively, it may result in a unidimensional construct with a content domain so restrictive that they actually measure a construct that is not of general interest.

AB  - Incorporating peer and professional social support features into remotely delivered, technology-supported physical activity interventions may increase their effectiveness. However, very little is known about survivors’ preferences for potential social features. This study explored breast cancer survivors’ preferences for both traditional (e.g., coaching calls and peer support) and innovative (i.e., message boards and competitions) social support features within remotely delivered, technology-supported physical activity interventions. Survivors [N = 96; Mage = 55.8 (SD = 10.2)] self-reported demographic and disease characteristics and physical activity. A subset (n = 28) completed semistructured phone interviews. Transcribed interviews were evaluated using a thematic content analysis approach and consensus review. Following interviews, the full sample self-reported preferences for social features for remotely delivered physical activity interventions via online questionnaires. Questionnaire data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Four themes emerged from interview data: (a) technology increases social connectedness; (b) interest in professional involvement/support; (c) connecting with similar survivors; and (d) apprehension regarding competitive social features. Quantitative data indicated that most survivors were interested in social features including a coach (77.1 per cent), team (66.7 per cent), and exercise buddy (57.3 per cent). Survivors endorsed sharing their activity data with their team (80.0 per cent) and buddy (76.6 per cent), but opinions were mixed regarding a progress board ranking their activity in relation to other participants’ progress. Survivors were interested in using a message board to share strategies to increase activity (74.5 per cent) and motivational comments (73.4 per cent). Social features are of overall interest to breast cancer survivors, yet preferences for specific social support features varied. Engaging survivors in developing and implementing remotely delivered, technology-supported social features may enhance their effectiveness.

AB  - Strategic, high quality HIV testing services (HTS) delivery is an essential step towards reaching the end of AIDS by 2030. We conducted HTS Data Use workshops in five African countries to increase data use for strategic program decision-making. Feedback was collected on the extent to which workshop skills and tools were applied in practice and to identify future capacity-building needs. We later conducted six semistructured phone interviews with workshop planning teams and sent a web-based survey to 92 past participants. The HTS Data Use workshops provided accessible tools that were readily learned by most respondents. While most respondents reported increased confidence in interpreting data and frequency of using such tools over time, planning team representatives indicated ongoing needs for more automated tools that can function across data systems. To achieve ambitious global HIV/AIDS targets, national decision makers may continue to seek tools and skill-building opportunities to monitor programs and identify opportunities to refine strategies.

AB  - The mobile communications industry is an important sector with European total revenues growing approximately 10 per cent per year and reaching 174 billion in 2007 (GSMA, 2008). Markets all over Europe are mature, and the operators engage in intense competition for customers. Heavy investments are made in marketing in order to gain new customers, whereas few efforts are made to retain the customers and build profitable long-term relationships (Ferguson and Brohaugh, 2008). The aim of this article is to outline the Portuguese mobile communications market from the relationship-marketing point of view, and to review the antecedents of customer-brand relationships. A web-based survey on a sample of 606 older Generation Y mobile communication users was conducted. Optimus, TMN and Vodafone are all implementing marketing strategies based on emotions. They are building customer databases to manage relationships with their corporate brand/company, but our results reveal that not all of them reach the same level of attitude towards their brand, reputation, tribalism or satisfaction with the brand. TMN, despite being the market leader, demonstrates a poor level of results in terms of customer-brand relationship building. On the basis of the findings of this research, implications for marketing practice and directions for further research are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Can digital devices enhance participation? Can the electronic ballot help trade unions in involving different categories of members in their decision-making processes and extend their representativeness? Trade union crisis is largely a legitimacy problem, as unions are representing mostly older and permanent workers. Simultaneously, the enthusiasm towards the internet as a mean to union revitalization seems to have waned somewhat. It was against this backdrop that we decided to conduct a survey of schoolteachers in Portugal and focus on the potential impact of a digital device to engage workers in union life. The survey sought to examines how the electronic ballot could be used as a tool to help decision-making, being aware of the different interests in play, and contributing to the increase of participation within trade unions. Our findings show negligible differences between teachers according to contractual status although non-unionized and precarious workers prove to be less receptive to the use of the electronic ballot.

AB  - The permeation of cell phone technology continues to alter human behavior by changing the way individuals communicate with both physically distant and co-present others. Despite their numerous communicative affordances, past research suggests potential negative effects when cell phones are over-used. Results from an online survey (N = 498) indicate that cell phone addiction was positively associated with experiences of anxiety. Anxiety, in turn, was negatively associated with willingness to engage in face-to-face communication. These findings suggest cell phones serve to improve communication with distant others while also posing a potential threat to the quality of communication with co-present others.

AB  - Smartphone use is ubiquitous, however, scholarly debate regarding the addictive nature of smartphones abounds. In this context, it is integral to distinguish between the content that users experience and the medium that facilitates access to the former, as users may experience addictive-like responses to the specific activities they engage in through the context experienced rather than the device that facilitates access to these activities. The present study aimed to explore conceptualizations of smartphone addiction by (a) investigating user preferences for specific smartphone functionalities, (b) examining behavioral changes associated with limited access to preferred functionalities, and (c) exploring links between aspects of smartphone use and self-reported psychological well-being. A total of 471 participants completed an online survey, providing data on sociodemographics, actual and hypothetical smartphone usage, and psychological well-being (depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms). The results showed that communication functionalities were most frequently cited as being preferred among smartphone users. Notably, participants reported that they would check their smartphones significantly fewer times if their top-three functionalities were inaccessible. This suggests that smartphone users are likely to become addicted to the functionalities they access on their smartphones (content) and not the smartphones themselves (medium), rendering unviable the notion of smartphone addiction as a construct. Further analyses suggested negligible to small correlations between aspects of smartphone use and psychological well-being variables. The findings imply that rather than focusing on frequency of smartphone use, it is recommended that future research examines the type and quality of specific smartphone usages and their effects on user well-being.

AB  - This paper examines channel choice and the digital divide in Egyptian electronic government or e-government. Citizens have access to a variety of service delivery channels when they initiate contact with their government, ranging from e-government to more traditional channels such as the phone and in-person visits to a government office. This paper examines the extent of use of both contact channels for citizens and the impact of the digital divide on channel use. A public opinion survey of Egyptian citizens was analyzed, and the results showed that there was a digital divide in the use of e-government by citizens. The digital divide also extended to other contact channels such as the phone and when citizens used multiple contact channels for public service delivery. The results of this study imply that for the development of e-government, especially in the context of a developing country such as Egypt, policy-makers need to understand that e-government is one of many channels that citizens can use when they initiate contact with their government. The results of this study should encourage policy-makers to recognize the importance of public service delivery in a multichannel environment.

AB  - This article analyses the modes of physical access that facilitate participation in digital opportunities and the development of digital skills in children and adolescents (9 to 17 years old). We analysed the data obtained from the Kids Online survey in Chile. A latent class analysis (LCA) was conducted to identify groups based on access points and devices of use; access modalities were then composed crossing these variables. Four access modalities were found: cellphone-home; cellphone-ubiquitous; multi-device-home; multi-device-ubiquitous. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that ubiquitous modalities (multi-device and cellphone varieties) predicted digital use and skills among young Chileans, while the more static modalities (cellphone and home and multi-device and home) did not. These results are critical to addressing what can be defined as 'enabling access' among young Internet users in the context of digital inclusion policies.

AB  - Background: Existing studies on the association between physical activity (PA), screen based time and sleeping show conflicting results. Objective: This study investigates the association between chronic pain at different body regions and self-reported PA, screen based time and sleeping hours in high school students. Subjects: A total of 969 students aged 13–19 years old. Methods: Participants completed a questionnaire on chronic pain, time spent in moderate and vigorous PA, screen based time watching television (TV)/digital versatile discs (DVD), playing, using mobile phones and computers and sleeping hours. Univariate and multivariate associations between pain and PA, screen based time and sleeping hours were investigated. Results: In the univariate model time spent in moderate and vigorous PA, in screen based activities and sleeping were associated with pain in at least one body site. In the multivariate model, screen based activities were not associated with pain; sleeping 7 h or less and increased time in moderate PA were associated with pain at almost all body sites [odds ratio (OR) between 2.69–3.66 and 1.06–1.10, respectively]. Conclusion: Time spent in PA and sleeping increased the risk of chronic pain in almost all body regions and might confound the association between screen based time and pain.

AB  - A generation of consumers have now grown up in the digital age, intimately connected to a host of digital tools. This generation, which we call Digital Natives, has become a prime target for mobile operators due to their size, spending power, and use intensity. In addition, they tend to be influential trend setters when it comes to the adoption of new digital solutions. In the dynamic emerging economy of Turkey, they are of even greater interest to mobile operators as they surpass their peers in many advanced economies in terms of use intensity. Despite its importance, our knowledge of the loyalty and churn behavior of this customer segment is very limited. We respond to this research gap by drawing insights from a comprehensive survey of digital natives in the Turkish context. The empirical data originates from a survey of 2000 Turkish university students. We employ Binomial Logistic Regression analysis which provides interesting managerial and public policy insights. Our findings demonstrate that such customer service factors as call quality, billing and brand image affect both the loyalty and churn intentions of Turkish Digital Natives. Surprisingly, youth loyalty club programs, duration of subscription, and prior churn experience are found to be not significant. These results lead to practical implications for mobile providers and telecom regulators operating in Turkey and elsewhere. • Turkish digital natives in this rapidly transforming economy represent a very active user group and also serve as opinion leaders in the telecom market. • The present study investigates those factors that shape the churn and loyalty decisions among Turkish digital natives in telecommunications sector. • The findings suggest that churn and loyalty intentions of Turkish digital natives are affected by customer service metrics, data usage, mobile operators, type of plan, and campaign awareness. • Moreover, previous churn experience and membership in loyalty programs do not appear to significantly impact dependent variables.

AB  - Mobile instant messenger (mIM) service providers are extending their online services to the offline platform. Asia's largest mIM service providers, LINE and Kakao, are brining life to its signature characters such that they appear not only on the text screen but also on offline character flagship stores. This study investigates mIM users' motives in visiting the store and identifies the role of mIM characters in facilitating users' loyalty toward the mIM service provider. To comprehensively understand users' motivations in visiting the offline flagship store, the study conducted a focus group interview and used the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to identify seven key motivations. The empirical findings are drawn from 332 Korean respondents that use the mIM service and have experience in visiting the character flagship store. The study finds that users who actively use mIM services and emoticons are likely to visit the store due to the identified factors. A virtuous cycle of loyalty from online to the offline platform, and vice versa was also found. Findings of this study confirm that mIM character flagship stores are a strategic way for mIM service providers to communicate with users and create their unique brand identity. • The purpose of this research is to investigate the loyalty intentions of mIM users that are attached to the character emoticons. • To draw the research questions, we reviewed previous studies including the construal level theory, parasocial interaction theory, the theory of uses and gratification, and loyalty theory. • We found that users who actively use mIM services and emoticons are likely to visit the store due to the identified factors. • This research findings confirm that parasocial interaction and users' close psychological distance with emoticons encourage users to remain attached and loyal to the emoticon and the mIM service provider.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to provide evidence regarding the comparability of results provided by two survey methods—a random phone survey and a nonrandom online survey—using the derived importance–performance approach to examine service satisfaction data at the local level. Specifically, we measure whether nonprobability opt-in online survey results produce results that are convergent or divergent to random phone survey results. The findings show that the phone and online survey techniques yield divergent results when simple univariate statistical techniques are employed but produce similar results when the data are analyzed using the more advanced derived importance approach. Though preliminary, the findings suggest that recent advances in the analysis of satisfaction survey data might have the possibility to offset the methodological drawbacks of nonrandom survey techniques such as opt-in online questionnaires. Because of the cost and resource implications of the use of each survey technique, the results hold potentially important lessons for researchers and administrators interested in understanding the costs and benefits of using various survey methods to assess satisfaction with municipal services.

AB  - This study draws on communication infrastructure theory (CIT) to examine the extent to which expressive uses of Internet and mobile devices moderate the relationship between integrated connectedness to a storytelling network (ICSN) and offline and online civic participation. Data collected through a Web survey of a U.S. national online panel ( N = 1201) reveal that the relationships of ICSN with offline and online civic participation are conditioned by locality-oriented expressive uses of Internet and mobile media. With these findings, this study discusses theoretical insights, policy implications, and practical applications. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This article compares Global Assessment of Function (GAF) and Client Satisfaction Survey scores for clients receiving either face-to-face or online counselling. Clients were assessed by phone and then assigned to one of the two modalities. Analyses of variance were conducted with α = 0.05, to examine differences between counselling modalities. No significant differences were found for degree of change in GAF between assessment and closing between the two modalities. Some differences were found in Client Satisfaction Scores. Implications for screening and social work practice are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background:Many factors affect an individual’s outcomes with a cochlear implant (CI); however, quality of device programming and consistency of follow-up appointments have been shown to be crucial contributors. As audiologists’ CI caseloads increase, time constraints on appointments also increase, thus fueling the need for efficient and effective programming strategies. Currently, there are no standardized guidelines describing what methods should be used during programming, nor are there standardized schedules that delineate what procedures should be performed at specific appointment intervals. Without standardized programming guidelines, clinical practices may be variable and may not align with best practice research; thus, outcomes with a CI, particularly for pediatrics, may not be reflective of the actual potential available. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to identify the clinical practice patterns used by U.S. audiologists when programming and providing follow-up care to children who use CIs. This study aimed to determine the following: common programming approaches, provision intervals for these procedures, common validation assessments, typical follow-up care schedules, and source(s) of CI training. In addition, this study sought to evaluate if training and/or follow-up care differed between small and large CI centers. Research Design: A cross-sectional survey design was used. Study Sample: Target population included practicing audiologists working with pediatric CI users throughout the United States. Participation was voluntary, thus random selection could not be used. A total of 167 participants opened and began the online survey and 113 successfully completed the survey instrument (23.99% return rate). Data Collection and Analysis: Potential participants were identified using the ‘‘find a clinic’’ function on three CI manufacturers’ websites. Potential participants were asked to complete an online survey seeking information about practices they employ in their clinical setting. Survey responses were analyzed for trends. Results: Overall, a common follow-up schedule was determined, which included an average of 6.8 appointments within the first year. Minor differences in training and programming practices between small and large CI centers emerged; however, no statistically significant results were noted. Results did reveal trends in the use of certain clinical practices. This was particularly evident in the limited use of objective measures. Conclusions: Overall, the findings support other recent studies that suggest the development of CI guidelines that may standardize programming and follow-up practices of CI audiologists. This could prove valuable for the continual improvement of CI outcomes, particularly in the pediatric population. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - A questionnaire-based study aimed to explore the link between Internet addiction, problematic mobile phone use and the occurrence of cognitive failures in daily life. Previous research has suggested that individuals who have lower working memory capacity (WMC) and poorer attentional control (AC) maybe poorer at limiting the distraction effect posed by access to communicative digital media such as the Internet and mobile phones (Unsworth, McMillan, Brewer, & Spillers, 2012). 210 participants completed an online questionnaire which comprised of the Online Cognition Scale (OCS; Davis, Flett, & Besser, 2002), the Problematic Mobile Phone Use Scale (MPPUS; Bianchi & Phillips, 2005) and the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ; Broadbent, Cooper, FitzGerald, & Parkes, 1982). Both the OCS and MPPUS were significantly positively correlated to scores on the CFQ. Further analysis revealed a significant difference between high and low scoring groups for both the MPPUS and the OCS and scores on the CFQ, with those in the higher groups presenting greater self reported cognitive failures. The results are interpreted as being symptomatic of individuals in the higher OCS and MPPUS groups as being less resilient to the distractions posed by digital media and technology with a suggested link to lower WMC and AC.

AB  - How did residents in Wuhan, who were at the epicenter of the initial COVID-19 outbreaks in China evaluate the risk to themselves and to society at large, and take action accordingly? This study examines the need for orientation, cognitive reasoning of COVID-19 news, and perceived risk, which all contributed to protective action during the city's total lockdown. Using data collected in a mobile CATI survey during the peak of the outbreaks in February 2020, findings show that the attention to COVID-19 in digital media predicted the perception of the coronavirus pandemic as a personal risk. In addition, the need for orientation and elaboration of news about the outbreaks were positively associated with perceived risk target – personal and societal. Finally, perceived personal risk proved a stronger predictor than perceived risk to society in general for taking protective behavior. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Navigate PD was an educational program established to supplement existing guidelines and provide recommendations on the management of Parkinson's disease (PD) refractory to oral/transdermal therapies. It involved 103 experts from 13 countries overseen by an International Steering Committee (ISC) of 13 movement disorder specialists. The ISC identified 71 clinical questions important for device-aided management of PD. Fifty-six experts responded to a web-based survey, rating 15 questions as ‘critically important;’ these were refined to 10 questions by the ISC to be addressed through available evidence and expert opinion. Draft guidance was presented at international/national meetings and revised based on feedback. Key take-home points are: 1. Patients requiring levodopa > 5 times daily who have severe, troublesome ‘off’ periods (> 1–2 h/day) despite optimal oral/transdermal levodopa or non-levodopa-based therapies should be referred for specialist assessment even if disease duration is < 4 years. 2. Cognitive decline related to non-motor fluctuations is an indication for device-aided therapies. If cognitive impairment is mild, use deep brain stimulation (DBS) with caution. For patients who have cognitive impairment or dementia, intrajejunal levodopa infusion is considered as both therapeutic and palliative in some countries. Falls are linked to cognitive decline and are likely to become more frequent with device-aided therapies. 3. Insufficient control of motor complications (or drug-resistant tremor in the case of DBS) are indications for device-aided therapies. Levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel infusions or subcutaneous apomorphine pump may be considered for patients aged > 70 years who have mild or moderate cognitive impairment, severe depression or other contraindications to DBS.

AB  - Despite the ubiquitous use of new communication technologies, gaps in our knowledge remain regarding who is likely to rely on particular technologies and potential ramifications of these forms of communication on individuals’ relationships and adjustment. In an online survey, 211 college students reported on their use of electronic communication with a parent who they identified as their closest family member. Results indicated that students who report more frequent phone conversations with parents also report more satisfying, intimate, and supportive parental relationships, but those students who use a social-networking site to communicate with parents report higher levels of loneliness, anxious attachment, as well as conflict within the parental relationship. The findings offer new evidence on how electronic communication technology with parents is related to adjustment in college students. Our study also suggests that further research is needed using longitudinal designs to understand better young adults’ use of technology to communicate in today’s society.

AB  - Technological advances in the information and knowledge society have influenced and transformed economic, social, and educational dynamics. Currently there are many digital gaps related to the access to technology, level of digital literacy, and social use. These gaps vary based on the age of the population and become more noticeable among elders. Digital illiteracy leads to the underusing of technological developments of the 21st century, making it difficult to take advantage of all the possibilities that they offer to our society. This study aims to analyze the level of penetration and use of handheld digital devices, especially the cellular phone, among the adult population. This study is based on the 2016 National Survey of Life Quality in Colombia, elaborated by Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadística-DANE, specifically on the module of ownership and use of ICT goods. Results of four age groups are compared, which include 32 year olds or under, from ages 33 to 45 years, 46 to 59 years, and over 60 years. The sample consists of 37047 inhabitants of the Colombian territory, grouped by regions (Antioquia, Bogota, Caribbean, Eastern Central, Orinoquia, Amazonia, Pacific, San Andres, and Valle del Cauca). Data have been analyzed by descriptive and inferential statistical procedures, contingency tables analyses, and logistic regression, in order to identify and know the effect of age on the level of penetration and use of handheld digital devices when comparing results in young adults and elderly people. Findings show that young adults use these technologies to a greater proportion when compared to older adults, showing a significant correlation between age and the increase of digital gaps in access and social use of handheld digital devices. Results also make evident that digital divide in Colombia may be associated to the place of residence, as people who live in rural zones are the ones who suffer greater from inequalities.

AB  - Whereas substance-use researchers have long combined self-report with objective measures of behavior and physiology inside the laboratory, developments in mobile/wearable electronic technology are increasingly allowing for the collection of both subjective and objective information in participants' daily lives. For self-report, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), as implemented on contemporary smartphones or personal digital assistants, can provide researchers with near-real-time information on participants' behavior and mood in their natural environments. Data from portable/wearable electronic sensors measuring participants' internal and external environments can be combined with EMA (e.g., by timestamps recorded on questionnaires) to provide objective information useful in determining the momentary context of behavior and mood and/or validating participants' self-reports. Here, we review three objective ambulatory monitoring techniques that have been combined with EMA, with a focus on detecting drug use and/or measuring the behavioral or physiological correlates of mental events (i.e., emotions, cognitions): (1) collection and processing of biological samples in the field to measure drug use or participants' physiological activity (e.g., hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity); (2) global positioning system (GPS) location information to link environmental characteristics (disorder/disadvantage, retail drug outlets) to drug use and affect; (3) ambulatory electronic physiological monitoring (e.g., electrocardiography) to detect drug use and mental events, as advances in machine learning algorithms make it possible to distinguish target changes from confounds (e.g., physical activity). Finally, we consider several other mobile/wearable technologies that hold promise to be combined with EMA, as well as potential challenges faced by researchers working with multiple mobile/wearable technologies simultaneously in the field.

AB  - Die zunehmende Prävalenz intelligenter mobiler Geräte (z.B. Smartphones) ermöglicht die kombinierte Nutzung von Mobile Crowdsensing (MCS) und ökologischen Momentanbewertungen (EMA) im Gesundheitsbereich. Durch die Korrelation von qualitativen longitudinalen und ökologisch validen EMA-Bewertungsdatensätzen mit Sensormessungen in mobilen Apps können neue wertvolle Erkenntnisse über Patienten (z.B. Menschen, die an chronischen Krankheiten leiden) gewonnen werden. Allerdings gibt es zahlreiche konzeptionelle, architektonische und technische, sowie rechtliche Herausforderungen bei der Implementierung einer entsprechenden Softwarelösung. Daher identifiziert die vorliegende Arbeit (1) diese Herausforderungen, (2) leitet entsprechende Empfehlungen ab und (3) schlägt eine Referenzarchitektur für eine MCS-EMA-Plattform vor, die die definierten Empfehlungen berücksichtigt. Die erforderlichen Erkenntnisse, um die Referenzarchitektur vorzuschlagen, wurden in mehreren groß angelegten mHealth-Crowdsensing-Studien gewonnen, die seit vielen Jahren und zu verschiedenen Fragen der Gesundheitsversorgung durchgeführt werden. Um nur zwei Beispiele zu nennen: Wir führen Crowdsensing-Studien zu Fragen im Zusammenhang mit der chronischen Tinnitus-Erkrankung oder psychischem Stress durch. Wir betrachten die vorgeschlagene Referenzarchitektur und die identifizierten Herausforderungen und Empfehlungen als einen Beitrag in zweierlei Hinsicht. Erstens ermöglichen sie es anderen Forschern, unsere praktischen Studien an einer Ausgangssituation auszurichten, die die verschiedenen aufgedeckten Einsichten befriedigen kann. Zweitens sind sie eine geeignete Grundlage für einen besseren Vergleich von Daten, die mit MCS und EMA erhoben wurden. Darüber hinaus erfordert der kombinierte Einsatz von MCS und EMA zunehmend geeignete Architekturen und damit verbundene digitale Lösungen für den Gesundheitsbereich. (translated by DeepL)
AB  - The increasing prevalence of smart mobile devices (e.g., smartphones) enables the combined use of mobile crowdsensing (MCS) and ecological momentary assessments (EMA) in the healthcare domain. By correlating qualitative longitudinal and ecologically valid EMA assessment data sets with sensor measurements in mobile apps, new valuable insights about patients (e.g., humans who suffer from chronic diseases) can be gained. However, there are numerous conceptual, architectural and technical, as well as legal challenges when implementing a respective software solution. Therefore, the work at hand (1) identifies these challenges, (2) derives respective recommendations, and (3) proposes a reference architecture for a MCS-EMA-platform addressing the defined recommendations. The required insights to propose the reference architecture were gained in several large-scale mHealth crowdsensing studies running for many years and different healthcare questions. To mention only two examples, we are running crowdsensing studies on questions for the tinnitus chronic disorder or psychological stress. We consider the proposed reference architecture and the identified challenges and recommendations as a contribution in two respects. First, they enable other researchers to align our practical studies with a baseline setting that can satisfy the variously revealed insights. Second, they are a proper basis to better compare data that was gathered using MCS and EMA. In addition, the combined use of MCS and EMA increasingly requires suitable architectures and associated digital solutions for the healthcare domain.

AB  - This study examines teleworkers’ job satisfaction related to the use of and satisfaction with a variety of communication channels and workers’ personality type. U.S. teleworkers (N = 384) completed an online survey and self-reported on dimensions of communication channel satisfaction, job satisfaction, and personality. Results indicated that extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness are positively correlated with job satisfaction. Additionally, significant moderating effects were found for the relationship between openness and phone and video communication, and agreeableness and phone communication on job satisfaction. Findings from this study yield important practical implications for organizations including suggestions for optimizing communication satisfaction for employees of differing personality types and recommendations to help organizations effectively hire and retain teleworkers.

AB  - This study proposes and tests a communication mediation model that examines the potential influence of instant messenger (IM) apps on cognitive biases and political participation among users. Data from a national online panel of U.S. adults provide insights into how egocentric assumptions in public opinion perceptions that stem from mobile echo chambers can contribute to a user's participatory behaviors, which further highlights the role of IM in politics as a private, closed mode of political communication.

AB  - This research explores the design, implementation, and evaluation of a prototype augmented reality application that assists operators in performing procedural tasks in control room settings. Our prototype uses a tablet display to supplement an operator’s natural view of existing control panel elements with sequences of interactive visual and attention guiding cues. An experiment, conducted using a nuclear power plant simulator, examined university students completing both standard and emergency operating procedures. The augmented reality condition was compared against two other conditions – a paper-based procedure condition using paper manuals and a computer-based procedure condition using digital procedures presented on a desktop display. The results demonstrated that the augmented reality -based procedure system had benefits in terms of reduced mental workload in comparison to the other two conditions. Regarding task completion time, accuracy, and situation awareness, the augmented reality condition had no significant difference when compared against the computer-based procedure condition but performed better than the paper-based procedure condition. It was also found that the augmented reality condition resulted in fewer intra-team inquiry communication exchanges in comparison to both paper-based and computer-based conditions. The augmented reality condition, however, yielded poorer memory retention score when assessed against the other two conditions. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In many countries, the proportion of the population using cell phones is higher than that with Internet access. Cell phone and Internet penetration rates are high in most university populations. Despite the recent attention focused on surveys of cell phone users, and the preference for using the Internet to survey university students, there have been few studies comparing cell phone surveys and Web surveys of the student population. This article reports on a mode of experiment conducted using an annual survey of students at a large university in South Korea. The frame of registered students contains both cell phone numbers and e-mail addresses. A sample of students was selected from the list and randomly assigned to a computer-assisted telephone interviewing or Web survey mode. Students were notified of the survey in both modes using both text messaging and e-mail messages. We find that the cell phone survey has an advantage over the Web survey in terms of response rates, coverage of key domains, and item nonresponse. Substantive differences between the two modes were found for about half the survey questions. This suggests that cell phone surveys may be useful for surveys in populations with universal or near-universal coverage, and where cell use may be more popular than Internet use.

AB  - Much research has been done comparing grids and item-by-item formats. However, the results are mixed, and more research is needed especially when a significant proportion of respondents answer using smartphones. In this study, we implemented an experiment with seven groups (n = 1,476), varying the device used (PC or smartphone), the presentation of the questions (grids, item-by-item vertical, item-by-item horizontal), and, in the case of smartphones only, the visibility of the 'next' button (always visible or only visible at the end of the page, after scrolling down). The survey was conducted by the Netquest online fieldwork company in Spain in 2016. We examined several outcomes for three sets of questions, which are related to respondent behavior (completion time, lost focus, answer changes, and screen orientation) and data quality (item missing data, non-substantive responses, instructional manipulation check failure, and nondifferentiation). The most striking difference found is for the placement of the next button in the smartphone item-by-item conditions: When the button is always visible, item missing data are substantially higher.

AB  - The article presents a study which compared the response rates and completion times of two onsite electronic survey distribution methods: an all onsite tablet-based survey versus a hybrid approach (tablet-based onsite short version with a subsequent online follow-up). A survey was developed to examine visitor perceptions of climate change impacts at three natural areas in Columbia, Missouri; their beliefs and attitudes about climate change; and their level of support to minimize the impacts of climate change. . This study compared the relative effectiveness of two electronic survey approaches. Response rates and completion times showed that the all-onsite survey was more efficient than using a hybrid approach. This study examined the relative effectiveness of the two electronic survey approaches. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - With the growing popularity of smartphones and tablet PCs (tablets) equipped with mobile browsers, the possibilities to administer surveys via mobile devices have expanded. To investigate the possible mode effect on answer behavior, results are compared between a mobile device–assisted web survey and a computer-assisted web survey. First, a premeasurement in the CentERpanel is conducted to analyze the user group of mobile devices. Second, the users are randomly allocated one of the three conditions: (1) conventional computer-assisted web survey, (2) hybrid version: a computer-assisted web survey with a layout similar to mobile web survey, and (3) mobile web survey. Special attention is given to the design of the mobile web questionnaire, taking small screen size, and typical functionalities for touchscreens into account. The findings suggest that survey completion on mobile devices need not lead to different results than on computers, but one should be prepared for a lower response rate and longer survey completion time. Further, the study offers considerations for researchers on survey satisfaction, location during survey completion, and preferred device to access Internet. With adaptations, surveys can be conducted on the newest mobile devices, although new challenges are emerging and further research is called for.

AB  - The dramatic rise of smartphones has profound implications for survey research. Namely, can smartphones become a viable and comparable device for self-administered surveys? The current study is based on approximately 1,500 online U.S. panelists who were smartphone users and who were randomly assigned to the mobile app or online computer mode of a survey. Within the survey, we embedded several experiments that had been previously tested in other modes (mail, PC web, mobile web). First, we test whether responses in the mobile app survey are sensitive to particular experimental manipulations as they are in other modes. Second, we test whether responses collected in the mobile app survey are similar to those collected in the online computer survey. Our mobile survey experiments show that mobile survey responses are sensitive to the presentation of frequency scales and the size of open-ended text boxes, as are responses in other survey modes. Examining responses across modes, we find very limited evidence for mode effects between mobile app and PC web survey administrations. This may open the possibility for multimode (mobile and online computer) surveys, assuming that certain survey design recommendations for mobile surveys are used consistently in both modes.

AB  - Abstract: This paper studies the relationship between competitive strategy and improvement in the competitive position of pioneers and followers in the mobile telecommunications industry. The analysis uses a panel of data comprising all the actions of European firms operating in the digital mobile telecommunications industry with GSM 900 and/or DCS 1800 networks. The results show that competitors gain market share when they follow competitive strategies that are different from those of other firms. The paper also finds that price reduction actions represent the best approach for followers, while differentiation actions are the most effective strategy for pioneers. [Copyright &y& Elsevier]

AB  - Developed and implemented a new system that utilizes the P300 pattern to compose music. The P300 event-related potential is a well-known pattern in the electroencephalogram (EEG). This kind of brain signal is used for many different brain-computer interface (BCI) applications, e.g., spellers, environmental controllers, web browsers, or for painting. In recent times, BCI systems are mature enough to leave the laboratories to be used by the end-users, namely severely disabled people. Therefore, new challenges arise and the systems should be implemented and evaluated according to user-centered design (USD) guidelines. The developed Brain Composing system consists of three parts: the EEG acquisition device, the P300-based BCI, and the music composing software. 17 musical participants and one professional composer performed a copy-spelling, a copy-composing, and a free-composing task with the system. The efficiency, effectiveness, and subjective criteria were investigated in terms of satisfaction, enjoyment, frustration, and attractiveness according to the USD guidelines. Measures included visual analogue scales, the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX), and the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ). Results showed that the musical participants group achieved high average accuracies: 88.24% (copy-spelling), 88.58% (copy-composing), and 76.51% (free-composing). The professional composer also achieved high accuracies: 100% (copy-spelling), 93.62% (copy-composing), and 98.20% (free-composing). General results regarding the subjective criteria evaluation were that the participants enjoyed the usage of the Brain Composing system and were highly satisfied with the system. Showing very positive results with healthy people in this study, this was the first step towards a music composing system for severely disabled people.

AB  - Background: Routine monitoring of depression symptoms and suicide risk is essential for appropriate treatment planning and risk management, but not well implemented by clinicians. We developed a brief online monitoring tool to address this issue. Aims: To investigate whether the online tool can feasibly improve monitoring; whether it is acceptable and useful for young people and their clinicians; and to determine whether a shorter tool could be implemented. Method: In a naturalistic longitudinal cohort study, 101 young people with depression completed the online tool on a tablet, prior to their consultation. Their results were immediately available to their clinician. Clients and clinicians answered questionnaires about acceptability and usefulness. Results: The tool was feasible to implement. Young people and clinicians found the tool acceptable and useful for understanding symptoms and risk. A brief three-item suicidal ideation screening measure correlated well with a validated measure of suicidal ideation. Conclusion: The online tool facilitates the quick exchange of key information about suicide risk, allowing clinicians to immediately address this. This level of responsiveness is likely to improve treatment outcomes. The brief version allows full integration into clinical practice to support clinicians managing those at risk of suicide.

AB  - The study examined the use of computer-mediated communication (CMC) among individuals involved in a conflict sparked by the appointment of an administrator as president-designate of Gallaudet University in 2006. CMC was defined as forms of communication used for transmitting (sharing) information through networks with digital devices. There were 662 survey respondents. Respondents reported overwhelmingly (98%) that they used CMC to communicate. Students and alumni reported CMC use in larger proportions than any other group. The favorite devices among all respondents were Sidekicks, stationary computers, and laptops. Half of all respondents also reported using some form of video device. Nearly all reported using e-mail; respondents also identified Web surfing, text messaging, and blogging as popular CMC activities. The authors plan another article reporting on computer and electronic technology use as a mechanism connecting collective identity to social movements. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Incorporation of tablet computers (TCs) into patient assessment may facilitate safe and secure data collection. We evaluated the usefulness and acceptability of a TC as an electronic self-report symptom assessment instrument. Research Electronic Data Capture Web-based application supported data capture. Information was collected and disseminated in real time and a structured format. Completed questionnaires were printed and given to the physician before the patient visit. Most participants completed the survey without assistance. Completion rate was 100%. The median global quality of life was high for all. More than half reported pain. Based on Edmonton Symptom Assessment System, the top 3 most common symptoms were tiredness, anxiety, and decreased well-being. Patient and physician acceptability for these quick and useful TC-based surveys was excellent. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - One of my intentions in putting together the roundtable discussion From the Page to the Screen to Augmented Reality: New Modes of Language-Driven Technology-Mediated Research at Kingston University in July 2010 was to give the opportunity to research practitioners to perform their projects or present their work, with the aim of stimulating discussion on practice-led research in this field and instigating possibilities for further collaborations. I performed Connected Memories, an interactive generative narrative, which I produced especially after the proposal had been selected to be presented at the panel in Interactive Storytelling and Memory Building in Post-conflict Society for the International Symposium on Electronic Art (ISEA 2009). I invited José Carlos Silvestre to develop the technical side of the work. Silvestre is a New Media artist and writer, interested in 'how code can signify by means of its native strategies'. It was a very rewarding collaboration, and he needs to be acknowledged for his knowledgeable programming input. The project was performed later in the same year at Landmark, Kunsthall Bergen, Norway as part of the event 'Network as Space and Medium for collaborative Interdisciplinary Art Practice' organized by the Linguistic Literary and Aesthetics Studies (LLE) Digital Culture group at the University of Bergen. I chose to present it again at the roundtable discussion to question, through practice as research; notions of meaning production in digital textuality; the double view of linguistic signifiers and visual-language abstract landscapes; the use of technology as a device to collect and share stories; the programming of non-linear interactive narrative structures and storytelling through the performance of the work; and the use of code to perform generative textualities. These themes will be reviewed in this article by presenting the motivations behind the work, concepts, context, research process and technological concerns. My overall research draws from concrete, visual and experimental poetics, art, linguistics and new media art, as does this work. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In the conventional classroom, many obstacles hinder interaction between an instructor and students, such as limited class hours, fixed seating, and inadequate time for meetings after class. This work develops a novel multimedia mobile classroom feedback system (MMCFS) that instantly displays students’ responses, such as class-related questions or answers to questions on a quiz, on the instructor’s computer. This system reinforces interaction between instructors and students and improves learning efficiency. Its features are as follows: 1) automatic attendance checking; 2) in-class real-time evaluation; 3) improved willingness of students to raise questions; 4) immediate grade enquiring; 5) cross-platform functionality; 6) a virtual mobile classroom; 7) data integrity; 8) low construction cost; 9) group learning; and 10) learning process recording. This system uses a client-server and three-tiered architecture models as its framework. When a class is in progress, the instructor only requires a notebook computer with a web browser, while students need a mobile phone or equivalent mobile devices with built-in Java Platform, Micro Edition (J2ME) and wireless support. A web server and the rear-end database can be located outside the classroom when network connections are available. Attendance checking, conducting quizzes, instant question inquiring, and grade inquiring are the four primary functions of the system. A questionnaire is applied to evaluate system’s interactivity, mobility, and functionality. The 105 subjects comprised two classes of undergraduate students. The questionnaire addresses interactivity, mobility, and functionality. Its purpose was to compare the proposed system and the interactive response system (IRS). Experimental results show that the proposed system has superior interactivity, mobility, and functionality. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This exploratory online questionnaire-based study confirms the findings from earlier studies in the pre-smart phone era regarding consumers’ negative attitudes towards mobile marketing communications. This study shows that these attitudes persist despite increasing frequency of use and increased functionality of mobile phones in the smart phone era. Consumers perceive their mobile device to be for personal communication, and prefer to be able to exercise control over their interaction with organisations. Findings suggest that acceptance can be enhanced by permission marketing, trust-building, creating a sense of being in control, and useful and entertaining website content. Accordingly, pull technologies seem to hold particular promise for mobile marketing communications. This study, therefore, proceeds to explore use of and attitudes towards an important pull technology, QR codes. QR codes, two-dimensional bar codes, can be scanned to provide access to websites, information and applications. Despite their potential, uptake is low. Users in this study who had scanned a QR code had used them to access a variety of different content on different types of items and in different locations. The most frequently accessed type of content was information on a web site, the two most common locations for a scanned QR code were a newspaper or magazine advert, or outdoor advert or poster, and the two most common locations at which scanning was performed were in the street and at home. Ease of use, utility and incentives are drivers to continued use whilst lack of knowledge about how-to scan or of the benefits of QR codes may hinder adoption. Recommendations are offered for practice and for further research. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Digital provide consists of electronic media, telecommunications, and computer technologies – information and communication technologies (ICTs) availability, accessibility, and utilisation, which simplifies process. The convergence of ICTs ensures efficiency in resources allocation and promotes system growth. This study examines the convergence in global information and communication technologies (ICT) development for 205 countries spanning 2000–2018. We employ the Phillips and Sul econometric methodology, which tests for the existence of convergence clubs and the modelling of different transition paths to convergence. We further disaggregated our panel data into nine regions. We constructed an ICT development index (comprising of mobile line, fixed line, and internet access penetration) via principal component analysis. Our findings suggest the presence of panel convergence at the global and regional levels (except for Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, which exhibited divergence). However, we identified convergence clubs using an iterative testing procedure. The key findings from the club convergence algorithm results suggest that: (i) at the global level, club 1 converges; (ii) at regional levels, Sub-Saharan Africa forms 7 clubs; (iii) clubs 1 in the remaining 8 regions converged. Contrary to previous findings, this study finds that the process of convergence in ICT development reflects the desirable emanations of telecommunication policies sharing similar characteristics, at least to some extent, in terms of the ICT sharing across the globe. • There is conditional convergence of ICT at global level, while regional levels differ. • The countries at global and regional levels exhibited both transition paths above 1 and those below 1 at some point. • Policies should focus more on idiosyncratic regional factors of the divergent regions.

AB  - Recently a number of studies appeared that operationalised coolness and explored its relation to digital products. Literature suggests that perceived coolness is another factor of user experience, and this adds to an existing explosion of dimensions related to aesthetics, hedonic quality, pragmatic quality, attractiveness, etc. A critical challenge highlighted in prior research is to study the relationships among those factors and so far, no studies have empirically examined the relationship between coolness and other established user experience factors. In this paper, we address this challenge by presenting two studies one that focuses on factors from two cool questionnaires, and one that compares them against existing User eXperience (UX) factors. Our findings show that factors from the two cool questionnaires converge and they also converge to existing, established UX factors. Thus, 11 distinct cool and UX factors converge into 5 for the case of mobile devices. Our findings are important for researchers, as we demonstrate through a validated model that coolness is part of UX research, as well as for practitioners, by developing a questionnaire that can reliably measure both perceived inner and outer coolness as well as the overall coolness judgement based on 5 factors and 21 items.

AB  - The production and distribution of news is changing. At the same time, the relationship between journalism and artificial intelligence systems is becoming stronger. Within this context, conversational bots have appeared, which are software applications that distribute personalised content (Al Johri et al., 2016) through social networks, online instant messaging apps, and mobile devices. This research presents a case study on the conversational political news bot known as Politibot, which is a pioneering, successful Spanish project that emerged during the 2016 election campaign. The study analyses users' perceptions of the bot as a news and conversational tool based on their experience of use. An experimental methodology has been used in combination with other qualitative and quantitative research techniques (documentary analysis, direct observation, registration forms, as well as pre-test and post-test by means of questionnaires). The results show widespread acceptance in terms of reliability, comprehension, and the format regarding the information received from the bot, as well as its immediacy and customisation. However, the possibility of interacting with bots is still limited, which is also true of the case under study herein. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2019-20543-001[/rid]). The Autism impact measure (AIM) is a caregiver-reported questionnaire assessing autism symptom frequency and impact in children, previously shown to have good test–retest reliability, convergent validity and structural validity. This study extended previous work by exploring the AIM’s ability to discriminate between ‘known-groups’ of children, and estimating thresholds for clinically important responses. Data were collected online and electronically on computer and mobile devices; hence, it was also possible to confirm other psychometric properties of the AIM in this format. This study provides confirmatory and additional psychometric validation of the AIM. The AIM offers a valid, quick and inexpensive method for caregivers to report core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) including communication deficits, difficulties with social interactions and repetitive behaviors.

AB  - Purpose: This study investigates the neck/shoulder pain (NSP) and low back pain (LBP) among current high school students in Shanghai and explores the relationship between these pains and their possible influences, including digital products, physical activity, and psychological status. Methods: An anonymous self-assessment was administered to 3,600 students across 30 high schools in Shanghai. This questionnaire examined the prevalence of NSP and LBP and the level of physical activity as well as the use of mobile phones, personal computers (PC) and tablet computers (Tablet). The CES-D (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression) scale was also included in the survey. The survey data were analyzed using the chi-square test, univariate logistic analyses and a multivariate logistic regression model. Results: Three thousand sixteen valid questionnaires were received including 1,460 (48.41%) from male respondents and 1,556 (51.59%) from female respondents. The high school students in this study showed NSP and LBP rates of 40.8% and 33.1%, respectively, and the prevalence of both influenced by the student’s grade, use of digital products, and mental status; these factors affected the rates of NSP and LBP to varying degrees. The multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that Gender, grade, soreness after exercise, PC using habits, tablet use, sitting time after school and academic stress entered the final model of NSP, while the final model of LBP consisted of gender, grade, soreness after exercise, PC using habits, mobile phone use, sitting time after school, academic stress and CES-D score. Conclusions: High school students in Shanghai showed high prevalence of NSP and LBP that were closely related to multiple factors. Appropriate interventions should be implemented to reduce the occurrences of NSP and LBP. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Motorcyclist safety is a major concern in many developing countries. Understanding motorcycle riders’ risky behaviours, particularly among the younger population, is essential to developing effective interventions. This paper explores the correlations between mobile phone use while riding and other risky riding behaviours as well as the relationships between perceived risks and risky riding behaviours, using an online survey of university students in Vietnam. Results show that calling while riding a motorcycle had the highest prevalence (74%) while reckless overtaking had the lowest prevalence (33.2%). Survey participants who indicated that they had the behaviours of reckless overtaking or riding on sidewalks were around twice as likely to call, text, or search for information while riding. In addition, those who admitted that they rode a motorcycle while under the influence of alcohol were nearly twice as likely to call or text while riding. The results also show that perceived crash risks reduced the likelihood of risky riding behaviours, including calling, texting, searching for information, speeding, running red lights, riding on the wrong side of a road, and riding on sidewalks. A more coordinated approach to enforcement is needed to help reduce the prevalence of multiple risk taking behaviours among motorcyclists. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In this study, the researcher aimed to develop a mobile‐assisted learning system and to investigate whether it could promote teenage learners' classical Chinese learning through the flipped classroom approach. The researcher first proposed the structure of the Cross‐device Mobile‐Assisted Classical Chinese (CMACC) system according to the pilot survey and reviewed literature, and then adopted a quasi‐experimental design to understand whether the developed system could promote and support flipped classroom learning for classical Chinese. A total of 56 eleventh graders from two classes participated in the experiment. The learners in the experimental group learned classical Chinese with the flipped classroom learning strategy with the assistance of the CMACC system, while the control group adopted the flipped classroom learning strategy without using the CMACC system. The results reveal that all of the students improved their Chinese performance, but it was noticeable that the learners who used the CMACC system showed better motivation in terms of self‐directed preview learning, while those who only learned with the traditional textbooks tended to be more passive. In sum, the mobile‐assisted learning system added value in providing learners with opportunities to achieve anytime and anywhere flipped classroom learning. The integration of ubiquitous mobile learning technology and the flipped classroom strategy can be viewed as a critical factor leading to students achieving self‐regulated learning. It is also suggested that instructors should carefully take the targeted learners' cultural background and the availability of supporting learning devices into consideration so as to prevent the flipped classroom from exacerbating the digital divide. Other suggestions for educators and instructional designers are also proposed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Online crowdwork platforms have been praised as powerful vehicles for economic development, particularly for workers traditionally excluded from the labor market. However, there has been insufficient scrutiny as to the feasibility of crowdwork as an income-source among socioeconomically deprived populations. This article examines device requirements and differential access to digital infrastructure, both of which act as potential barriers to not only basic participation but also to economic success online. Given the increasing prevalence of mobile-first and mobile-only populations, research on this topic aids in understanding the crowdwork ecosystem among differing socioeconomic sectors. Based on a survey of 606 crowd workers across the United States and India, this article uses both quantitative and qualitative data to explore whether reliance on mobile devices is detrimental for economic outcomes of crowdwork. The results point to substantial inequalities in device use and received benefits from crowdwork, within each country and between the two contexts. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Context: Previous research has indicated that despite awareness of the current literature on the recommended prevention and care of exertional heat stroke (EHS), certified athletic trainers (ATs) acknowledge failure to follow those recommendations. Objective: To investigate the current knowledge, attitudes, and practices of ATs regarding the recognition and treatment of EHS. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Online survey. Patients or Other Participants: We obtained a random sample of e-mail addresses for 1000 high school and collegiate ATs and contacted these individuals with invitations to participate. A total of 498 usable responses were received, for a 25% response rate. Main Outcome Measure(s): The survey instrument evaluated ATs' knowledge and actual practice regarding EHS and included 29 closed-ended Likert scale questions (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree), 2 closed-ended questions rated on a Likert scale (1 = lowest value, 9 = greatest value), 8 open-ended questions, and 7 demographic questions. We focused on the open-ended and demographic questions. Results: Although most ATs (77.1%) have read the current National Athletic Trainers' Association position statement on heat illness, only 18.6% used rectal thermometers to assess core body temperature to recognize EHS, and 49.7% used cold-water immersion to treat EHS. Athletic trainers perceived rectal thermometers as the most valid temperature assessment device when compared with other assessment devices (P ≤ .05), but they used oral thermometers as the primary assessment tool (49.1%). They identified cold-water immersion as the best cooling method (P ≤ .05), even though they used other means to cool a majority of the time (50.3%). Conclusions: The ATs surveyed have sound knowledge of the correct means of EHS recognition and treatment. However, a significant portion of these ATs reported using temperature assessment devices that are invalid with athletes exercising in the heat. Furthermore, they reported using cooling treatment methods that have inferior cooling rates. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Informed by the social orientation of loyalty, the study extends the current body of knowledge by integrating multiple relationship layers (i.e., personal loyalty, relationship with online consumption communities and local network effects) as antecedents of various states of firm‐customer interactions including habitual loyalty, fanaticism, and retaliation. Data collection was carried out in the mobile telecommunications market using a paper‐based survey. A total of 600 completed survey responses were collected. The respondents were 18 or older and had been mobile service users for at least 1 year. Overall, it was found that personal loyalty, relationship with online consumption communities and local network effects were significant antecedents of fanaticism. Personal loyalty and local network effects can reinforce habitual loyalty whereas the relationship with online consumption communities can increase retaliation. The role of relationship with online consumption communities becomes more significant as customers perceive a higher level of indifference among service providers. Further, local network effects were significantly and negatively related to retaliation. The findings of this study provide important theoretical and practical implications for academics and practitioners alike, especially in the contractual, network industries.

AB  - The current study examines cyberbullying and victimization among African American college students who spend large amounts of time on the Internet and using their smartphones. In a survey of 321 African American college students, the most common venues for victimization occurred through text messages, phone calls, and social networking sites. Posting indiscreet images and sharing personal information with a large number of Facebook friends were positively associated with the victimization. Cyberbullying perpetration, as measured by Cyberbullying Questionnaire (CBQ), revealed a significant gender difference, with male students exhibiting higher prevalence. In a multiple regression analysis, the phenomenon of online disinhibition—a lessening of inhibitions during online interactions that would otherwise be present in face-to-face interactions—emerged as the strongest predictor of cyberbullying perpetration. Recommendations for future research include studying the negative impact of cyberbullying among African American adults, particularly in the workplace.

AB  - Android 5 informs users of all permissions requested when downloading an app and gives users an all-or-nothing acceptance decision to make for the permissions. In contrast, Android 6 informs users of each permission upon first use of the downloaded app. We conducted an online study with participants recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk to compare the relative usability of the two permissions interfaces. Each interface condition contained a simulation of the Google Play Store and instructed participants to role-play the task of downloading an app. Afterward, each participant was questioned about which permissions were seen and the functions of those permissions. The Android 5 interface showed better performance with informing users as to which permissions access their device, whereas the Android 6 interface fared better with presenting the functions of the permissions. Also, the Android 6 interface was found to be more intuitive to use than that of Android 5. Although a pilot study showed that users favored the Android 6 permissions interface over Android 5’s, the present study found no clear evidence that it was more effective than Android 5.

AB  - Context Online harassment and stalking have been identified with growing accordance as anti-social behaviours, potentially with extreme consequences including indirect or direct physical injury, emotional distress and/or financial loss. Objective As part of our ongoing work to research and establish better understanding of cyberstalking, this study aims to investigate the role of Police, Mobile Operators, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and owners/administrators of online platforms (e.g. websites, chatrooms) in terms of intervention in response to offences. We ask to what different authorities do people report incidents of cyberstalking? Do these authorities provide satisfactory responses or interventions? And how can this be improved? Furthermore, we discuss the role of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) to encourage the implementation of cyberstalking-aware schemes by service providers to support victims. In addition, CSR can be used as a means to measure the effects of externality factor in dictating the relationship between the impact of a given individuals’ privacy loss and strategic decisions on investment to security controls in an organisational context. Method A mixed method design has been used in this study. Data collection took place by means of an online survey made available for three years to record both qualitative and quantitative data. Overall, 305 participants responded from which 274 identified themselves as victims of online harassment. Result Our results suggest that most offences were communicated through private channels such as emails and/or mobile texts/calls. A significant number of victims did not report this to their service provider because they did not know they could. While Police were recognised as the first-point-of-contact in such cases, 41.6% of our sample did not contact the Police due to reasons such as fear of escalation, guilt/sympathy and self-blaming. Experiences from those who have reported offences to service providers demonstrate that no or very little support was offered. Overall, the majority of participants shared the view that third-party intervention is required on their behalf in order to mitigate risks associated with cyberstalking. An independent specialist anti-stalking organisation was a popular choice to act on their behalf followed by the Police and network providers. Conclusion Incidents are taking place on channels owned and controlled by large, cross-border international companies providing mobile services, webmail and social networking. The lack of support offered to victims in many cases of cyberstalking can be identified as Corporate Social Irresponsibility (CSI). We anticipate that awareness should be raised as regarding service providers’ liability and social responsibility towards adopting better strategies. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Studies point to a relationship between fantasy sports/daily fantasy sports (DFS) play and gambling behavior. However, little is known about the nature of those relationships, particularly regarding the development of gambling problems. This study investigates the nature, frequency, and preferences of gambling behavior as well as problem gambling severity and comorbid conditions among DFS players. Data were collected from an epidemiologic survey of 3634 New Jersey residents on gambling and leisure activities. Participants were contacted by phone (land-line and cell) and online to obtain a representative, cross-sectional sample of non-institutionalized adults, aged 18 years or older. Excluding non-gamblers, the remaining 2146 participants, included in these analyses, indicated they had either played DFS (n = 299) or had gambled but not played DFS (1847) in the past year. Univariate comparisons and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the most significant characteristics and predictors of DFS players. Overall, a higher number of gambling activities, high frequency gambling, male gender, and reports of suicidal thoughts in the past year were most predictive of DFS players. Being Hispanic (vs. Caucasian) and/or single (vs. married or living with a partner) also doubled the odds of DFS play. Findings suggest that DFS players are characterized by high gambling frequency and problem severity and comorbid problems, notably suicidal ideation. Future research should examine the motivations and possible etiological sub-types of DFS players and the nature and course of DFS play, particularly in relation to gambling behavior and the development of gambling and other problems.

AB  - The considerable growth in the number of smart mobile devices with a fast Internet connection provides new challenges for survey researchers. In this article, I compare the data quality between two survey modes: self-administered web surveys conducted via personal computer and those conducted via mobile phones. Data quality is compared based on five indicators: (a) completion rates, (b) response order effects, (c) social desirability, (d) non-substantive responses, and (e) length of open answers. I hypothesized that mobile web surveys would result in lower completion rates, stronger response order effects, and less elaborate answers to open-ended questions. No difference was expected in the level of reporting in sensitive items and in the rate of non-substantive responses. To test the assumptions, an experiment with two survey modes was conducted using a volunteer online access panel in Russia. As expected, mobile web was associated with a lower completion rate, shorter length of open answers, and similar level of socially undesirable and non-substantive responses. However, no stronger primacy effects in mobile web survey mode were found. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - With increasingly digitization, more and more information is collected from individuals and organizations, leading to several privacy concerns. These risks are further heightened in the mobile realm as data collection can occur continuously and ubiquitously. When individuals use their own devices in work settings, these issues become concerns for organization as well. The question then is how to ensure individuals perform proper information protection behaviors on mobile devices. In this research, we develop a model of mobile information protection based on an integration of the Theory of Planned Behavior and the information privacy literature to explore the antecedents of the attitude of individuals towards sharing information on their mobile devices, their intentions to use protective settings, and their actual practices. The model is tested with data from 228 iPhone users. The results indicate that mobile information protection intention leads to actual privacy settings practice, and that attitude towards information sharing and mobile privacy protection self-efficacy affect this intention. Determinants of attitude towards information sharing include mobile privacy concern and trust of the mobile platform. Finally, prior invasion experience is related to privacy concern. These findings provide insights into factors that can be targeted to enhance individuals’ protective actions to limit the amount of digital information they share via their smartphones.

AB  - Rationale: As therapeutic interventions are being developed utilising telehealth and mobile phones, it is important to understand how substance‐dependent individuals will respond to offers of online assistance. Objectives: The present paper considered the following: (1) how decision‐making style is associated with use and dependence upon commonly used stimulants and (2) how it influences behavioural responses to electronic offers of further information about these drugs. Method: An online survey examined patterns of nicotine and caffeine use, administered Severity of Dependence Scales for caffeine and nicotine and assessed decision‐making style using the Melbourne Decision Making Questionnaire and mood using the Kessler Distress Scale. Upon completing these scales, the 181 participants with a mean age of 28.14 years were offered further information online. Results: Stimulant dependence was associated with psychological distress. Caffeine dependence was linked to hypervigilance (panic). Decisional self‐esteem varied with stimulant dependence and Kessler Distress Scale score. Participants with high decisional self‐esteem declined electronic offers of further information. Conclusion: Confidence rather than defensive avoidance was a factor in reducing information‐seeking behaviours on the Internet. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Modern technology allows for surveying through different media (e.g. Internet, mobile phones, tablets), which may influence the quality of collected data with additional effects due to the survey mode and should be pretested with the purpose of avoiding effects that would deteriorate the quality of collected data. In the present study, we analysed the technological development of surveying tools by testing the applicability of cognitive interviews on several different survey modes. We focused on the importance of the cognitive interviewer and the effect of reducing their degree of involvement on the quality of the interview results. We carried out personal interviews, interviews using voice-over-Internet protocol, interviews using programs for instant messaging, and web-based interviews; these enabled us to analyse the quality of each survey mode and recognize their advantages and deficiencies. Through the comparison of these modes and their assigned technique, we showed that the role of a cognitive interviewer is important for the quality of interviews regardless of the degree of their involvement in the survey process. However, the requirement for the pretesting situation to resemble the actual final process leads to a necessity to develop new, enhanced approaches to cognitive interviewing on trending survey modes.

AB  - Delivering reliable and high-capacity Internet connectivity to high-speed train users is a challenge. Modern railway cars act as Faraday cages, and a typical train comprises several hundreds of users moving at high velocity. Furthermore, with the global availability of 4G LTE, user expectations have dramatically increased: it is expected to be online anytime and anywhere. Demand for high-capacity mobile is being driven by video and music streaming services, for lower latency and higher availability by gaming, and for more reliability and even uplink capacity by mission-critical applications. Finally, the life cycle of the railway industry is much longer than for telecommunications, which makes supporting 5G challenging. In this article, we survey the challenges associated with delivering high-capacity connectivity to train users, describe potential options, and highlight how a leading western European operator is tackling these challenges and preparing for 5G and beyond.

AB  - Text messaging has emerged as a potentially useful tool to help smokers quit. This paper evaluates smokers' preferences for the Quittext program, which examines the feasibility and acceptability of delivering tailored smoking cessation advice via mobile phone text messaging. Thirty smokers completed a web‐based smoking behavior questionnaire and received 6 weeks of tailored text messages. Feedback was obtained via questionnaires and semistructured interviews. Smokers reported a preference for positive support, tailoring message content, and the ability to interact with the system. Delivering quitting advice by text message was considered feasible and acceptable. This research contributes to the literature; however, further intervention evaluation is warranted, with larger controlled studies needed to fully assess program feasibility and its effect on quit rates.

AB  - Background: Electronic platform surveys are ideal for self-administration in adolescent populations, as nearly all adolescents in the US report using or having access to smartphones. This technology-savvy population seems prepared to graduate away from paper surveys. Despite predicted advantages of using smartphones for data collection, there is a surprising lack of data regarding the use of this mode for surveillance of substance use trends among adolescent populations. Objectives: The objective of this study was to evaluate completion rates, times, and responses of high school students taking the Secondary Student Life Survey: Nevada (SSLS:NV) on their own personal smartphones compared to provided computers or tablets. Methods: The SSLS:NV is a web-based survey designed to assess adolescent beliefs, attitudes, and use-trends surrounding substance use. The SSLS:NV was self-administered via self-selected device (personal vs. provided) within one class period to approximately one thousand 9th–12th grade students in December 2016. Data was collected and analyzed to compare outcomes by computer, tablet, or smartphone. Statistical analysis was performed in SPSS 23.0 using χ² or Fisher’s exact test for categorical data and one-way ANOVA for continuous data. Results: SSLS:NV completion times averaged 21 min overall (p = .193). Differences were seen with completion rates of 86% smartphone 94% tablet, and 95% computer (p < .001), while responses to lifetime substance use were similar across all groups. Conclusions/Importance: The current study provides proof of concept that personal smartphones are effective in achieving more comprehensive adolescent substance use surveillance within a relatively short amount of time, while retaining robust response rates.

AB  - Objectives: We described and evaluated the 2009–2010 Pennsylvania Influenza Sentinel School Monitoring System, a voluntary sentinel network of schools that report data on school absenteeism and visits to the school nurse for influenza-like illness (ILI). Methods: Participating schools provided daily absenteeism and ILI data on a weekly basis through an online survey. We used participation and weekly response rates to determine acceptability, timeliness, and simplicity. We assessed representativeness by comparing participating schools with nonparticipating schools. We compared monitoring system data with statewide reports of laboratory-confirmed influenza. Results: Of the 3244 Pennsylvania public schools, 367 (11%) enrolled in the system. On average, 79% of enrolled schools completed the survey each week. Although the peak week of elevated absenteeism coincided with the peak of statewide laboratory-confirmed influenza cases, the correlation between absenteeism and state data was nonsignificant (correlation coefficient = 0.10; P = .56). Trends in ILI correlated significantly with state data (correlation coefficient = 0.67; P < .001). Conclusions: The school-based sentinel system is a simple, acceptable, reliable device for tracking absenteeism and ILI in schools. Further analyses are necessary to determine the comparative value of this system and other influenza surveillance systems. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This paper’s premise is that technology has the potential to support the elicitation, expression and communication of positive thoughts. However, its success depends on understanding and incorporating appropriate strategies for interactive system design and development. Following in the positive psychology tradition, this paper presents two co-design studies investigating how positive thoughts can be mediated and shared. These studies involved approximately 50 participants, using paper-based questioning techniques and social–online tools that captured 151 contributions on what thoughts people like to share. The collected data demonstrated the potential for designing systems based on a prefixbased elicitation of positive emotions. Analysis of participants’ contributions suggests that various messages of a predominantly positive nature can be harnessed, emphasizing the importance of immediacy and situatedness in expression. Moreover, the analysis resulted in a set of design considerations for the design and development of positive expressive technologies. These considerations were used to develop a mobile application called PosiPost Me (Mobile Internet Edition) that allows users to create and share positive thoughts at any time and place. In this way, this research sets an exemplar of a design process for positive communicative systems while building on research in positive psychology, human–computer interaction and cognitive ergonomics. Relevance to industry: The studies conducted showed the feasibility of proposed approach and opens new avenues for technologies aimed at positive communication and wellbeing in the mobile environment. It also offers a set of design considerations to support designers in creating such positive expressive technologies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study addresses why Japanese teenagers participate in mobilebased word-of-mouth (WOM) campaigns. It is posited that commitment to the promoted brand, relationship with the mobile device, and group–person connectivity act as antecedents of two primary gratifications of the campaign, entertainment value and purposive value, which in turn determine the direction and strength of the attitude–intention–behavior chain. A “real” mobile campaign was used as stimulus. Based on a random sampling method, 22,500 structured questionnaires were sent to young consumers, 13–18 years old, via mobile device. Our data fit the proposed model fairly well, and all hypothesized paths are supported. There are significant differences in the strength of the paths between teenagers who learned of the campaign from non-WOM sources (i.e., content-based Web sites and e-mail magazines) versus WOM sources (pass-along e-mail and direct referral). In closing, theoretical and managerial implications are discussed and important limitations are recognized. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Authentic videos are always motivational for foreign language learners. According to the findings of many empirical studies, subtitled L2 videos are particularly useful for foreign language learning. Although there are many authentic English videos available on the Internet, most of these videos do not have subtitles. If subtitles can be added to videos, EFL students might better understand the video content and pick up more vocabulary items. To help EFL students make better use of authentic videos, an automatic video and transcript synchronization system called SynctoLearn was developed. The SynctoLearn system uses speech recognition technologies to automatically synchronize voices in audios and videos with their respective transcripts. Two studies were conducted in order to assess the effectiveness of this listening tool and investigate EFL learners’ perception toward this device. In the first study, two college classes at similar proficiency levels were divided in two groups. One group viewed the synchronized video and another viewed the same video without any synchronized subtitles. The group that watched the synchronized video outperformed the other group in summarizing the key points of the video. In the second study, two college EFL classes used the SynctoLearn website for a whole semester and were invited to fill in a questionnaire. Based on the survey results, students indicated that they enjoyed watching synchronized videos. They regarded the design of the SynctoLearn system positively and particularly lauded the options that allowed them to click and replay any video segments and show/hide the subtitles at any time. Students, however, suggested that the video quality and subtitle presentation can be further improved. Moreover, additional learning support such as online dictionaries can be included in the system. The results of the experiment and the survey indicate that the SynctoLearn tool, which provides synchronized subtitles, can be used as a supporting tool to help EFL students reduce their cognitive loads and anxiety levels when tackling authentic videos. The findings and the technologies used in this article should be useful for teachers and researchers who want to use or develop similar tools for foreign language learning.

AB  - Abstract: This study examines the question of whether the geographical digital divide in China has reduced with the introduction of mobile, including 3G, telecommunications. Geographical digital divide is measured primarily by teledensity at the provincial level. Changes of the geographical digital divide over time are analyzed within the framework of hardware, software, and other factors. Following this analytical framework, mobile or wireless telecommunications has higher potential of equipping the poor and narrowing the digital divide, especially in developing countries. In terms of hardware, the installation cost of wireless technology is often lower than fixed-line telephone services, especially in remote rural areas and/or areas of difficult terrains. The hardware required by users, notably mobile handsets, is also cheaper to own than personal computers (PCs). In terms of software, a greater variety and more flexible packages are often offered for mobile telecommunication services, and most applications on mobile phones are simpler and more user-friendly. Moreover, the requirements of mobile technologies on some other key factors known to affect information and communication technology (ICT) adoption rates are also lower. In particular, the requirements for language, especially English, proficiency and computer literacy are lower. Furthermore, proactive government measures have been implemented in China to narrow the digital divide through supportive policies influencing the factors named above. Under these circumstances, the well-known association between economic growth and widening digital divide (a difficult dilemma faced by governments of most developing countries) has been reversed in China after 2005.

AB  - This study adds to the literature on computer-mediated communication (CMC) by examining the impact of online voice recording (VR) activities and peer-to-peer videoconferencing (VC) conversations on the development of beginning Spanish learners’ speaking performance. Specifically, this paper explores (1) whether VR and VC activities promote oral proficiency, and if so, whether those gains can be seen both in presentational and interpersonal modes of communication; and (2) whether VR and VC activities foster oral proficiency in similar ways to face-to-face (F2F) communication. A quasi-experimental, pre-/post-test design was used in the study. Three sections of a first semester Spanish course were assigned to one of the following conditions: F2F, VR, and VC. Complexity, accuracy, and fluency measures were used to analyze learners’ speaking performance in the two tasks. A mixed effects model analysis was used to investigate differences across time as well as among groups. Results show that both F2F communication and VR activities promote complexity and fluency in presentational tasks and fluency in interpersonal tasks, although F2F produces superior results regarding complexity in presentational tasks. VC activities promote complexity and fluency in presentational tasks and complexity, accuracy, and fluency in interpersonal tasks. Overall, this study shows that medium is not merely a delivery device but has important implications for learning outcomes. In this sense, these findings contribute to answering the wider question of how the use of technology in second language instruction plays a decisive role in current teaching practices.

AB  - Objective: To outline the development and evaluation of an online infertility peer supporter training program. Methods: Men and women with diverse infertility backgrounds were recruited and trained to provide online peer support to people undergoing fertility treatment. Training required volunteers to (1) read a peer support training manual, (2) watch a webinar, and (3) complete practice questions, each of which was evidence-based and reviewed by key stakeholders. Results: Seventeen women and one man were trained and provided online peer support. Program satisfaction was high and training materials were rated as helpful. Peer supporters felt comfortable providing support and having their discussions monitored. They liked helping others and the convenience of a mobile application. Conclusion: Online recruitment and training of infertility peer supporters is feasible. The current program was acceptable and offers steps for improving future online peer support interventions. Practice implications: Current evidence supports the acceptability and feasibility of this training and supervision program, and provides service providers with information guiding its development and implementation.

AB  - Although a number of instruments have been used to measure Internet skills in nationally representative surveys, there are several challenges with the measures available: incompleteness and over-simplification, conceptual ambiguity, and the use of self-reports. Here, we aim to overcome these challenges by developing a set of reliable measures for use in research, practice, and policy evaluations based on a strong conceptual framework. To achieve this goal, we carried out a literature review of skills-related studies to develop the initial Internet skills framework and associated instrument. After the development of this instrument, we used a three-fold approach to test the validity and reliability of the latent skill constructs and the corresponding items. The first step consisted of cognitive interviews held in both the UK and the Netherlands. Based on the cognitive interview results, we made several amendments to the proposed skill items to improve clarity. The second step consisted of a pilot survey of digital skills, both in the UK and in the Netherlands. During the final step, we examined the consistency of the five Internet skill scales and their characteristics when measured in a representative sample survey of Dutch Internet users. The result is a theoretical, empirically and cross-nationally consistent instrument consisting of five types of Internet skills: operational, navigation information, social, creative, and mobile.

AB  - SMS language is regarded as a 'new' communication system (cf. T. Shortis 2007; D. Crystal 2009; M. Markus 2010) characterized by new relationships that native speakers establish between English spelling and pronunciation by using different respelling devices (cf. C. Thurlow 2003; P. López Rüa 2007; D. Crystal 2009). This paper is an attempt to contribute to this recent area of study by analysing the development of SMS language over the last 10 years. Recent findings suggest that even though SMS language might have emerged out of the need for speed and brevity (C. Thurlow 2003:4) - every SMS has a limited amount of characters -, it seems to have evolved into a fashionable and stylish way of writing where shortened versions of the words are not always the aim of the respelling. For the purpose of a diachronic analysis a free online British SMS corpus available at netting-it.com containing 201 text messages compiled in 2000 has been used in comparison with my own data obtained in May 2010 by means of questionnaires carried out in a London secondary school. Thus, it was possible to analyse the differences in the use of SMS language during the last decade. The research proves that one of the most significant changes is the use of 'stylish talk' a new device which consists in lengthening words to emphasize accent, slang, and attitude. This contrasts with the general belief that words are merely shortened in SMS language. Moreover, the use of slang and ungrammatical expressions also seem to be frequent devices.

AB  - Introduction: Electronic cigarette (e-cig) device characteristics affect use but few studies have evaluated the types of devices commonly used or how users transition between devices. This study examines e-cig device usage patterns and explores the relationship between device transitions and continued use. Methods: E-cig users completed an online survey from 2012 to 2015 about their e-cig use, preferred device, and preferences and were followed-up via an emailed survey in January 2017. Continuing users were those reporting any e-cig use in the past 30 days at both time points while stoppers reported no use at follow-up. Means, frequencies, and Chi-square tests were used as appropriate to describe the sample, the transition between devices, and differences between groups. Results: The sample was 83.6% (n = 511) continuers and 16.3% (n = 100) stoppers. At follow-up, most continuers had transitioned to using more advanced devices like mods (62.6%) with variable voltage (67.7%) and/or wattage (76.8%) and with a tank system (78.6%). Nicotine concentration decreased by half from baseline to follow-up (p < .01). Baseline cigalike users were the most likely to report stopping e-cig use (p < .01) and the most likely to return to other tobacco use (p = .02). Conclusion: The majority of e-cig users continued exclusive e-cig use over 3 + years and were likely to transition to devices with more advanced characteristics like variable voltage and to reduce the nicotine concentration of their liquid. Baseline cigalike users were the most likely to stop e-cig use at follow-up. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study should be considered as a preliminary exploration of the effect of differential incentives on participation rates, the proportion of mobile respondents, and sample composition in web surveys. The experiment has some limitations, which should be taken into consideration in subsequent studies. First, the experiment is based on a sample of frequent mobile web users, and the results could be different from a sample of those who use mobile internet less frequently. Second, the experiment is based on a volunteer online access panel and the results could be different in a representative online panel. Third, we tested the differential incentives starting with incentives 50% higher than typical incentives. We suggest that it is worth exploring the effect of other incentives (e.g. 20% or 30% higher). Finally, we suggest that it is worth exploring the difference in participation rates between the conditions in which higher-than-typical incentives would be offered for all participants and when offered only for using a particular device.

AB  - This paper studies the similarities and differences among the views of school principals and teachers regarding a mobile computer lab (MCL) initiative implemented in 1,591 public schools in Chile. It also characterizes the aspects in which their views diverge. A mixed methods study was carried out in two stages: first, a quantitative stage, where a self-administered (web-based) questionnaire was sent to the schools; and second, a qualitative stage, where a case study was conducted with three schools. The results show a greater convergence of the teachers’ and school principals’ views regarding the contribution of ICT resources to teaching, with more divergence when it comes to the implementation process. More specifically, these differences were related to two points: (1) how appropriate the conditions were for using and learning how to use the new resources within the context of the school, and (2) who should be held accountable for integrating ICT resources within the school organization. Furthermore, the qualitative results revealed that school principals only had vague information on the pedagogical integration of the MCLs in their schools. These findings suggest that in order to have more effective technology integration processes in schools, a closer presence of school leaders in the teachers’ everyday pedagogical activities is required.

AB  - As mobile devices have become increasingly commonplace, concerns have been raised by the media about the use of such technology by children and young people. Some media coverage has included concerns about children not getting enough sleep due to late night phone use and even the dangers associated with inattention when crossing roads. However, the primary concern has centered on the impact that the growing use of text messaging could have on language itself and children’s language development in particular. For example, suggestions have been made that the use of abbreviations and alternative spellings, which are a feature of communication via text and instant messaging, ultimately pose a threat to children’s spelling and grammatical development. Such assertions have not been made tentatively; rather, they have been asserted as inevitable truths, despite the lack of evidence at the time to support such strong claims. However, our own work and that of others working in this field have not supported these concerns and have in fact either shown positive or null associations between the use of texting slang and literacy development. The question of why there has been little evidence of any detrimental impact is one that we have explored in our papers. However, there is scope to understand further the findings we obtained in these studies if we consider the proposition that the linguistic forms that many children use when writing in digital contexts represent a type of 'efficient' orthographic system.

AB  - This study explored the social repercussions of preadolescents' mobile device use within the family context by testing two opposing predictions regarding the impact of technology on the quality of interpersonal relationships. Specifically, we examined whether smartphone and tablet use was positively related to preadolescents' self-disclosure to their parents and/or displaced family time, which we hypothesized to be related to children's satisfaction with family life. Results of a cross-sectional survey (n = 698, 49.6% girls, Mage= 10.9, SD = 0.69) provided support for both hypotheses, thus corroborating the presence of at least two diverging pathways that underlie this relationship. Although mobile device use seemed to foster a context that supported children's self-disclosure to their parents, results also indicated a negative and indirect association through children's perceived family time. This negative pathway, however, did not hold when social use among children and parents (e.g. playing games together online) was considered separately. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Given the rapid rise of mobile-only users, we investigated the digital inclusion process through smartphones. By using Chile as a case study, a country that has strongly promoted mobile connections to address internet access gaps, we compared mobile-only and computer users in different dimensions of the digital inclusion process, including digital skills and differentiated uses of the web. By relying on a face-to-face national representative survey, the results showed that smartphones represent an opportunity to access the internet for those who traditionally lag behind. However mobile-only use does not necessarily lead to a more complete digital inclusion process because it was related to lower levels of skills and less diverse types of uses of the web compared to those people who also use the computer. Also, skills partially mediated the association between access device and types of uses of the web, which suggests that the differences by access device partly occur because people have greater chances to develop skills when accessing the web through computers.

AB  - Aims: The COVID-19 pandemic forced closure of most U.S. university campuses in March 2020, obliging millions of students to finish their semesters via remote learning. This study examines whether and how students’ prior and current experiences of digital inequality—defined as constrained access to the internet and internet-connecting devices—were associated with their remote learning experiences. Method: An anonymous, online survey of 2,913 undergraduate college students from 30 U.S. universities completing their spring term remotely was conducted between April and May 2020. Hypothesis testing utilized a structural equation model with cluster-bootstrapped standard errors and p-values, to account for students being clustered by university. Results: Findings revealed that students’ challenges with internet connectivity and digital devices during remote learning were associated with lower remote learning proficiency (RLP). Difficulty communicating with professors and teaching assistants was also associated with lower RLP. Prior experience with online coursework was associated with higher RLP, and digital inequality challenges during the year prior to the pandemic with lower RLP. Moreover, students who reported greater financial hardship since the start of the pandemic experienced significantly more connectivity, device, and faculty communication challenges during remote learning, and had significantly lower RLP. Conclusions: Many students will continue to learn remotely in some form until the pandemic recedes. We identify key factors associated with students’ remote learning proficiency: (1) consistent, high-speed internet connectivity and functioning devices to connect to it, and (2) the ability to relate to and communicate easily with professors and teaching assistants. This study identifies potential barriers to effective remote learning, as well as possible opportunities to improve students’ experiences. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Although digital media are widely recognized as a predictor of protest participation and a platform for the coordination of connective actions, few studies have examined how digital media activities systematically relate to protesters’ mode of participation in protest campaigns. This study aims at filling the research gap through analyzing the Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong. It identifies time spent in the occupied areas, participation leadership, and forms of actions undertaken as three aspects of a protester's mode of participation that can indicate a protester's degree of involvement in the movement. Analysis of a protester onsite survey shows that the protesters were active in four types of digital media activities: online expression, online debates, online explanatory activities, and mobile communication. Digital media activities are generally positively related to degree of involvement, but the four types of activities are also related to the three aspects of mode of participation differently. The findings illustrate how digital media activities are integrated into individualized mode of participation in contemporary connective actions. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

AB  - In contemporary life, the mobile phone is integral to digital and material placemaking practices. In this article, drawing on ethnographic analysis conducted in Perth and Melbourne (Australia) in the first months of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, we explore how this relation has been recalibrated as an effect of 'stay-at-home' restrictions. We first provide a brief overview of our methodological and interpretative approach – drawing from postphenomenology as a useful framework for understanding the mobile–body–place relation and digital placemaking at home. Second, we consider how mobile media are 'situated' in the domestic environment. Third, through an analysis of participant narratives, we explore the concept of net locality (Gordon and de Souza e Silva (2011) through the lens of embodiment theory and suggest that the Covid-19 context has altered our experience of 'networked corporeality'. Finally, we discuss the ambiguity of digital intimacy in the decoupling of mobile media and the body as a result of a rapid increase in both screen time and time spent at home. Throughout the article, we argue that mobile media use in the home is thoroughly enmeshed in the shifting boundaries of privacy, placemaking and domestic space. We question how the placemaking functionality of mobile media, the intimate body–technology relation specific to mobile media practices and 'being-at-home' were subsequently modified by physical distancing and isolation.

AB  - Most existing research assumes 'phone use during face-to-face interactions' to be psychosocially detrimental. Drawing on the digital social multitasking framework, this study explored not only the negative but also positive implications of the behavior. A sample of 517 adolescents (Mage = 14.83, S.D. = 1.93; 50% female) recruited through the Qualtrics panel completed an online survey. Results showed that adolescents’ and their friend’s digital social multitasking were both associated with (1) greater perceived efficiency, which, in turn, was associated with competence need satisfaction, and (2) greater perceived connection, which, in turn, was associated with better friendship quality, autonomy need satisfaction, and relatedness need satisfaction. Adolescents’ own multitasking also had an indirect, negative relationship with friendship quality through perceived distraction, but friend’s multitasking did not compromise friendship quality. The study provides a more balanced picture, showing that despite the potential harm of digital social multitasking, adolescents’ phone use during face-to-face peer interactions also involves potential benefits for teens’ psychosocial well-being.

AB  - This article presents results on how students became engaged and motivated when using digital storytelling in knowledge creation in Finland, Greece and California. The theoretical framework is based on sociocultural theories. Learning is seen as a result of dialogical interactions between people, substances and artefacts. This approach has been used in the creation of the Global Sharing Pedagogy (GSP) model for the empirical study of student levels of engagement in learning twenty-first century skills. This model presents a set of conceptual mediators for student-driven knowledge creation, collaboration, networking and digital literacy. Data from 319 students were collected using follow-up questionnaires after the digital storytelling project. Descriptive statistical methods, correlations, analysis of variance and regression analysis were used. The mediators of the GSP model strongly predicted student motivation and enthusiasm as well as their learning outcomes. The digital storytelling project, using the technological platform Mobile Video Experience (MoViE), was very successful in teaching twenty-first century skills.

AB  - This paper uses as its base a key initiative involving a not-for-profit organisation (NPO), government start-up funding and a social enterprise which evolved through three phases. The purpose of the initiative was the development of a smart phone technology platform for people with disability. The paper's purpose is to answer questions about the ways in which the mobile technology, seen here as assistive technologies, supported the development of disability citizenship and active citizenship. Data were collected through in-depth interviews conducted at three points in the 13-week programme during which participants with disability received customised support for their phone and training in its use, at no cost. Fifteen participants volunteered to take part in the research project, along with their significant other and service provider. Key themes were identified in the preliminary analysis. Exploring these using Ragnedda's ([2017]. The third digital divide: A Weberian approach to digital inequalities. Abingdon: Routledge) three levels of digital divide, and Wilson's ([2006]. The information revolution and developing countries. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press) categories of access allowed a series of philosophical, ethical and human services management questions to emerge, challenging the optimism with which the digital economy is presented as a solution to issues of inequality. Although the mobile technologies were very successful as assistive technologies for some participants, the findings reinforced the potential for such technologies to further entrench aspects of social exclusion. They also identified ways in which the shift in the role of the NPO to social entrepreneurship, and its relationships with government and private enterprise, had the potential to undermine the exercise of disability citizenship by turning participants into consumers.

AB  - In a networked society, humans are connected through mobile devices to always-on networks, and these technologies merge with us in new ways. In this environment, studying human-networked interactions involves an expanded type of usability. In this article, we argue that a key component of usability is how humans connect and disconnect from these networks. For this reason, the authors advocate studying how users connect and disconnect between online and offline contexts in their everyday life. Such an effort involves questioning our assumptions about the role of connection in usability and introduces methodological issues in studying these processes. These shifts require our research to be more multidisciplinary and more methodologically demanding, with major implications for the portability and durability of technical communication research.

AB  - Background: Smartphone-based disease management has become increasingly interesting for research in the field of bipolar disorders. This article investigates the attitudes of persons affected by this disorder towards the appropriation of mobile apps or assistance systems for the management of their disease. Methods: We conducted two separate studies. Study 1 was an online survey with 88 participants. In study 2 we consulted 15 participants during a semi-structured interview. All the participants had formerly been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Results: More than half of the participants of study 1 and most participants of study 2 agreed with the use of an app or assistance system for self-ratings, third party ratings and an objective symptom monitoring. Potential interventions that were popular in both groups included a regular feedback, the visualization of monitored data and advice in crises. Limitations: With study 1 we were not able to ensure correct diagnoses or to interact in a flexible way. In Study 2 those issues were resolved, but the small number of participants raises the question of a possible generalisability of the results. Furthermore, for both studies a selection bias could not be excluded. Conclusions: Our results indicate positive attitudes of bipolar patients towards disease management apps and assistance systems. Even new and innovative features such as partner apps or the analysis of facial expressions in video data were appreciated and daily interactions were favoured. However, the variety of answers calls for flexible systems which allow activating or deactivating certain features. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In 2014, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation released a five-year plan entitled A Space For Us All. The plan outlined a bold new vision for the Canadian public broadcaster, placing digital mobile content at the forefront of the corporation’s priorities. This article examines the shifting priorities of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation against established principles of public broadcasting. It also interrogates the relationship between mobile digital media and legal obligations of the public broadcaster under current Canadian broadcasting regulation. Drawing upon Canadian broadcasting history, contemporary data and recent examples from sport and politics in Canada, the article questions this new direction for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and argues that despite the significant new opportunities in mobile digital media, traditional broadcasting methods remain the dominant tool to reach mass audiences and will provide a significant forum for public information and debate for the foreseeable future.

AB  - Mobile devices facilitate the use of mobile services that are similar to services used via fixed Internet connections. The objective of this article is to assess displacement effects between fixed and mobile Internet services, and to research the role of technical capabilities of mobile handsets and demographics as moderators. This study is based on a sample of 628 respondents who have access to fixed and mobile Internet services. The respondents' usage of services was analyzed. An online questionnaire was used to collect data on the use of information, communication, entertainment, and transaction services. Mobile Internet reinforces, rather than replaces, Internet usage. When people possess an iPhone® or (mobile) laptop, this reinforcement effect is present for entertainment services. With respect to transaction services, the Blackberry® makes a stronger case. With the exception of gender, demographic characteristics do not have a moderating effect. Women display a stronger reinforcement effect than men in relation to transaction services. To the best of our knowledge, no study to date has investigated the displacement effects of fixed Internet services by the mobile handset. This empirical study contributes to the literature regarding the displacement effects of mobile Internet services. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Videos are often used in web surveys to assess attitudes. While including videos may allow researchers to test immediate reactions, there may be issues associated with displaying videos that are overlooked. In this article, we examine the effects of using video stimuli on responses in a probability-based web survey. Specifically, we evaluate the association between demographics, mobile device usage, and the ability to view videos; differences in ad recall based on whether respondents saw a video or still images of the video; whether respondents’ complete viewing of videos is related to presentation order; and the data quality of follow-up questions to the videos as a function of presentation order and complete viewing. Overall, we found that respondents using mobile browsers were less likely to be able to view videos in the survey. Those who could view videos were more likely to indicate recall compared to those who viewed images, and videos that were shown later in the survey were viewed in their entirety less frequently than those shown earlier. These results directly pertain to the legitimacy of using videos in web surveys to gather data about attitudes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The aim of this paper is to evaluate the use of mobile instant messaging (MIM) apps from the perspective of the user. The objective is to verify what is the perceived usefulness, perceived value of use and usability of this new channel of communication utilized with customers and to verify if there are premises for considering instant messaging services as a new platform for customer engagement. Drawing from the Technology Acceptance Model, this study tests the consumers' perception of the use of mobile services with organizations. Data was made available for analysis from an online survey of 470 respondents. Results show that customers see MIM apps as an effective tool for customer care. Moreover, interaction through MIM apps adds value to the customer-brand relationship. MIM apps used as support to the relationship with customers can contribute to customer care, revealing it to be an excellent marketing tool in support of the customer journey. This research extends the understanding of customer engagement in the ambit of the instant messaging application used for business that so far has not been investigated. This work shows how instant messaging can optimize the benefits deriving from the adoption of disruptive innovations. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In this article, we explore the online multiobject k‐coverage problem in visual sensor networks. This problem combines k‐coverage and the cooperative multirobot observation of multiple moving targets problem, and thereby captures key features of rapidly deployed camera networks, including redundancy and team‐based tracking of evasive or unpredictable targets. The benefits of using mobile cameras are demonstrated and we explore the balance of autonomy between cameras generating new subgoals, and those responders able to fulfill them. We show that higher performance against global goals is achieved when decisions are delegated to potential responders who treat subgoals as optional, rather than as obligations that override existing goals without question. This is because responders have up‐to‐date knowledge of their own state and progress toward goals where they are situated, which is typically old or incomplete at locations remote from them. Examining the extent to which approaches overprovision or underprovision coverage, we find that being well suited for achieving 1‐coverage does not imply good performance at k‐coverage. Depending on the structure of the environment, the problems of 1‐coverage and k‐coverage are not necessarily aligned and that there is often a trade‐off to be made between standard coverage maximization and achieving k‐coverage.

AB  - We administered an anonymous 1-page survey to 55 consecutive patients attending their first appointment at the Nepean Anxiety Disorders Clinic in Penrith, N.S.W., Australia. The survey asked respondents to rate their preferences for 5 forms of therapy delivery: individual face-to-face therapy, group face-to-face therapy, bibliotherapy (where therapy is exclusively provided by means of books and reading materials that are posted to patients), online therapy without therapist contact and online therapy with weekly therapist phone contact. The results of our survey suggest that patients overwhelmingly preferred individual face-to-face therapy to all other delivery options. Importantly, this does not appear to be a consequence of a lack of basic and affirmative information about the alternative therapy modalities, given that such information was provided by the survey.

AB  - ABSTRACT Surveys continue to be a popular way of collecting data in the social sciences. But, despite their popularity they have a number of limitations including the possibility of changing the behaviour of respondents. Such mere-measure or question-behaviour effects can compromise the external validity of social data. In this article, we use digital trace data collected from PCs and mobile devices to investigate the effects of surveys on news and politics consumption. Using a non-probability panel of respondents in Germany we combine the digital trace data with that from three online surveys regarding the federal election. In contrast to our expectation, the participation in the survey does not influence online news and politics media consumption. Furthermore, we find weak evidence that respondents with previous high media consumption are less likely to be influenced by doing the survey compared to those with low media consumption.

AB  - Survey research has long grappled with the concept of survey mode preference: the idea that a respondent may prefer to participate in one survey mode over another. This article experimentally examines the effect of mode preference on response, contact, and cooperation rates; mode choice; and data collection efficiency. Respondents to a 2008 telephone survey (n = 1,811; AAPOR RR3 = 38 percent) were asked their mode preference for future survey participation. These respondents were subsequently followed up in 2009 with two independent survey requests. The first follow-up survey request was another telephone survey (n = 548; AAPOR RR2 = 55.5 percent). In the second follow-up survey (n = 565; AAPOR RR2 = 46.0 percent), respondents were randomly assigned to one of four mode treatments: Web only, mail only, Web followed by mail, and mail followed by Web. We find that mode preference predicts participation in Web and phone modes, cooperation in phone mode (where contact and cooperation can be disentangled), and the selection of a mode when given the option of two modes. We find weak and mixed evidence about the relationship between mode preference and reduction of field effort. We discuss the important implications these findings have for mixed mode surveys.

AB  - Mobile coverage recently has reached an all-time high, and in most countries, high-speed Internet connections are widely available. Due to technological development, smartphones and tablets have become increasingly popular. Accordingly, we have observed an increasing use of mobile devices to complete web surveys and, hence, survey methodologists have shifted their attention to the challenges that stem from this development. The present study investigated whether the growing use of smartphones has decreased how systematically this choice of device varies between groups of respondents (i.e., how selective smartphone usage for completing web surveys is). We collected a data set of 18,520 respondents from 18 web surveys that were fielded in Germany between 2012 and 2016. Based on these data, we show that while the use of smartphones to complete web surveys has considerably increased over time, selectivity with respect to using this device has remained stable.

AB  - Context: Given the power and pervasiveness of technology, this paper considers whether it can help doctors to access, use and share knowledge and thus contribute to their ability to uphold the part of the Hippocratic Oath concerned with respecting ‘the hard‐won scientific gains of those physicians in whose steps I walk’ and sharing ‘such knowledge as is mine with those who are to follow’. How technology supports connections between doctors and knowledge is considered by focusing on the use of mobile technology in the workplace and Web 2.0 tools. Methods: Sfard's ‘acquisition’ and ‘participation’ models are employed to help develop an understanding of what these uses of technology mean for learning and knowledge sharing. Discussion: The employment of technology is not neutral in its effects. Issues relate to knowledge ownership, information overload, quality control and interpretations attached to the use of mobile devices in the workplace. These issues raise deeper questions about the nature of knowledge and social theory and socio‐material research questions about the effect of technology on workplace learning. Conclusion: Although the empirical and theoretical evidence presented shows how technology has clear potential to contribute both to accessing evidence and sharing knowledge, there is need for further research that applies theoretical frameworks to the analysis of the impact of technology on workplace learning.

AB  - This study employed a mixed methods approach (a survey [n = 2,774] and focus groups [n = 16]) to understand the perceptions of younger drivers (18–25) on current smartphone laws in the Australian state of Victoria. First, by analysing quantitative data gathered from an online survey regarding smartphone laws, perceptions of punishment when breaking the law, and attitudes to both the law and fines, this study found younger drivers were less likely to understand the law around phone use while driving, even after direct or indirect experience with police. Additionally, the severity and impact of fines were perceived as more impactful and severe among younger drivers, women, and those on lower incomes, and the most common types of illegal use younger drivers engaged with were navigation, music applications, and hands-free calling, mostly facilitated through Bluetooth with their device placed out of sight. Consequently, focus groups were conducted with a subset of these younger drivers to explore these findings in more depth. It was revealed that smartphone laws were perceived to be ambiguous, at times unreasonable, and difficult to access conclusive information regarding the law or receive information throughout the Graduated Licencing Program. Additionally, of full licenced drivers breaking smartphone laws (n = 807), 61.7 percent never used a cradle. Among probationary drivers breaking the law (n = 209), 76.1 percent never used a cradle. This suggests rampant surreptitious illegal use. As such, younger drivers learning to drive are also learning methods to avoid punishment while breaking smartphone laws. This included not using a cradle and opting instead for Bluetooth connectivity or engaging in hand-held use, a choice that continued into Full Licensed driving. The severity of punishment was not common knowledge and was perceived to be incommensurate to the risks associated with certain types of use. In their opinion all of these factors reduced the legitimacy of the law. Addressing these factors with evidence-based countermeasures may increase compliance and road safety.

AB  - This study tests two models of perceptual disconfirmation. Perceptual disconfirmation occurs when individuals have a negative expectation regarding their future conversation partners’ demeanor, but after conversing with and influencing their partners’ behavior, individuals’ assessment of their partners’ demeanor becomes more positive. This effect is, so far, novel to computer-mediated communication: When individuals with similar expectancies get acquainted using phone or face-to-face channels their negative preinteraction expectancies persist and assessments remain unchanged. This experiment explored the extent to which questions and disclosures, and partners’ disclosive responses, mediated perceptual disconfirmation. Individuals were led to believe that a dyadic conversation partner was either in a bad mood (negative and malleable expectation) or had a bad personality (negative and nonmalleable expectation). After a 30-min online conversation to get acquainted, perceptual disconfirmation emerged, although the verbal strategies did not mediate the effect. This study raises new questions about the process by which individuals who have negative expectancies of their future conversation partners defy these negative expectations and shift their attitudes to become more positive online.

AB  - The article first introduces the domestication approach, its origins, its key elements, and its general contributions and limitations. It then examines ways in which the domestication analysis could be developed. One issue concerns contemporary objects of study and research questions given developments in information and communication technologies since the earliest domestication studies. Other issues include developing the analysis of the centrality of ICTs in our lives. Where appropriate, these issues are illustrated by considering examples of the computer, the Internet, and the mobile phone. To illustrate how the domestication framework can inform wider academic and policy fields, the final section considers its contribution to debates about the digital divide. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]
AB  - Cet article porte sur la domestication en tant que théorie sur la manière dont l'individu intègre de nouveaux objets dans son quotidien. Il décrit les grandes lignes de cette approche, ses origines, ses éléments clés et ses contributions et limitations générales. Il examine ensuite certaines manières dont on pourrait faire avancer cette théorie aujourd'hui. Une possibilité concernerait le développement des technologies de l'information et de la communication (TIC) depuis les premières études en domestication, et l'impact des TIC sur les objets d'étude et les questions de recherche contemporains. Une autre possibilité consisterait à approfondir l'analyse de la centralité des TIC dans la vie quotidienne. Cet article, quand cela s'avère pertinent, a recours aux exemples de l'ordinateur, de l'Internet et du téléphone mobile. La section finale considère la contribution de la domestication aux débats sur le fossé numérique, afin de montrer comment cette théorie peut jeter de la lumière sur des questions académiques et politiques plus vastes.

AB  - With the proliferation of mobile devices and online video services, mobile learning has grown both in popularity and complexity. New challenges include the multitude of mobile devices with different characteristics and limitations, as well as the exponential growth in educational multimedia content. Streaming multimedia content to mobile devices is a resource intensive task that requires significant resources such as network bandwidth, with demand expected to increase beyond future networks capacity as users adopt new technologies such as UHD, AR, VR, 3D and 360-degree video. While a number of adaptive m-learning systems have been previously proposed, none of these have thoroughly addressed the adaptation of educational multimedia content. This article proposes the novel DQAMLearn framework that aims to support mobile learner’s seamless access to educational multimedia content from a variety of mobile devices with different characteristics. Moreover, as mobile users are increasingly becoming quality-aware, the framework integrates novel mechanisms for decreasing the video quality in a controlled way, with the aim to support a good learner quality of experience (QoE) even in resource constrained situations. A comprehensive subjective study was conducted to evaluate the proposed framework. The results showed that the framework enables both high learning achievement from educational multimedia clips, with 12% and 83% correct response rates for pre and post-test questionnaires, respectively, and high learner QoE with a mean video quality rating of 79.19 on a 0–100 acceptability scale.

AB  - Online environments can be programmed to make use of movable, drag & drop objects. A drag & drop object is a geometric figure (which may contain text, pictures, or both) whose position on the screen can be changed by the user. Typically, a user accomplishes this by (a) moving the cursor over the object with a mouse or other pointing device, (b) holding down button that 'grabs' the object, (c) dragging the object to a new location by sliding the mouse or pointing device, and (d) dropping the object at the new location by releasing the button. Drag & drop objects can be useful in several self-administered measurement domains of interest to social scientists; these include visual analogue scales (VASs; Couper, Tourangeau, & Conrad, 2006), ranking tasks (Neubarth, 2008; Thurstone, 1931), magnitude scaling (Lodge, 1981), ideal scaling (Barrett, 2005; Ryf, 2007), preference point maps (Harris Interactive, 2007), and various grouping or sorting tasks (Coxon, 1999). Even preference statements (Hensher, Rose, & Greene, 2005), choice analyses (Hensher et al., 2005), and the measurement of similarities or dissimilarities (Bijmolt & Wedel, 1995; Borg & Groenen, 2005) can benefit from using movable objects instead of simple hypertext markup language (HTML) forms. This chapter explains how to implement a measurement framework for movable objects in Web questionnaires, how to define objects that can be dragged across all or predefined sections of the screen, and how to process the x- and y-coordinates of the objects. I provide code that restricts the range of the drag & drop objects to a predefined area. I also provide a function that allows one to align the objects smoothly after they are dropped. Finally, I suggest some practical applications for the movable object method and provide some further resources. This chapter will be useful to researchers who want to use drag & drop functionality in their Web research. It will also be useful for those who want to learn more about the technical basics of the document object model (DOM; see Keith, 2005, and Marini, 2002). The DOM allows objects to be moved and their positions to be saved into a data set. The chapter will also be useful to those who want to learn about the research possibilities afforded by drag & drop functionality. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study proposes an integrated technology acceptance model to investigate the factors that affect drivers’ usage intention of mobile navigation applications. The proposed model adds three new constructs (drivers’ sense of direction, navigation application affinity and distraction perception) to the original technology acceptance model based on the features of mobile navigation applications. First, a questionnaire was developed and administered, and data from 384 drivers were collected via an online survey. Second, confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to examine the reliability and validity of the developed scale based on the collected data. Third, a structural equation model was constructed to investigate the interrelationships among these constructs in the conceptual research model and to identify the key factors that affect drivers’ acceptance of mobile navigation applications. The proposed model explained 60.50% of the variance in the intention to use mobile navigation applications. In addition to attitude and perceived usefulness, navigation application affinity and distraction perception also significantly affected drivers’ intention to use mobile navigation applications. Navigation application affinity and distraction perception affected not only drivers’ intention to use but also their perceptions. Sense of direction was a significant individual trait that affected drivers’ navigation application affinity, distraction perception, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. These findings imply that relevant developers should continually optimize the incorrect and inappropriate use of navigation information and that they should attach importance to the amount and intelligibility of navigation information. Furthermore, the prompt form of navigation information should satisfy the demands and expectations of drivers with different senses of direction. Overall, this study improves our understanding of drivers’ acceptance of mobile navigation applications and provides some important practical implications to improve mobile navigation services.

AB  - Although research interest in post adoption behavior of ICT (Information and Communication Technology)users increases from year to year, few studies examine how motivational factors and service type influence post adoption behavior. This study investigates the antecedents of post adoption behavior in the Mobile Data Services (MDS) domain. The study conducted a nationwide online survey in Korea to verify the proposed research model that includes motivational factors and service type. Two extrinsic motivation factors (post usefulness and post monetary value) and two intrinsic motivation factors (post ease of use and post enjoyment) are the main components of the motivational factors. The results of the study reveal that the motivational factors and service type influence the post adopter type in the MDS context. The findings of this study help provide guidelines for MDS providers to select a target market and to devise a strategy that meets the stated objectives of the selected market.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced social inequality in marginalized groups. People with disabilities (PWD) are particularly restricted in their activities and lives due to the pandemic and experiencing more difficulties than the general population. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the extent of the digital divide between PWD and people without disabilities (PWOD) during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea. METHODS: This study relied on the cross-sectional secondary data from the 2020 Digital Divide Survey conducted in Korea. We performed a series of bivariate analyses on the data of 5575 PWOD and 1781 PWD (18–69 years old) to compare Internet usage and various types of digital services related to the pandemic. RESULTS: We identified significant differences between PWOD and PWD in their Internet usage change during the pandemic. A higher number of PWD reported that their Internet usage with both computers and mobile devices remained similar to the pre-pandemic period while that of PWOD reported that their Internet usage via the same has increased. Significant gaps were found in the usage change of the five digital services with the largest gap in that of social networking services between PWOD and PWD. Further, PWOD were likelier to be aware of, utilize, and perceive the usefulness of digital services during the COVID-19 pandemic including application, information, delivery, and subscription services. CONCLUSION: To ensure better post-pandemic outcomes for marginalized groups including PWD, the governments and authority agencies must facilitate digital access and services with appropriate accommodations needed by those populations.

AB  - This work addresses the use of tablets and smartphones to enhance both student learning and engagement. Tablets were tested as potential substitutes for digital whiteboards, while smartphones were tested as potential survey media in the classroom using a question and answer method. Two teaching strategies were evaluated and compared: (1) traditional, which includes the use of the blackboard together with PowerPoint presentations and (2) interactive, where lessons are taught with the aid of a tablet, using interactive activities and digital materials. Measures of performance outcomes achieved with these strategies were made using the question and answer method at two points, during the classes and during the end-of-term examination. Three different question and answer methodologies were studied and compared, ranging from the very traditional method where students raise their hand to answer a question to the most modern where students use their smartphones to answer. The findings demonstrated higher outcomes with interactive lessons than with traditional learning (PowerPoint included). Tablets proved to be an effective and cheaper substitute for interactive whiteboards during lessons. The results suggested that the use of interactive procedures increased student participation. Furthermore, the students were very receptive to the use of smartphones as survey media. The use of smartphones as clickers is an interesting and instant way for both teachers and students to check students’ learning and perceived engagement. Considering that students are advanced users of smartphones and/or tablets, the use of these may be considered as more convenient than clickers. In addition, it is economically more acceptable than some other audience response systems. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study developed a Mobile Plant Learning System (MPLS) that provides instructors with the ways and means to facilitate student learning in an elementary-school-level botany course. The MPLS represented in this study was implemented to address problems that arise with the use of a didactic approach to teaching and learning botany, as is typically used in elementary schools in Taiwan. To extend opportunities for learning beyond the classroom, this study used personal digital assistants (PDAs) equipped with the MPLS, which provided both teachers and students access to plant information while in the field. A quasi-experimental research design was used to investigate the effectiveness of using the MPLS to support student learning. The responses to questionnaires and interviews indicate that students valued the outdoor learning activities made possible by use of the PDA and its functions. Pre- and post-test results demonstrated that students also benefitted academically from the use of the MPLS and the PDA. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Extensive reading (ER) in EFL is an approach to language learning that involves reading as much as possible for pleasure or information. ER improves reading speed and vocabulary acquisition and helps develop positive attitudes towards reading in general. The widespread use of digital devices such as mobile phones and tablets in and out of school has considerably widened the reading possibilities for EFL learners. ER through mobile devices is an emerging area of study and this chapter aims to contribute to the research by investigating its effects on vocabulary learning and student attitudes towards using mobile devices for their reading. The study records the results of an e-book ER programme at lower secondary school level in the Milan metropolitan area in Italy. The participants were 72 11-year-old students from two state schools. The students read 16 e-books at CEFR A1 and A2 levels over the course of eight months alongside the standard EFL school programme. Following a mixed method approach, the teachers, who were also researchers, asked students to complete a test on vocabulary items selected from the e-books both pre- and post-programme. Results from the analysis of vocabulary tests and questionnaires show positive effects of e-reading on incidental vocabulary learning and increased motivation towards EFL reading on mobile devices.

AB  - This study aimed at developing and testing a model that can explain how overload perceived in relation to organizational use of mobile instant messaging services (MIMs) leads to burnout and turnover intention in employees through the mediating effect of roleoriented stressors such as role ambiguity and role conflict. To empirically test the model, an online survey was conducted with 434 office workers in South Korea who used KakaoTalk for organizational purposes. Overload in KakaoTalk use was measured in three dimensions: information, communication, and system feature overload. Path analysis results showed that information overload and system feature overload significantly increased role ambiguity and role conflict, which ultimately led to significant increases in burnout (in the form of emotional exhaustion and reduced personal achievement) and turnover intention.

AB  - Zielsetzung: Es ist vorgeschlagen worden, dass der nächste große Fortschritt in der Hörgerätetechnologie (HA) kognitives Feedback vom Benutzer zur Steuerung der HA-Funktionalität beinhalten muss. Um automatische hirnwellengesteuerte HA-Anpassungen zu ermöglichen, müssen die Aufmerksamkeitsprozesse, die der Sprach-Lärm-Wahrnehmung bei hörgeschädigten Personen zugrunde liegen, besser verstanden werden. Hier haben wir uns mit dem Einfluss zweier wichtiger Faktoren für die Hörleistung von HA-Trägern, der Hörgeräteverarbeitung und der Motivation, befasst, indem wir die laufenden neuronalen Reaktionen während des langfristigen Hörens kontinuierlicher geräuschvoller Sprache analysierten. Die Methoden: Sechzehn normalhörende (NH) und 15 linear hörgeschädigte (aHI) Teilnehmer hörten eine Hörbuchaufnahme, eingebettet in realistische Sprachlappergeräusche bei individuell angepassten Signal-Rausch-Abständen (SNRs). Ein HA-Simulator wurde sowohl für die Simulation einer Richtmikrofoneinstellung als auch für die individuelle Verstärkung verwendet. Um das Hörverhalten beurteilen zu können, beantworteten die Teilnehmer Fragen zum Inhalt des Hörbuchs. Wir manipulierten (1) die Motivation der Teilnehmer, indem wir in einer Hälfte der Messungen eine monetäre Belohnung für gute Hörleistung anboten, und (2) das SNR, indem wir die Einstellung des Richtmikrofons ein- und ausschalteten. Während der Speech-in-Noise-Aufgabe wurden Elektroenzephalographie-Signale (EEG) mit drahtloser, mobiler Hardware aufgezeichnet. EEG-Korrelate der Hörleistung wurden mit Hilfe von EEG-Impulsantworten untersucht, die anhand der Kreuzkorrelation zwischen dem aufgezeichneten EEG-Signal und der zeitlichen Einhüllenden des Hörbuchs am Ausgang des HA-Simulators geschätzt wurden. Ergebnisse: Auf der Verhaltensebene beobachteten wir bei den NH-Hörern eine bessere Leistung als bei den aHI-Hörern. Darüber hinaus führte die Einstellung des Richtmikrofons zu einer besseren Leistung für beide Teilnehmergruppen, und wenn die Einstellung des Richtmikrofons ausgeschaltet wurde, verbesserte sich die Motivation auch die Leistung der aHI-Teilnehmer. Die Analyse der EEG-Impulsantworten zeigte schnellere N1-P2-Reaktionen für beide Gruppen und grössere N2-Spitzenamplituden für die aHI-Gruppe, wenn die Richtmikrofoneinstellung aktiviert war, aber keine physiologischen Korrelationen der Motivation. Die Bedeutung: Die Ergebnisse dieser Studie weisen darauf hin, dass die Motivation eine wichtige Rolle für das Sprachverstehen im Lärm spielt. In Bezug auf neuro-gesteuerte HAs deuten unsere Ergebnisse darauf hin, dass die Latenz der Aufmerksamkeitsprozesse durch HA-induzierte Reizveränderungen beeinflusst wird, was potenziell genutzt werden kann, um einen Nutzen aus der automatischen Geräuschunterdrückungsverarbeitung abzuleiten. Weitere Forschung ist notwendig, um die neuronalen Korrelate der Motivation als exklusiven Top-down-Prozess zu identifizieren und solche Merkmale mit HA-getriebenen für Online-HA-Anpassungen zu kombinieren.

AB  - Objective: It has been suggested that the next major advancement in hearing aid (HA) technology needs to include cognitive feedback from the user to control HA functionality. In order to enable automatic brainwave-steered HA adjustments, attentional processes underlying speech-in-noise perception in aided hearing-impaired individuals need to be better understood. Here, we addressed the influence of two important factors for the listening performance of HA users hearing aid processing and motivation by analysing ongoing neural responses during long-term listening to continuous noisy speech. Methods: Sixteen normal-hearing (NH) and 15 linearly aided hearing-impaired (aHI) participants listened to an audiobook recording embedded in realistic speech babble noise at individually adjusted signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). A HA simulator was used for simulating a directional microphone setting as well as for providing individual amplification. To assess listening performance behaviourally, participants answered questions about the contents of the audiobook. We manipulated (1) the participants' motivation by offering a monetary reward for good listening performance in one half of the measurements and (2) the SNR by engaging/disengaging the directional microphone setting. During the speech-in-noise task, electroencephalography (EEG) signals were recorded using wireless, mobile hardware. EEG correlates of listening performance were investigated using EEG impulse responses, as estimated using the cross-correlation between the recorded EEG signal and the temporal envelope of the audiobook at the output of the HA simulator. Results: At the behavioural level, we observed better performance for the NH listeners than for the aHI listeners. Furthermore, the directional microphone setting led to better performance for both participant groups, and when the directional microphone setting was disengaged motivation also improved the performance of the aHI participants. Analysis of the EEG impulse responses showed faster N1-P2 responses for both groups and larger N2 peak amplitudes for the aHI group when the directional microphone setting was activated, but no physiological correlates of motivation. Significance: The results of this study indicate that motivation plays an important role for speech understanding in noise. In terms of neuro-steered HAs, our results suggest that the latency of attentional processes is influenced by HA-induced stimulus changes, which can potentially be used for inferring benefit from noise suppression processing automatically. Further research is necessary to identify the neural correlates of motivation as an exclusive top-down process and to combine such features with HA driven ones for online HA adjustments.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of the study was to examine associations of gender role beliefs with marital safety as well as social and digital connectivity among married adolescent girls in India. Methods: We analyzed cross-sectional survey data from married adolescent girls from rural Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, India in 2015–2016 (N = 4,893). Gender role belief items assessed participants' beliefs regarding appropriateness of female marital choice and economic decision-making, male childcare responsibility, and marital violence. The outcomes were time with friends (social connection), freedom of movement, mobile phone ownership and internet access (digital connection), and safety from marital violence (marital safety). Adjusted regression models examined associations between gender role beliefs and outcomes, caste/religion beliefs related to segregation, and demographics. Results: Beliefs supportive of female marital choice (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00–1.88, p = .048) and female economic decision-making (AOR 1.43, 95% CI 1.03–1.99, p = .03) were associated with social connection. Beliefs supportive of female marital choice (AOR 1.88, 95% CI 1.31–2.71, p = .001), female economic decision-making (AOR 1.67, 95% CI 1.03–2.72, p = .04), and male childcare responsibilities (AOR 1.42, 95% CI 1.05–1.94, p = .03) were associated with freedom of movement. Belief supporting female marital choice was associated with mobile phone ownership (AOR 1.23, 95% CI 1.01–1.50, p = .04), and belief supporting male childcare responsibility was associated with internet access (AOR 1.76, 95% CI 1.11–2.77, p = .02). Beliefs supportive of female marital choice (AOR .73, 95% CI .59–.89, p = .003), male childcare responsibility (AOR 1.26, 95% CI 1.03–1.54, p = .02), and unacceptability of marital violence (AOR 1.72, 95% CI 1.38–2.15, p < .001) were associated with safety from marital violence. Conclusions: Progressive gender role beliefs regarding female choice, control, and safety in marriage are associated with greater connectivity and safety for married adolescent girls in India. Future studies that can longitudinally assess these associations are warranted. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Investigated the effects of learning questions on self-regulated learning in Web-based learning environments (Web-LEs) in a series of three studies. In Study 1, 81 students received interactive learning questions different points of the study phase or did not receive any learning questions. Results showed a significant learning effect for all learning-questions groups compared to the control group. The second study presents findings from two experiments which dealt with the different ways of implementing sets of learning questions in Web-LEs. The first experiment investigated the effect of different learning questions distributions on learning activities and achievement. Participants (n = 61) worked on learning questions distributed within the learning environment in a fine-grained way, in a medium-grained way, or presented blocked. Blocked presentation of learning questions resulted in less achievement compared to medium-grained and fine-grained distribution of the same learning questions. Learning process data indicated that participants of the medium-grained group reported more monitoring of their learning process. The second experiment (n = 61) investigated effects of different learning questions on regulation. Two kinds of learning questions with differences in the feedback component and the number of distractors were compared to a no-learning questions group. A detailed analysis of the learning process revealed that elaborative feedback leads to better achievement if students use their opportunity to restudy content. Additionally, the number of learning questions solved in the guidance-learning question group correlated with achievement. The third study addressed how learning questions provided at the beginning of a study phase influence SRL and under what conditions they improve achievement. 122 participants worked either on inference learning questions, factual learning questions, irrelevant learning questions or no learning questions at all before studying in a Web-LE. Results showed that irrelevant learning questions led to less time spent on the relevant material compared to the other three groups. A deeper analysis of the process data revealed that search strategy and reported effort and concentration in studying the relevant material were crucial for the successful use of learning questions. On the basis of these three experimental studies practical implications were deduced, and the tool "Auditorium Mobile Classroom Service" (AMCS) was developed. AMCS delivers learning questions to students in university lectures via their mobile devices. AMCS considers the findings from the three experimental studies and allows delivering additional prompts that aim at supporting the effects of learning questions. Findings from two field studies demonstrate how learning questions can be implemented in SRL settings and reveal first positive evaluation of acceptance and technical functionalities of the tool.

AB  - Survey participants are increasingly responding to Web surveys on their smartphones as opposed to their personal computers (PCs), and this change brings with it some potential data-quality issues. This study reports on a randomized crossover experiment to compare the effect of two different devices, smartphones and PCs, on response quality in a Web survey conducted in a probability-based panel. Participants (n = 1,390) were invited to complete an online questionnaire on both a smartphone (mobile Web) and PC (PC Web) in sequence. We hypothesized that smartphone use would result in lower-quality responses because people are more likely to use smartphones while multitasking or while around other people and because they could have difficulty recording their answers using a small touchscreen. While we found that respondents who participated in this study were more likely to multitask and more likely to be around other people when using smartphones, these factors had little impact on data quality. Respondents were at least as likely to provide conscientious and thoughtful answers and to disclose sensitive information on smartphones as on PCs. When using smartphones, however, respondents seemed to have trouble accurately moving a small-sized slider handle and a date-picker wheel to the intended values. Overall, we find that people using smartphones can provide high-quality responses, even when their context is more distracting, as long as they are presented with question formats that are easy to use on small touchscreens.

AB  - The role of working memory (WM) components, such as phonological loop, in online inferential processing has thus far not been empirically examined with a dual‐task paradigm. The current study used an online method to examine the effects of the two components of phonological loop—the articulatory rehearsal device and the phonological store device—on online causal inference generation during Chinese text reading. Eighty‐five Chinese university students read three‐sentence inference and control texts and responded to comprehension questions related to targeted inferences in different reading conditions. The results showed that in the articulatory suppression condition, response times (RTs) for comprehension questions of inference texts were considerably longer, and response errors were significantly higher than those in the normal reading condition, which indicated the effects of the articulatory rehearsal device on readers' online causal inference processes during Chinese text reading. Moreover, RTs for comprehension questions of inference texts in the irrelevant speech condition were significantly shorter than those in the normal reading condition, suggesting effects of the phonological store device on readers' causal inference processes during reading. Taken together, these findings indicate that the articulatory rehearsal device plays an important role in inference processes, but readers allocate more cognitive resources to facilitate the construction of causal relations during text‐based inferential comprehension when function of the phonological store device is impaired.

AB  - The increasing use of smartphones around the world provides new opportunities for network data collection using smartphone surveys. We investigated experimentally whether the use of smartphones and of a recall aid affects the number of reported names in a network name generator question. In a German online access panel (N = 3891), respondents were randomly assigned to answer the survey on their PC or on their smartphone and were randomly assigned to receive an open-ended recall aid question before the name generator question or after. Results showed that respondents on PCs and smartphones reported the same number of network contacts. This suggests that smartphone surveys have no negative effect on the network sizes in ego-centered network studies. However, requiring people to answer on smartphones resulted in a selection bias due to non-compliance, which may have led to an overrepresentation of persons with larger network sizes. The recall aid question did not lead to more reported names, but it proved to be an indicator of respondents’ motivation and response quality. In sum, the study suggests that smartphones can effectively be used for network research in tech-savvy populations or when respondents can choose to complete the survey on another device.

AB  - This study sought to overcome some of the methodological limitations in previous studies and clarify the role of attachment in the associations between texting and romantic relationship satisfaction. Specifically, a new, relative measure of texting usage was created to estimate the share of texting in communication compared to other channels (e.g., face-to-face, phone, and etc.), in addition to using the traditional, absolute measure of texting usage (i.e., the number of texts sent to partners). A sample of 395 participants completed an online survey regarding texting behavior. Background variables were controlled for in all analyses, particularly the physical distance between partners, which was often overlooked in previous research. The results suggested that texting share showed positive links with both attachment dimensions and a negative link with relationship satisfaction, whereas the sheer volume of texts had little association with attachment dimensions or satisfaction.

AB  - Objective: To determine the efficacy of portable electronic aids such as personal digital assistants (PDAs), pagers or mobile phones for patients with cognitive deficits by means of a systematic review. The usability of these aids is also briefly discussed. Data sources: PubMed, CINAHL, PsychINFO, EMBASE and MEDLINE were searched up to February 2009. The references of identified and relevant articles were scanned to find additional relevant titles. Review methods: Papers referring to ‘electronic aids’, ‘cognition’ and ‘brain injury’ were included. The population had to be adult and have cognitive impairments as a result of acquired brain injury. Outcome measures were change in cognitive or occupational performance or the level of participation in daily life. The criteria of Cicerone et al. were used to evaluate the quality of the retrieved studies. Results: Twenty-eight papers presenting 25 studies were reviewed. The total number of participants was 423. Most identified papers described case reports or non-randomized clinical trials. Only one randomized controlled trial was identified, in which the NeuroPage proved effective in supporting prospective memory. Other kinds of assistive technology such as PDAs and voice recorders showed positive results in supporting retrospective and prospective memory. Conclusion: The efficacy of assistive technology in general is not yet sufficiently studied in randomized controlled trials, although promising results has been reported. Furthermore, several survey studies established that both potential users and clinicians have optimistic expectations about the usability of assistive technology.

AB  - Through an experimental design, this article tests the efficiency of various recruitment strategies in a probability sample for a web panel. In order to test the five hypotheses, contact phone, contact SMS, incentives, sponsorship and social proof, the authors conducted a recruitment experiment for a web panel. Five samples each consisting of 500 individuals were drawn from a random sample of 50,000 individuals on the Danish Civil Registration System. Web panels offer a number of advantages and possibilities in studies of public opinion. Recruiting members for such web panels can, however, be a difficult task, and there is a need for more knowledge about the efficiency of different recruitment strategies. The recruitment experiment for our web panel shows that telephone recruitment yields higher recruitment rates than both postal letter and SMS recruitment.

AB  - ABSTRACT The study attempts to identify the influential antecedents of customer satisfaction and repatronage intentions in the context of e-grocery retailing through mobile applications. Literature survey based on qualitative thematic approach was adopted for the study. The reviewed articles were selected based on Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) framework. The model was subjected to reliability and validity determination through Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). The hypotheses were tested through Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). SEM results revealed that out of the four proposed antecedents i.e. online tracking, design aesthetics, online rating & review, and perceived security risk, the initial three bear significant positive causal relationship with customer satisfaction. The existing study gives a perspective of e-grocery retailing based mobile applications in an emerging market, which is a departure from the past studies which are based on developed markets characterized by higher technology penetration and awareness amongst inhabiting populace.

AB  - While eHealth technologies such as web-based interventions, mobile apps, and virtual reality have the potential to be of added value for forensic mental healthcare, there is a gap between this potential and the current situation in practice. The goal of this study was to identify recommendations to bridge this gap. In total, 21 semi-structured interviews and 89 questionnaires were conducted in a Dutch forensic mental healthcare sample consisting of professionals, patients, and eHealth experts. Based on the broad range of identified recommendations, it can be concluded that attention should be paid to the characteristics of professionals, patients, technology, and the organization throughout the development, implementation and evaluation of eHealth.

AB  - Comments on an article by J. K. Pepper et al. (see record [rid]2013-02132-004[/rid]). Pepper et al. present the first study of a national sample of U.S. male adolescents' awareness, use, and susceptibility to using e-cigarettes. The 228 participants were sons of parents recruited to participate in an online panel. Pepper et al found high awareness of e-cigarettes—67%—but little use; < 1% had tried them. Of even greater importance, 18% of the sample endorsed being susceptible to trying e-cigarettes, and this was much higher (74%) among participants who reported current smoking. To date, only two studies of national data sets have provided a glimpse into awareness and use of e-cigarettes, and both were among adults. The high rate of awareness among youth is concerning, particularly because the literature raises concerns about e-cigarette products with regard to ingredient and device safety. Given the dearth of empirical research on e-cigarette products and who may be using them, the Pepper et al article makes an important contribution toward understanding how youth are responding to their availability. In their multivariate analysis, being a current smoker was strongly associated with willingness to try e-cigarettes. When the analysis was limited to nonsmoking participants, holding negative beliefs about the typical smoker was associated with less willingness to try e-cigarettes. These findings suggest that e-cigarettes may be perceived by adolescents as symbolically and functionally similar to tobacco cigarettes. Although these findings are limited by a male-only sample, known predictors of initiation of cigarette smoking, such as sensation seeking and positive smoking expectancies, may be relevant factors to examine in future research investigating e-cigarette use among adolescents.

AB  - Multiple computing devices continue to develop capabilities that support online gambling, resulting in the need to evaluate the extent that this trend will contribute to gambling problems. A sample of 1,141 participants completed an online survey assessing interest in and difficulties limiting use of digital services. Questionnaire items measured a range of behaviours associated with electronic service use (e.g., surfing, complaints). Results indicated that individuals utilising digital services and experiencing problems limiting their TV and Mobile phone usage were more likely to report gambling problems. These respondents were more likely to click on gambling-related links, report receiving larger amounts of spam, make more attempts to unsubscribe, and to click on links to counselling sites. Exposure and interest in electronic modes of communication can be associated with a greater risk of gambling related problems. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Introduction: Altered emotion dynamics may represent a transdiagnostic risk factor for mood psychopathology. The present study examined whether altered emotion dynamics were associated with bipolar and depressive psychopathology concurrently and at a three-year follow-up. Methods: At baseline (n = 138), participants completed diagnostic interviews, questionnaires, and seven days of experience sampling assessments. Four emotion dynamics were computed for negative affect (NA) and positive affect (PA) – within-person variance (variability), mean square of successive differences and probability of acute change (instability), and autocorrelation (inertia). At the three-year follow-up, participants (n = 108) were re-assessed via interviews and questionnaires. Results: NA variability was associated with bipolar spectrum disorders at baseline and follow-up. NA instability predicted depressive symptoms and hypomanic personality at baseline, and bipolar spectrum disorders at the follow-up. NA inertia did not predict diagnoses or symptoms at either assessment. PA inertia predicted hyperthymic temperament at baseline but not follow-up. Notably, NA variability and instability predicted the development of new bipolar spectrum disorders at the follow-up. Limitations: Consistent with the recruitment strategy and young age of the participants, only 50% had developed diagnosable psychopathology by the time of the follow-up assessment. Conclusions: The present study provided a unique demonstration that altered emotion dynamics differentially predicted bipolar and depressive psychopathology concurrently and prospectively. Emotion dynamics are important to both digital phenotyping and mobile-based interventions as emotional instability offers a measurable risk factor that is identifiable prior to illness onset.

AB  - While recent evidence has pointed to disturbances in emotion regulation strategy use in schizophrenia, few studies have examined how these regulation strategies relate to emotionality and social behavior in daily life. Using ecological momentary assessment (EMA), we investigated the relationship between emotion regulation, emotional experience, and social interaction in the daily lives of individuals with schizophrenia. Participants (N = 30) used mobile phones to complete online questionnaires reporting their daily emotional experience and social interaction. Participants also completed self-report measures of habitual emotion regulation. Hierarchical linear modeling revealed that self-reported use of cognitive reappraisal and savoring of emotional experiences were related to greater positive emotion in daily life. In contrast, self-reported suppression was related to greater negative emotion, reduced positive emotion, and reduced social interaction in daily life. These findings suggest that individual differences in habitual emotion regulation strategy usage have important relationships to everyday emotional and social experiences in schizophrenia.

AB  - Wearable technology has many industrial applications. Optimal use adherence and outcomes largely depend on employee acceptance of the technology. This study determined factors that predict employee acceptance of wearables. An online survey of 1273 employed adults asked about demographics, job and organizational characteristics, experience with and beliefs about wearables, and willingness to use wearables. Use cases focused on workplace safety elicited the highest acceptance. An employee's performance expectancy and their organizational safety climate were common predictors of acceptance across use cases. Positive past experiences coincided with involving employees in choosing the device and adequately informing them about data use. Organizations intending to implement wearable technology should (a) focus its use on improving workplace safety, (b) advance a positive safety climate, (c) ensure sufficient evidence to support employees' beliefs that the wearable will meet its objective, and (d) involve and inform employees in the process of selecting and implementing wearable technology.

AB  - Objective: The study aims were to identify: i.) energy drink (ED), caffeine tablet, and caffeine intranasal spray use amongst a sample who report drug use, and ii.) the association between ED use frequency and demographic profile, drug use, hazardous drinking, and wellbeing. Method: Participants (n = 74,864) who reported drug use completed the online 2014 Global Drug Survey. They provided data on demographics, ED use, and alcohol and drug use, completed the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and Personal Wellbeing Index (PWI), and reported whether they wished to reduce alcohol use. Results: Lifetime ED, caffeine tablet and intranasal caffeine spray use were reported by 69.2%, 24.5% and 4.9%. Median age of ED initiation was 16 years. For those aged 16–37, median years using EDs increased from 4 to 17 years of consumption, where it declined thereafter. Greater ED use frequency was associated with: being male; under 21 years of age; studying; and past year caffeine tablet/intranasal spray, tobacco, cannabis, amphetamine, MDMA, and cocaine use. Past year, infrequent (1–4days) and frequent (≥5days) past month ED consumers reported higher AUDIT scores and lower PWI scores than lifetime abstainers; past month consumers were less likely to report a desire to reduce alcohol use. Conclusions: ED use is part of a complex interplay of drug use, alcohol problems, and poorer personal wellbeing, and ED use frequency may be a flag for current/future problems. Prospective research is required exploring where ED use fits within the trajectory of other alcohol and drug use. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Mobile Internet applications run on devices such as smartphones and tablets, and have dramatically changed the landscape of applicationgenerated network traffic. The potent combination of millions of such applications and the instant accessibility of high-speed Internet on mobile devices through 3G and now LTE technology has also changed how users themselves interact with the Internet. Specifically, the radio states in LTE such as RRC_Connected and RRC_Idle were designed with more traditional applications such as web browsing and FTP in mind. These traditional applications typically generated traffic only during Active (Connected) state, and once the user session ended, usually the traffic ended too, thus allowing the radio to move to Inactive (Idle) state. However, newer applications such as Facebook and Twitter generate a constant stream of autonomous and/or user generated traffic at all times, thus erasing the previously clear demarcation between Active and Inactive states. This means a given mobile device (or user equipment, in LTE parlance) often ends up moving between Connected and Idle states frequently to send mostly short bursts of data, draining device battery and causing excessive signaling overhead in LTE networks. This problem has grown and attracted the research community's attention to address the negative effects of frequent back and forth transitions between LTE radio states. In this article, we first explore the traffic characteristics of these emerging mobile Internet applications and how they differ from more traditional applications. We investigate their impact on LTE device power and air interface signaling. We then present a survey of state-of-the-art solutions proposed in literature to address the problems, and analyze their merits and demerits. Lastly, we discuss the solutions adopted by 3GPP including the latest developments in Release 11 to handle these issues, and present potential future research directions in this field.

AB  - Until the late twentieth century the letter was still a central form of communication within the private and public spheres and across their somewhat fluid boundary. Not all letters survive but they do have a tangible form and even the epistles of the very ordinary can turn up in a descendant's attic, ripe for socio-historical analysis. This paper explores the shift away from letters and towards email and mobile phone messaging as forms of communication. Two contrasting sources are examined. The first is letters of offer that some young Victorian women wrote presenting their credentials to missionary societies. Although these may have been written largely as statements of religious belief, it is possible to read them as constructions of self and relationship. The second source is interviews with contemporary couples in distance relationships, where the couples discuss their use of email and texting. In particular we examine how these sources illustrate changes in relationship building, some of which may be related to the seemingly more ephemeral nature of digital media. Such an examination questions what constitutes a letter and how important letter writing is as a technique of relationship-building. This technique has clearly been subject to significant change as social relations have become mediated in new ways via the 'anywhere, anytime' (as long as it is now) possibilities of new forms of communication.

AB  - There is a growing understanding that the 'power' of information technology is as much about its ability to judiciously filter out some information streams, its ability to help us assimilate data and ease cognitive load, as it is about accessing new streams and accruing greater quantities of data. Powerful digital technologies are as much about selectivity as they are about speed, capacity, or sensitivity. It is in the midst of that popular recognition that the iPhone (and perhaps the Apple brand in general) has emerged as an icon. The conventional wisdom that it 'just works'—its interoperability and functional resilience, the intuitive design of its interface, its visual and tactile harmonies—ameliorates a gnawing mass anxiety rooted in complexity. It is all too easy to overlook that the iPhone is not just an apparatus but an assemblage, a nexus of social, institutional, and material relations 'made concrete.' What proportion of the cost of the iPhone (real or effective, externalized or otherwise) is incurred not in the labor of its production and design or the raw materials of its physical components but in its attendant 'intangibles'—licenses, intellectual property, storage capacity, and bandwidth? Does the widening gulf between our pedestrian experience of such devices and their arcane 'insides'—arguably, some of the very complexities they are designed to alleviate—warrant analytic or political concern? Further, what is the cultural significance of this 'iceberg' quality, the fact that a growing proportion of our everyday experience is opaque to the casual observer, residing 'beneath the surface' of lay scrutiny and held fast within a dense technosocial matrix? This chapter considers these questions through what in many ways is a quite traditional anthropological approach. In particular, the author analyzes three artifacts of digital culture and their realization within the iPhone and its users and principal competitors: the 'end-user licensing agreement,' or EULA; the coder-decoder, or 'codec'; and the 'application programming interface,' or API. Constituting wholly distinct facets of the typical 'digital multimedia device,' they serve to illustrate the social and political relevance of the immaterial and the opaque.

AB  - Objective: As a Web application for speech training, e-learning-based speech therapy (EST) is assumed to have potential for neurological patients who aim at independent speech training in their home environment. This article reports a case study of a patient with dysarthric speech due to Parkinson's disease (PD) who enrolled in a 4-week intensive speech training through EST. The primary goal was to investigate the feasibility and the potential efficacy of EST as a Web application for speech training in dysarthric patients with PD. Materials and Methods: The participant used EST, following a speech training program containing parts of the pitch limiting voice treatment for patients with PD. The feasibility of EST for independent speech training in the home environment was verified through a questionnaire. The questionnaire addressed the participant's individual experiences with EST as well as the extent of satisfaction with technological features of EST, the content of the speech training, and the suitability of the home training environment. The potential efficacy of EST as a device to improve speech intelligibility was investigated using a repeated measures with randomized blocks design. The proportion of correct orthographic transcriptions of semantically unpredictable sentences as well as ratings of perceived intelligibility on a 10-point scale were used as measures for speech intelligibility. Results: Outcomes of the questionnaire resulted in recommendations to enhance EST feasibility. Speech intelligibility, as measured by transcription scores, improved significantly after EST training. This improvement was maintained for 2 weeks after completing the EST training, whereas considerably lower scores were observed after 11 weeks without training. Subjective ratings of intelligibility did not show significant differences across time. Conclusions: The results of this case study confirm the potential of EST for patients with PD.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate a system—'the service'—designed to improve mobile telephone communication for people with hearing loss. Design: Each participant registered online and took an online hearing test using their own mobile telephone held in the position of their choice. The test assessed the combined effects of the telephone, the hearing loss of the participant and the hearing aid of the participant (if worn). The results were stored as a 'hearing profile' and used to set up frequency-dependent amplification and multichannel amplitude compression. The signal processing was performed in the telephone network and applied to all calls of the participant. Participants completed four questionnaires about their listening experiences using the telephone, one before using the service, two while using the service and one after using the service. Also, the ability to understand speech was measured using challenging sentences. Study sample: Fifty-three participants with varying degrees of hearing loss. Results: The great majority of participants indicated that call clarity was improved and that listening difficulty was reduced when using the service. Speech intelligibility scores were significantly improved when using the service. Conclusions: The service appears to be effective in improving phone communication for people with hearing loss.

AB  - Purpose: To assess the equivalence of patient-reported outcome (PRO) survey responses across Web, interactive voice response system (IVRS), and paper modes of administration. Methods: Postoperative colorectal cancer patients with home Web/e-mail and phone were randomly assigned to one of the eight study groups: Groups 1–6 completed the survey via Web, IVRS, and paper, in one of the six possible orders; Groups 7–8 completed the survey twice, either by Web or by IVRS. The 20-item survey, including the MSKCC Bowel Function Instrument (BFI), the LASA Quality of Life (QOL) scale, and the Subjective Significance Questionnaire (SSQ) adapted to bowel function, was completed from home on consecutive days. Mode equivalence was assessed by comparison of mean scores across modes and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and was compared to the test–retest reliability of Web and IVRS. Results: Of 170 patients, 157 completed at least one survey and were included in analysis. Patients had mean age 56 (SD = 11), 53 % were male, 81 % white, 53 % colon, and 47 % rectal cancer; 78 % completed all assigned surveys. Mean scores for BFI total score, BFI subscale scores, LASA QOL, and adapted SSQ varied by mode by less than one-third of a score point. ICCs across mode were: BFI total score (Web–paper = 0.96, Web–IVRS = 0.97, paper–IVRS = 0.97); BFI subscales (range = 0.88–0.98); LASA QOL (Web–paper = 0.98, Web–IVRS = 0.78, paper–IVRS = 0.80); and SSQ (Web–paper = 0.92, Web–IVRS = 0.86, paper–IVRS = 0.79). Conclusions: Mode equivalence was demonstrated for the BFI total score, BFI subscales, LASA QOL, and adapted SSQ, supporting the use of multiple modes of PRO data capture in clinical trials.

AB  - This paper presents an innovative multifaceted architecture, named energy-efficient framework for DTV broadcast over Wi-Fi networks (eWU-TV), that provides an energy efficient, user-centric, adaptive digital television (DTV) broadcast over Wi-Fi. To cater to the varied properties of the user equipments (UEs), the proposed framework broadcasts DTV content in the form of scalable video coded content that is adapted to suit the subscribers’ requirements. The user-centricity is in terms of UE device display size, user preferences for video quality profile based on device energy saving, and UE transmission technology support (DVB-T/H or Wi-Fi). Mathematical models on device battery discharge, quality of experience, and user preference are devised that closely approximate the results of device battery discharge experiments on DTV reception by heterogeneous devices over Wi-Fi/DVB-T, subjective video quality assessment study, and statistical survey of user preference. The proposed eWU-TV performance optimization framework is based on the developed models. The framework ensures that the adaptive scalable broadcast reception via Wi-Fi serves more number of users with higher quality of user experience and with provisions for significant device energy saving.

AB  - While iPads and other mobile devices are gaining popularity in educational settings, challenges associated with teachers’ use of technology continue to hold true. Preparing preservice teachers within teacher preparation programs to gain experience learning and teaching science using mobile technologies is critical for them to develop positive beliefs and self-efficacy for future technology integration. The purpose of this study was to investigate changes in preservice elementary teachers’ technology self-efficacy during their participation in a specialized science content course that utilized a mobile technology-based physics curriculum, Exploring Physics. The Exploring Physics curriculum is available as a hybrid online-offline application running on multiple platforms (iOS, Android, PC/Mac). Participants included 34 preservice elementary teachers who participated in pre- and post-implementation of a technology self-efficacy survey. Data sources also included two focus-group and individual interviews with six participants, weekly classroom observations, and artifacts. Results showed significant positive changes in participants’ technology self-efficacy regarding the use of mobile technologies in science teaching. Factors that supported participants’ technology self-efficacy included: (a) firsthand experiences with iPads, (b) enhanced science content understandings, (c) high interactivity and engagement, and (c) instructor modeling the use of technology. Findings have implications for preservice teacher preparation for technology integration in science teaching. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This paper furthers our understanding of online customer support with regard to online live chat systems. Online live chat systems allow customers to seek service related information from an organisation via online-based synchronous media with a human service representative who provides answers through such media. With use of a web-based survey involving 302 respondents of real-life live chat service experiences with mobile phone network providers in the UK and through the use of structural equation modelling, the aim of this research is to understand the variables capable of influencing a customer's satisfaction with their experience during an online live chat service encounter. The results indicate the importance of service quality, information quality and system quality variables influencing satisfaction with the experience, while such influence is dependent on the purpose of use. Additionally, the results outline the role of emoticons, presence of service reps picture, automated ‘canned’ responses and the presence of response time estimations in moderating the influence of service quality, information quality and system quality variables on satisfaction with the experience.

AB  - The proportion of web survey responses submitted from mobile devices such as smartphones is increasing steadily. This trend presents new methodological challenges because mobile responses are often associated with increased breakoffs, which, in turn, can increase nonresponse bias. Using data from a survey of college students with more than 20,000 respondents, response patterns are examined to identify which days and times the survey invitation and reminder emails were most likely to produce nonmobile responses. The findings provide guidance on the optimal timing for recruiting college student sample members via email to reduce their likelihood of responding from a mobile device, and potentially, breaking off.

AB  - Background The digitalisation of literature is proliferating, and the increasing spread of digital reading devices and the availability of digital texts is likely to make books on screen a lasting phenomenon, but little attention has been paid to the consequences of digitalisation for the experience of narrative fiction. While on the one hand, reading literature on a digital reading device might trigger a superficial processing of the text, and problems regarding orientation within the narrative, the awareness of reading a literary text might, on the other hand, lead to more in‐depth and complex processing, independent of reading medium. This study examines whether the reading performance and the emotional and cognitive experiences of the reception of a literary text vary between reading a printed book or an e‐reader. Methods Using a between‐subjects experimental design, 207 participants read the beginning of a novel either in a printed book or on an e‐reader. They then completed a reading comprehension test and questionnaires about their cognitive and emotional experiences. Results Overall, the results do not suggest the clear superiority of either of the two reading media. Neither reading speed nor reading comprehension differed significantly between the two groups. Even though a broad range of reading experiences was measured, neither cognitive nor emotional reading experiences differed significantly between the groups. Conclusion An e‐reader does not affect either reading performance or cognitive and emotional experience of reading a narrative text, compared with a printed book.

AB  - Smartphones have become very popular globally, and smartphone ownership has overtaken conventional cell phone ownership in many countries in recent years. With this rapid rise in smartphone penetration, researchers are looking at ways to conduct web surveys using smartphones. This is particularly true of student populations where smartphone penetration is very high and web surveys are already the norm. However, researchers are raising concerns about selection biases and measurement differences between PC and smartphone respondents. Questions also remain about comparisons to traditional interviewer-administered approaches. We designed an experimental comparison between a PC web survey, a smartphone web survey and a computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) survey. This study was conducted using an annual survey of students at a large university in South Korea. The CATI (interviewer-administered) survey had a higher response rate, lower margins of error, and better representation of the student population than the two web (self-administered) modes, but at a higher cost. The CATI survey also had lower rates of item nonresponse. More significant differences were found between the modes for sensitive questions than for nonsensitive ones. This suggests that CATI surveys may still have a role to play in surveys of college students, even in a country with high rates of mobile technology adoption.

AB  - Interview duration is an important variable in web surveys because it is a direct measure of the response burden. In this article, we analyze the effects of the survey design, respondent characteristics, and the interaction between these effects on interview duration. For that purpose, we applied multilevel analysis to a data set of 21 web surveys on political attitudes and behavior. Our results showed that factors on both levels, the individual and the survey level, had effects on interview duration. However, the larger share of the variation in interview duration is explained by the characteristics of the respondents. In this respect, we illustrate the impact of mobile devices and panel recruitment on interview duration. In addition, we found important relationships between the respondents’ attitudes and how a web survey is designed: Highly motivated respondents spent significantly more time answering cognitively demanding questions than less motivated respondents. When planning a survey, not only the number and formats of questions need to be taken into account but also the expected sample composition and how the participants will respond to the design of the web survey.

AB  - This chapter explains how data-mining-based techniques can be used to discover interesting knowledge from sequences of life events, that is, to find out how people sequence important life events. We illustrate with data from the biographical survey conducted by the Swiss Household Panel in 2002. The focus is on the sequencing of events in the occupational life course and of events, such as starting a union and childbirth, that affect living arrangements. Addressed methods include finding of frequent sequential patterns, identification of discriminant subsequences, and clustering of event sequences. Mining of sequentially organized data has been successfully exploited in many domains such as genetics, device control, and speech recognition as well as for automatic text, customer behavior, and web logs analysis. In the social sciences sequence exploration mainly focuses on state sequences, and consists typically of building typologies by means of the optimal matching approach. In contrast, we focus in this chapter on event sequences rather than state sequences. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Decades of research emphasize that information alone rarely influences environmental behavior. We addressed the question of, 'what, then, does influence environmental behavior?' by asking more specifically: what factors mediate the relationship between learning about environmentally related issues and engaging in environmentally related behaviors? Following Yin’s case study approach, we designed a California (USA)-based case study focused on four everyday-life activities: purchasing food, commuting, engaging in leisure activities, and interacting with mobile technology. We grounded the study in four propositions that previous sociological, psychological, and learning sciences research suggested might influence learning–behavior connections in complex everyday-life contexts. To address the propositions across the four cases, we conducted 197 short, semi-structured interviews grounded in a narrative, relational frame. Using thematic content analysis, we found support for three of our propositions as mediators of learning–behavior connections; we also uncovered two emergent themes. Our findings suggest a web of elements that affect learning–behavior connections; those elements offer insights for environmentally related programming.

AB  - Handsets are being transformed from the traditional cellular phone to an integrated content delivery platform for communications. Their increasing capabilities and value-added features provide more utilities, and at the same time, make the design more complicated and the devices more difficult to use. The objective of this study was to explore and identify the critical factors that predicate the handset's perceived usability. An online survey was conducted by using a seven-point Likert-scale structured questionnaire tailored to measure the user's perception of the usability level of their current handset. A total of nine usability dimensions were derived from the results of exploratory factor analysis. The total variance explained by these nine factors was 65.20% of the overall variance of the data. Relationships between the nine usability factors and handset design features were described by regression models. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Reports an error in 'Exploring digital creativity in the workspace: The role of enterprise mobile applications on perceived job performance and creativity' by Sunghun Chung, Kyung Young Lee and Jinho Choi (Computers in Human Behavior, 2015[Jan], Vol 42, 93-109). In the original article, the affiliation was incorrectly listed in for Sunghun Chung. The correction affiliation is present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2014-13933-001[/rid]). This study examines enterprise mobile applications (EMA) to explain how creative job performance is revealed from both the habitual use and task-technology fit for EMA, while also considering the moderating effect of organizational agility. Based on a large-scale survey from employees who use EMA in their workplace across industries, our results suggest that the impact of EMA on perceived job performance and creativity as creativity-supporting systems (in terms of both the habitual use and task-technology fit for EMA) is positive and significant. Our results indicate the positive moderating effect of organizational agility on the relationship between task-technology fit for EMA and perceived job performance. We also identify task-(mobility and feedback) and technology-(reliability, accessibility, and overall quality) characteristics that are found to be positively associated with task-technology fit for EMA. Further, we find that external factors, such as perceived critical mass and the reputation of EMA, can more efficiently explain the habitual use of EMA than internal factors, such as trust and self-efficacy for EMA. The present findings enable researchers and practitioners to understand the role of EMA, which facilitates organizational workers’ creative work processes, as well as it inspires the exploration of digital creativity in the workplace.

AB  - Despite the growing importance of the online mobile gaming industry, little research has been undertaken to explain why consumers engage in this ubiquitous entertainment. This study attempts to develop an instrument to measure experiential value in online mobile gaming adoption. The proposed scale consists of seven first-order factors of experiential value: intrinsic enjoyment, escapism, efficiency, economic value, visual appeal, perceived novelty, and perceived risklessness. The survey obtained 164 usable responses from Japanese college students. The empirical data fit our first-order model well, indicating a high level of reliability as well as convergent and discriminant validity. The single second-order model also shows an acceptable model fit. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Support groups provide opportunities for participants to express and get in touch with their feelings and emotions. For children such groups provide a non-threatening environment in which they can share their feelings and concerns openly with one another. The wide range of social networking options made easily accessible via mobile technologies has seen children increasingly connecting with their peers in search of emotional support. For parents and professionals alike the question arises as to whether these online groups provide the positive support environment necessary to ensure children feel comfortable sharing their emotional concerns. In this study qualitative content analysis of the communications shared between the young members of an online support group for siblings of children with special needs revealed that participants felt confident to openly express a range of strong feelings and emotions, including hate, love, confusion, hurt, fear, jealousy and embarrassment.

AB  - This paper aims to examine the effects of important determinants such as ubiquitous connection, context-aware, reputation and familiarity on consumers' purchase intention by the path of trust and social benefit in mobile commerce. Data were collected from an online survey system. The formal questionnaire consisted of two sections. Section 1 measured respondent perceptions of each construct in the research model. Section 2 aimed to understand respondent basic personal data. The study results indicate that both trust and social can positively influence purchase intention in mobile commerce. Ubiquitous connection and familiarity fail to influence trust directly but can influence purchase intention by the path of social benefit as expected. The research extends the literature on consumers' purchase intention identifying the importance of ubiquitous connection, context-aware, reputation and familiarity and probing into the relationship of trust, social benefit and purchase intention. The results suggest prescriptive strategies for mobile commerce sellers. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Users acceptance of innovative product appearance authoring tools based on Spatial Augmented Reality (SAR) is still limited due to their perception of a high technology complexity and a low performance/functionality of the current interaction systems. The integration of SAR technologies in professional design activities is still marginal, though many studies in this field have already proved their potential as supporting tools. To overcome this barrier, efficient means for interacting with the digital images projected onto the surfaces of real objects are essential. The aim of the current study is to respond to this demand by proposing and validating three UI configurations displayed by an unique and portable device embedded with a touch screen. These interface layouts, designed to cooperate with the output of the SAR system and to not affect the well-known benefits of its augmented environment, provide different types of visual feedback to the user by duplicating, extending or hiding the information already displayed by the projected mock-up. The experimental study reported here, performed with a panel of 41 subjects, revealed that accuracy, efficiency and perceived usability of the proposed solutions are comparable with each other and in comparison to standard desktop setups commonly used for design activities. According to these findings, the research simultaneously demonstrates (i) the high performances achieved by the touch device when coupled with a SAR system during the execution of authoring tasks, (ii) the capability of the projected mock-up to behave as an actual three-dimensional display for the real time rendering of the product appearance and (iii) the possibility to freely select—according to the users preference, the design task or the type of product—one of the three UI configurations without affecting the quality of the result.

AB  - What does children's play look like in the smart toy era? What conceptual frameworks help make sense of the changing practices of children's connected play worlds? Responding to these questions, this article re-frames discussions about children's smart toy play within wider theoretical debates about the affordances of new digital materialities. To understand recent transformations of children's play practices, we propose it is necessary to think of toys as increasingly media-like in their affordances and as connected to wider digital material ecosystems. To demonstrate the potential of this conceptual approach, we explore illustrative examples of two popular smart 'care toys'. Our analysis identifies three examples of affordances that smart care toys share with other forms of mobile and robotic media: liveliness, affective stickiness and portability. We argue that locating discussions of smart toys within wider conceptual debates about digital materialities can provide new insights into the changing landscape of children's play.

AB  - With the rapid development of mobile communications technologies, social apps (e.g., Line, WeChat) have emerged as important communication tools. Although social apps provide people with additional convenience, overuse of such applications may have negative life effects, such as technostress and distraction. Past research has indicated that personality attributes contribute to compulsive usage. This study explores the relationships between personality attributes and compulsive usage of social apps, and examines the impact of technostress on academic performance. A total of 136 valid questionnaires were collected from university students through an online survey. Fourteen proposed hypotheses were examined using SmartPLS software. The results indicate that extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism have significant effects on compulsive usage of mobile social applications. Compulsive usage had a significant positive impact on technostress but did not negatively affect academic self-perception and course grades. In addition, conscientiousness significantly influenced academic self-perception. Unexpectedly, gender and number of friends had little influence on technostress or compulsive usage. The implications of these findings are discussed and directions for future research are offered. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study examined interventions with parents/carers in child and adolescent counselling and psychotherapy (CAP). The aim was to investigate clinicians' rationale behind their decision to work with parents and what types of interventions they use. Furthermore, the nature of clinicians' core training with regard to interventions with parents was investigated. The study used both quantitative data and qualitative textual data from an online survey of 110 CAP clinicians. There was significant agreement, regardless of previous training or level of experience, that clinical work with parents in CAP is beneficial, but little consensus for a rationale or model for best practice. There was a relationship between training, theoretical orientation and whether CAPs felt competent to work with parents. Unexpectedly, a significant number (83%) of integrative practitioners said that there had been ‘little’ to ‘none at all’ focus on working with parents on their core training course. Other unforeseen findings were in the domain of working outside generally accepted boundaries for CAP, with a notable number of clinicians making home visits—24.1% with parents alone and 38.9% with parent and child together—along with 47.2% using phone calls and/or email for coaching and support with parents. Many clinicians were candid about their sense of a lack of competence in working with parents, even though at least half were senior, experienced clinicians. A number of these practitioners made specific reference to the wish for further specialist training, with many asking for signposting to where further training could be obtained.

AB  - The experience sampling method (ESM) is a structured diary method with high ecological validity, in that it accurately captures the everyday context of individuals through repeated measurements in naturalistic environments. Our main objective was to investigate the feasibility of using ESM in individuals with acquired brain injury (ABI). A second goal was to explore the usability of ESM data on a clinical level, by illustrating the interactions between person, environment, and affect. The PsyMate device provided ABI patients (N = 17) with ten signals (beeps) per day during six consecutive days. Each beep was followed by a digital questionnaire assessing mood, location, activities, social context, and physical well-being. Results demonstrated high feasibility with a 71% response rate and a 99% completion rate of the questionnaires. There were no dropouts and the method was experienced as user-friendly. Time-lagged multilevel analysis showed that higher levels of physical activity and fatigue predicted higher levels of negative affect at the same point in time, but not at later time points. This study illustrates the potential of ESM to identify complex person–environment dynamics after ABI, while generating understandable and easy to use graphical feedback.

AB  - The last several decades have been characterized by the widespread usage of digital devices, especially smartphones. At the same time, there have been reports of both decline in sleep duration and quality and male fertility decline. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between evening exposure to the light-emitting screens of digital media devices and measures of both sleep and sperm quality. Semen samples were obtained from 116 men undergoing fertility evaluation for the following sperm variables: volume (mL), pH, sperm concentration (million/mL), motility percentage (progressive% + non-progressive motility%), and total sperm count. Exposure to the screens of electronic devices and sleep habits was obtained by means of a questionnaire. Smartphone and tablet usage in the evening and after bedtime was negatively correlated with sperm motility (−0.392; −0.369; p < .05), sperm progressive motility (−0.322; −0.299; p < .05), and sperm concentration (−0.169; p < .05), and positively correlated with the percentage of immotile sperm (0.382; 0.344; p < .05). In addition, sleep duration was positively correlated with sperm total and progressive motility (0.249; 0.233; p < .05) and negatively correlated with semen pH (−0.349; p < .05). A significant negative correlation was observed between subjective sleepiness and total and progressive motility (−0.264; p < .05) as well as total motile sperm number (−0.173; p < .05). The results of this study support a link between evening and post-bedtime exposure to light-emitting digital media screens and sperm quality. Further research is required to establish the proposed causative link and may lead to the future development of relevant therapeutic and lifestyle interventions.

AB  - The growing role that information and communication technologies (ICTs) play in everyday interactions should not be understood as constituting a special realm of exchange, separated from or concurrent to face-to-face interpersonal interactions. Rather, we see in this process a set of small but significant displacements inside a larger relational system. Thus, we need to approach the multifaceted dialectic between ICT usages and individual relational resources by examining the incorporation of communication tools into everyday life practices. To analyze the interweaving of ICTs and sociability, we combine various datasets: individual questionnaires, telephone and Internet traffic measures, and qualitative studies. Our analysis is based on a statistically representative panel study of 2,370 French individuals, which ran in 2005 and 2006, and articulated different data sources by mixing different research techniques: (1) detailed mobile and fixed telephone communication data from billing records; (2) home computer usage data, collected via a software installed on the panelists' computers, and providing individual-level data on Web, mail, and global PC activity; and (3) phone and paper questionnaires, administrated periodically all along the eighteen months of observation. We mobilize these three data sources together with a specific contact diary study performed with a selected subsample of ten households where all the members were interviewed in depth about their social practices and networks (for more details on our research methodology, see Smoreda et al., 2007). We will first analyze the scope of the interweaving of various voice and text communication tools that mobilize telephony, short message service (SMS), instant messenger (IM), and/or e-mail as well as the factors behind their usage. By looking at the intensity of usage and the various means of communication, we will see how five different usage profiles organize actual communication tools into differentiated patterns. Second, we will analyze how age cohorts structure the equipment penetration rate as well as the trade-offs between communication tools between generations. Finally, we will examine the interweaving of tools and relations spread over various social networks and the local negotiation in family and marital logics to emphasize the role of family socialization frameworks in ICT usage.

AB  - Mild traumatic brain injury does not currently have a clear molecular diagnostic panel to either confirm the injury or to guide its treatment. Current biomarkers for traumatic brain injury rely mainly on detecting circulating proteins in blood that are associated with degenerating neurons, which are less common in mild traumatic brain injury, or with broad inflammatory cascades which are produced in multiple tissues and are thus not brain specific. To address this issue, we conducted an observational cohort study designed to measure a protein panel in two compartments—plasma and brain-derived extracellular vesicles—with the following hypotheses: (i) each compartment provides independent diagnostic information and (ii) algorithmically combining these compartments accurately classifies clinical mild traumatic brain injury. We evaluated this hypothesis using plasma samples from mild (Glasgow coma scale scores 13–15) traumatic brain injury patients (n = 47) and healthy and orthopaedic control subjects (n = 46) to evaluate biomarkers in brain-derived extracellular vesicles and plasma. We used our Track Etched Magnetic Nanopore technology to isolate brain-derived extracellular vesicles from plasma based on their expression of GluR2, combined with the ultrasensitive digital enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, Single-Molecule Array. We quantified extracellular vesicle-packaged and plasma levels of biomarkers associated with two categories of traumatic brain injury pathology: neurodegeneration and neuronal/glial damage (ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1, glial fibrillary acid protein, neurofilament light and Tau) and inflammation (interleukin-6, interleukin-10 and tumour necrosis factor alpha). We found that GluR2+ extracellular vesicles have distinct biomarker distributions than those present in the plasma. As a proof of concept, we showed that using a panel of biomarkers comprised of both plasma and GluR2+ extracellular vesicles, injured patients could be accurately classified versus non-injured patients. Graphical Abstract Graphical Abstract Abbreviated summary Beard et al. report that circulating brain-derived extracellular vesicles captured using a novel nanofluidic device contain distinct molecular information from conventional plasma biomarkers of traumatic brain injury. They demonstrate that algorithmically combining biomarkers from both compartments may provide a clinically useful, information-rich method of classifying brain injury.

AB  - In four survey experiments we show that people generally answer more extremely to survey items presented in vertical versus horizontal Likert formats. Our findings suggest that this effect may be at least partly driven by differences in the visual range spanned by the response scale (i.e. the visual distance between endpoint response categories is larger in horizontal than in a vertical format). In addition, compared to traditional horizontal Likert data, vertical Likert data contain more variance, which is mainly non-substantive. As a result, data obtained with scale formats that have different distances between response categories (as is typically the case for vertical vs. horizontal formats) may lead to differences in measurement model parameter estimates like residual terms, and in some cases factor loadings and construct correlations. Based on these results, we provide recommendations on the use of response scale formats in online surveys, bearing in mind that several online survey tool providers promote the use of vertical Likert formats and even automatically change traditional horizontal formats of Likert-type items to vertical Likert formats when viewed on small screens (e.g., on mobile phones).

AB  - Although Mobile Instant Messaging (MIM) is a massive communication phenomenon and its educational use can be seen as a genuine form of mobile learning, it has been studied to a limited extent to date. The present study examined the use of MIM to engage young professionals in mobile learning communities during their school-to-work transition. This transition is one of the most central but also challenging developmental phases marked by the experience of knowledge gaps and a lack of belonging. To assess knowledge and socio-professional learning effects associated with the use of MIM, this study adopted a quasi-experimental, survey-based approach with an intervention and control condition (n = 114) in the setting of an international research project. In the intervention condition, newly graduated nurses from Nigeria participated in WhatsApp groups in which moderators shared knowledge and stimulated professional discussions over a period of 6 months. Data were collected via online surveys and knowledge tests. The findings show that participants in the moderated WhatsApp groups had significantly higher knowledge and exhibited fewer feelings of professional isolation compared with the control group, which was not subject of any treatment. The effects were even more pronounced when controlling for active contributions (writing vs reading messages), which also amounted to significantly higher levels of professional identification. In addition, across intervention and control groups, the self-reported general active use of WhatsApp (outside of the intervention) was positively associated with the measures of professional social capital maintained with school connections, professional identity, (lower) professional isolation, job satisfaction, and the perceived transfer of school knowledge to work practice. Whereas knowledge and socio-professional effects can be triggered through moderated WhatsApp interventions yet the general (and thus informal) use of WhatsApp is associated with socio-professional connectedness. The findings are of particular relevance in the developing context under investigation, which is marked by a lack of alternative support structures.

AB  - This article compares the factors affecting completion times (CTs) to web survey questions when they are answered using two different devices: personal computers (PCs) and smartphones. Several studies have reported longer CTs when respondents use smartphones than PCs. This is a concern to survey researchers because longer CTs may increase respondent burden and the risk of breakoff. However, few studies have analyzed the specific reasons for the time difference. In this analysis, we analyzed timing data from 836 respondents who completed the same web survey twice, once using a smartphone and once using PC, as part of a randomized crossover experiment in the Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences panel. The survey contained a mix of questions (single choice, numeric entry, and text entry) that were displayed on separate pages. We included both page-level and respondent-level factors that may have contributed to the time difference between devices in cross-classified multilevel models. We found that respondents took about 1.4 times longer when using smartphones than PCs. This difference was larger when a page had more than one question or required text entry. The difference was also larger among respondents who had relatively low levels of familiarity and experience using smartphones. Respondent multitasking was associated with slower CTs, regardless of the device used. Practical implications and avenues for future research are discussed.

AB  - Introduction: Electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) are becoming increasingly popular but little is known about how e-cig users’ transition between the different device types and what device characteristics and preferences may influence the transition. Methods: Four thousand four hundred twenty-one experienced e-cig users completed an online survey about their e-cig use, devices, and preferences. Participants included in analysis were ever cigarette smokers who used an e-cig at least 30 days in their lifetime and who reported the type of their first and current e-cig device and the nicotine concentration of their liquid. Analyses focused on transitions between 'first generation' devices (same size as a cigarette with no button) and 'advanced generation' devices (larger than a cigarette with a manual button) and differences between current users of each device type. Results: Most e-cig users (n = 2603, 58.9%) began use with a first generation device, and of these users, 63.7% subsequently transitioned to current use of an advanced generation device. Among users who began use with an advanced generation device (n = 1818, 41.1%), only 5.7% transitioned to a first generation device. Seventy-seven percent of current advanced generation e-cig users switched to their current device in order to obtain a 'more satisfying hit.' Battery capabilities and liquid flavor choices also influenced device choice. Conclusion: E-cig users commonly begin use with a device shaped like a cigarette and transition to a larger device with a more powerful battery, a button for manual activation and a wider choice of liquid flavors.

AB  - The aim was to better understand structural factors associated with uptake of automated tailored interventions for smoking cessation. In a prospective randomized controlled trial with interventions only offered, not mandated, participants were randomized based on the following: web-based expert system (QuitCoach); text-messaging program (onQ); both as an integrated package; the choice of using either or both; or a control condition informed of a static website (not considered here). Participants were 3530 smokers or recent quitters recruited from two sources; those seeking smoking cessation information, mostly recruited over the phone, and a cold-contacted group recruited from an Internet panel. More participants (60.1%) initially accepted the intervention they had been offered than used it (42.5%). Uptake of each intervention differed substantially by both recruitment source and modality (phone or web). onQ was a little more popular overall, especially in the information seeker sample. Highest overall intervention uptake occurred in the choice condition. A web-based intervention is most attractive if the offer to use is made by web, whereas a phone-based intervention is more likely to be used if the offer is made over the phone. Providing automated interventions on multiple platforms allows for maximal choice and greatest overall use of some form of help. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study developed and empirically tested a model to predict the factors affecting students’ behavioral intentions toward using mobile learning (m-learning). This study explored the behavioral intention to use m-learning from the perspective of consumers by applying the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model with the addition of perceived enjoyment, mobile self-efficacy, satisfaction, trust, and perceived risk moderators. A cross-sectional study was conducted by employing a research model based on multiple technology acceptance theories. Data were derived from an online survey with 1,562 respondents and analyzed using structural equation modeling. Partial least squares (PLS) regression was used for model and hypothesis testing. The results revealed that (1) behavioral intention was significantly and positively influenced by satisfaction, trust, performance expectancy, and effort expectancy; (2) perceived enjoyment, performance expectancy, and effort expectancy had positive associations with behavioral intention; (3) mobile self-efficacy had a significantly positive effect on perceived enjoyment; and (4) perceived risk had a significantly negative moderating effect on the relationship between performance expectancy and behavioral intention. Our findings correspond with the UTAUT model and provide a practical reference for educational institutions and decision-makers involved in designing m-learning for implementation in universities.

AB  - The identification of factors that affect people's continuous use of e-books on their mobile devices is critical for e-book publishers, e-reader manufacturers and academic researchers. This study proposes a research model that extends the expectation-confirmation model by incorporating perceived enjoyment and facilitating conditions to get a deeper understanding of continuance intention to use e-books in the mobile environment. The structural equation model (SEM) was used to analyse data which were collected from 1,663 e-book readers by an online survey. The results indicate that satisfaction, perceived enjoyment, perceived usefulness and facilitating conditions influence continuance intention significantly. Furthermore, users' confirmation of expectations has a positive effect on perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment and satisfaction. Surprisingly, perceived usefulness does not have a significant effect on satisfaction.

AB  - The current study examined how task performance enhancement, easiness, important others' opinions, entertainment motivation, information seeking motivation, and social connection motivation would predict use intention of mobile applications. Based on a motivational communication theory and the technology acceptance model, a web-based survey was administered among mobile application users. The results of hypothesised model testing show that easiness is the key factor influencing continuance intention of mobile application use. In addition, this study reveals that mobile application users consider human connection and social utility to be more important than entertainment in creating task performance, easiness, social influence, and use intention. This study combined motivations with technology adoption factors for mobile application use in an integrated model. This theoretical attempt strengthened the explanatory power of the technology adoption model for mobile application use. Mobile application vendors and developers must consider the user friendliness of their applications and how many purposes they satisfy. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - With the growing popularity of smartphones and tablets, the number of people who use wireless internet, including mobile internet, reached 11 million in 2013. The number of m-commerce services and applications used by customers in Taiwan is still small. This study aims to investigate the factors that predict users' behavioural intention to adopt m-commerce in Taiwan. It is based on the revised Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology model (UTAUT), and two of Hofstede's cultural dimensions (power distance and uncertainty avoidance) as moderators on the UTAUT model to enhance the understanding of influencing users' intention of using m-commerce. The study sample surveyed with online questionnaires consists of 435 valid respondents. The research result shows that effort expectation, performance expectation, social influence and trust significantly influence the behavioural intention to use m-commerce. For moderator effects, power distance has an interacting effect with social influence, and has a negative relationship with social influence on behavioural intention to use m-commerce.

AB  - We examined the relationships between the determinants that affect customers’ use of food delivery apps. Using an extended technology acceptance model, we explored consumers’ experiences in purchasing delivery food through mobile apps. We distributed a self-administered questionnaire online and used structural equation modeling to test the hypotheses. We found that user-generated information, firm-generated information, and system quality had a significant effect on perceived usefulness. In addition, system quality and design quality strongly influenced the perceived ease of use, which improved perceived usefulness, and in turn, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use affected attitude toward the use of mobile apps. Practical implications for the food service industry are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - As an over-the-top (OTT) and non-subscription-based video-on-demand media service, mobile short-form video application (e.g., TikTok or Douyin) is a free video-sharing social networking service (SNS) distributing short-form video content to smartphones, smart TVs, and tablets. This study investigates the roles of gratifications-sought, narcissism, and personality traits in TikTok engagement behaviors (i.e., contribution, enhancement, and creation) in China. Data were gathered from a sample of 526 TikTok users through an online questionnaire survey in 2020. Factor analysis confirmed nine gratifications sought: escape, fashion, entertainment, information seeking, money making, sociability seeking, navigability, modality, and interactivity. In particular, extraverts and people with the quality of being vain were most active in the contributing, enhancing, and creating TikTok engagement behaviors. The results also show that exhibitionists and people who are more open to new experiences were found to create more, while narcissists with an attitude of entitlement also engaging strongly in giving likes, commenting, forwarding TikToks, and following others. Theoretical and practical implications are also discussed. • Explored how gratifications-sought, narcissism, and personality traits influence use intensity and usage patterns of TikTok. • Interactivity, modality, navigability, entertainment, entitlement in narcissism, and age were related to TikTok use. • Extraverts and those to be vain were most active in the contribution, enhancement, and creation functions. • Exhibitionists and people who are more open to new experiences would engage more. • Narcissists with an attitude of entitlement reacted strongly in giving likes, commenting, forwarding, and following others.

AB  - Teachers' role can be catalytic in the introduction of innovative digital tools in order to create new learning and assessment opportunities. This study explores science technology engineering and mathematics (STEM) teachers' intention to use mobile‐based assessments in the teaching practice. The study proposes the teachers' acceptance mobile‐based assessment (TAMBA) model which extends the technology acceptance model by introducing individual, social, institutional and instructional design factors. An appropriate questionnaire was developed and answered by 161 STEM teachers from 32 European countries. Their responses were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The proposed TAMBA model explains about 50% of the variance in teachers' intention to adopt mobile‐based assessment. Perceived Ease of Use was found to be the most important determinant in teachers' intention to use mobile‐based assessment. Facilitating Conditions and Output Quality were the most influential external variables in the model. The study findings revealed that focusing on mobile assessment quality design as well as on institutional support are important factors for STEM teachers in order to accept mobile‐based assessments in schools.

AB  - This study investigated whether any of seven factors of family dysfunction predicted five risk factors for developing eating disorders in young adult women. Participants completed demographic questions, the McMaster Family Assessment Device (Epstein, Baldwin, & Bishop, 1983) and the Setting Conditions for Anorexia Nervosa Scale (Slade & Dewey, 1986) online. Five stepwise multiple regressions evaluated whether FAD scores predicted any of the eating disorder risk factors. Unhealthy affective responsiveness predicted general dissatisfaction and social and personal anxiety, and unhealthy general functioning predicted adolescent problems. No FAD factors predicted perfectionism or weight control. These results confirm the importance of families' affective responsiveness and general functioning to the risk of developing eating disorders. However, the lack of relationship among problem-solving, communication, roles, affective involvement, or behavior control with any of the risk factors for eating disorders warrants further investigation.

AB  - Background: A nationwide survey of family members of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities ranging in age from birth through adulthood was conducted to replicate a similar effort by Wehmeyer and update the knowledge base concerning technology use by people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Method: Survey responses provided information about use of technology for mobility, hearing and vision, communication, independent living, and in the area of computer use. In addition, survey items queried the use of electronic and information technology devices such as use of email, mobile telephones and digital cameras. Results: Survey results showed that although the use of computers for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities is more prevalent, other technology use frequency is much the same as in the late 1990s. However, technology needs did vary among school-age individuals over time. Conclusion: Implications of results for technology use of people with disabilities are discussed through the lens of frequency of use and needs for individuals with disabilities.

AB  - We argue that the usage of mobile apps could be understood in the context of being permanently online. That is, contrary to functionalist theories, the usage of mobile apps is not simply an outcome based on the user's rational needs and goals but also reflects the new state of being in the online world of the mobile Internet environment. Following this approach, in this study we review the emerging concept of being permanently online, as well as two key influential factors: the fear of missing out (FOMO) and the feeling of acceleration. We then use the survey data collected from university students in Shanghai, China (N = 687) to examine the relationships between FOMO, the feeling of acceleration, being permanently online, and two types of mobile apps usage (i.e. WeChat and O2O life service apps). The results showed that in controlling for other variables, FOMO, the feeling of acceleration, and being permanently online were significantly related to mobile apps usage. In particular, FOMO was positively related to being permanently online. These empirical findings demonstrate the significance of examining mobile app usage from a new theoretical perspective, and they indicate that this approach deserves further attention in the research on this topic.

AB  - This study was done in preparation for the launch of the National Children’s Study (NCS) main study. The goal of this study was to examine the feasibility (completion rates and completeness of data), acceptability, staff time and cost-effectiveness of three methods of data collection for the postnatal 3- and 9-month questionnaires completed as part of NCS protocol. Eligible NCS participants who were scheduled to complete a postnatal questionnaire at three and nine months were randomly assigned to receive either: (a) telephone data collection (b) web-based data collection, or (c) self-administered (mailed) questionnaires. Event completion rates and satisfaction across the three data collection methods were compared and the influence of socio-demographic factors on completion rates and satisfaction rates was examined. Cost data were compared to data for completion and satisfaction for each of the delivery methods. Completion rates and satisfaction did not differ significantly by method, but completeness of data did, with odds of data completeness higher among web than phone (p < 0.001) or mail (p < 0.001). Costs were highest for the phone, followed by mail and web methods (p < 0.001). No significant differences in participant time (i.e. burden) across the three data collection methods were seen. Mail and phone data collection were the least complete of the three methods and were the most expensive. Mailed data collection was neither complete nor exceptionally economical. Web-based data collection was the least costly and provided the most complete data. Participants without web access could complete the questionnaire over the phone.

AB  - Ziel Für die diätetische Beurteilung können mobile Geräte mit einer Kamera als Alternative zu handgeschriebenen Papieraufzeichnungen verwendet werden. Die Nutritional Tracking Information Smartphone (Nutris-Phone)-Studie zielte darauf ab, die relative Validität und Machbarkeit einer fotobasierten Ernährungsaufzeichnung im Alltag zu untersuchen. Design Parallel zu der fotobasierten Technik wurde eine gewogene Aufzeichnung durchgeführt. Die Zufriedenheit der Teilnehmer wurde mittels eines Fragebogens ermittelt. Ein ausgebildeter Ernährungswissenschaftler bewertete die Portionsgrößen und der Nährstoffgehalt wurde berechnet (DGExpert). Spearman-Korrelation und Bland-Altman-Analysen wurden angewandt. Setting Gesunde, nicht schwangere Freiwillige (>= 18 Jahre) ohne Abnehmabsicht, rekrutiert an der Universität Ulm, Deutschland. Probanden Sechsundsechzig Teilnehmerinnen (36 % Männer, Medianalter 22 Mittelpunkt 0 (Interquartilbereich 20 Mittelpunkt 0-25 Mittelpunkt 0) Jahre) fotografierten mit einem handelsüblichen Mobiltelefon konsumierte Lebensmittel und Getränke. Ergebnisse Signifikante Korrelation zwischen der fotobasierten und der gewogenen Aufzeichnung wurde beobachtet: Energie (r=0 Zentralpunkt 991), Kohlenhydrate (r=0 Zentralpunkt 980), Fett (r=0 Zentralpunkt 972), Protein (r=0 Zentralpunkt 988), Ballaststoffe (r=0 Zentralpunkt 941). Bland-Altman-Analysen ergaben vergleichbare Mittelwerte und akzeptable 95 % Übereinstimmungsgrenzen (Energie: -345 Zentralpunkt 2 bis 302 Zentralpunkt 9 kJ (-82 Zentralpunkt 5 bis 72 Zentralpunkt 4 kcal); Kohlenhydrat: -15 Zentralpunkt 2 bis 13 Zentralpunkt 1 g; Fett: -6 Zentralpunkt 4 bis 6 Zentralpunkt 4 g; Protein: -5 Zentralpunkt 9 bis 5 Zentralpunkt 6 g; Ballaststoffe: -2 Zentralpunkt 7 bis 2 Zentralpunkt 5 g). Mit zunehmender Aufnahmemenge lag jedoch eine Unterschätzung durch die digitale Methode vor (mit Ausnahme von Fett, alle P<0 Zentralpunkt 01). Über 80 % der Teilnehmer waren mit der fotobasierten Aufzeichnung zufrieden. Bei fast 90 % war die technische Umsetzung ohne größere Probleme. Schlussfolgerungen Im Vergleich zu einer gewogenen Aufzeichnung scheint die fotobasierte Ernährungsaufzeichnung valide, durchführbar und benutzerfreundlich zu sein, um die Energie-, Makronährstoff- und Ballaststoffzufuhr abzuschätzen, wobei jedoch eine systematische Verzerrung mit zunehmender Zufuhrmenge zu berücksichtigen ist.

AB  - Objective For dietary assessment, mobile devices with a camera can be used as an alternative to hand-written paper records. The Nutritional Tracking Information Smartphone (Nutris-Phone) study aimed to examine relative validity and feasibility of a photo-based dietary record in everyday life. Design Parallel to the photo-based technique, a weighed record was performed. Participant satisfaction was assessed by questionnaire. A trained nutrition scientist evaluated portion sizes and nutrient content was calculated (DGExpert). Spearman correlation and Bland-Altman analyses were applied. Setting Healthy, non-pregnant volunteers (>= 18 years) without intent to lose weight recruited at Ulm University, Germany. Subjects Sixty-six participants (36 % males, median age 22 center dot 0 (interquartile range 20 center dot 0-25 center dot 0) years) took pictures of foods and beverages consumed with a commercially available mobile phone. Results Significant correlation between the photo-based and weighed record was observed: energy (r=0 center dot 991), carbohydrate (r=0 center dot 980), fat (r=0 center dot 972), protein (r=0 center dot 988), fibre (r=0 center dot 941). Bland-Altman analyses indicated comparable means and acceptable 95 % limits of agreement (energy: -345 center dot 2 to 302 center dot 9 kJ (-82 center dot 5 to 72 center dot 4 kcal); carbohydrate: -15 center dot 2 to 13 center dot 1 g; fat: -6 center dot 4 to 6 center dot 4 g; protein: -5 center dot 9 to 5 center dot 6 g; fibre: -2 center dot 7 to 2 center dot 5 g). However, with increasing intake level, underestimation by the digital method was present (except for fat, all P<0 center dot 01). Over 80 % of participants were satisfied with the photo-based record. In nearly 90 %, technical implementation was without major problems. Conclusions Compared with a weighed record, the photo-based dietary record seems to be valid, feasible and user-friendly to estimate energy, macronutrient and fibre intakes, although a systematic bias with increasing levels of intake should be kept in mind.

AB  - The present study compared the effectiveness of paper and digital flashcards. College students learned vocabulary from paper, computer, or tablet flashcards that were self-created or ready-made. Students then completed a memory recall test and answered questions on cognitive load, perceived control, satisfaction, and several individual difference variables. Results showed that students learned equally well from paper and tablet but less well from computer flashcards. They were less satisfied with, and felt less in control of, computer-based flashcards. Students also felt more satisfied with paper than either digital card set. Despite these differences, cognitive load was equivalent across platforms. In addition, students recalled more words and reported expelling more effort on ready-made over self-created flashcards. The individual difference variables did not relate to recall or satisfaction. Overall, students’ satisfaction, as well as perceived difficulty and level of control over the cards, meaningfully related to performance. This research suggests that paper and digital flashcards are equally viable options for students but platform matters. Mobile technologies like tablets might be especially advantageous. Furthermore, perceptions matter. Students may be inclined towards different cards based on their perceptions of difficulty level and the like, and thus flashcards should be available in a multitude of formats.

AB  - Explored whether free associations are psychometrically suitable for the assessment individual differences in attitudes. Study 1 measured attitudes toward East and West Germans with free associations. 52 participants including 29 East Germans and 23 West Germans (mean age 24 years) completed an attitude questionnaire and a continued free association task by phone. Study 2 examined the relationship of free associations with explicit and implicit attitudes. Data from 284 participants (mean age 28 years) including 100 East Germans and 184 West Germans was collected online. Results showed that whereas the specific content of the associations was rather unstable both within and across measurement points, independent judges rated their evaluative meaning as highly stable both in terms of internal consistency and stability over a 3-week interval. Findings also demonstrated good convergent validity between valence of associations estimates and attitude (Ossi-Wessi) implicit association test (IAT) and provided evidence that valence estimates of free associations are a composite of both implicit and explicit attitudes. Free associations are suggested as an alternative implicit measure to the explicit assessment of attitudes.

AB  - We aim to investigate the impact of marketing science articles and tools on the practice of marketing. This impact may be direct (e.g., an academic article may be adapted to solve a practical problem) or indirect (e.g., its contents may be incorporated into practitioners' tools,which then influence marketing decision making). We use the term 'marketing science value chain' to describe these diffusion steps, and survey marketing managers, marketing science intermediaries (practicing marketing analysts), and marketing academics to calibrate the value chain. In our sample, we find that (1) the impact of marketing science is perceived to be largest on decisions such as the management of brands, pricing, new products, product portfolios, and customer/market selection, and (2) tools such as segmentation, survey-based choice models, marketing mix models, and pre-test market models have the largest impact on marketing decisions. Exemplary papers from 1982 to 2003 that achieved dual—academic and practice—impact are Guadagni and Little (1983) and Green and Srinivasan (1990). Overall, our results are encouraging. First, we find that the impact of marketing science has been largest on marketing decision areas that are important to practice. Second, we find moderate alignment between academic impact and practice impact. Third, we identify antecedents of practice impact among dual impact marketing science papers. Fourth, we discover more recent trends and initiatives in the period 2004–2012, such as the increased importance of big data and the rise of digital and mobile communication, using the marketing science value chain as an organizing framework.

AB  - Screens, as technological but also narrative and social devices, alter reading and writing practices. Users consume vids, read stories on the Web, and produce creative contents on blogs or Web archives, etc. Uses of seriality and transmediality are here discussed, that is watching, reading, and writing as interpreting, as well as respective and reciprocal uses of iteration and interaction (with technologies and with others). A specific figure of users or readers will be defined as a skilful and literate audience: fans on archives (FanFiction.net-FFNet, and Archive of Our Own-AO3). Fans produce serial and transmedia narratives based upon their favourite TV Shows, publish on-line, and often produce discourses or meta-discourse on this writing practice or on writing in general. The broader perspective of reception studies allows us to develop a three-step methodology that develops into a process. The first step is an ethnographic approach based on practices and competencies of users. The second step develops and clarifies the ethnographic dimension into an ethno-narrative approach, which aims at analysing mutual links between signs, texts, and uses of reading and writing. The main question is that of significance and meaning. The third step elaborates upon interactions in a technological and mediated environment. Social, participative, or collaborative and multimodal dimensions of interacting are yet regarded as key elements in reshaping a reading-writing cultural practice. The model proposed is a socio-narrative device, which hangs upon three dimensions: techno-narrative, narratological, and socio-narrative. These three dimensions of a shared narrative universe illustrate the three steps process. Each step also offers specific uses of interacting: an ethnographic approach of fictional expectation, a narrative ethnography of iteration and transformation, and a socio-narrative perspective on dialogism and recognition. A specific but significant example of fans' uses of reading and interacting will illustrate each step of the methodology. This qualitative approach of individual uses aims to be representative of fans' cultural practice (See Appendix 1). We will discuss cultural uses of appropriation. How do reading, interpreting, writing, and rewriting, that is to say interacting, produce meaning, create identities, and build up our relation to others and to the (story)world? Given our interest in embodied and appropriated meanings, appropriation will be revealed as an open cultural process, which can question the conflict and/or the convergence of the old and the new in cultural practices, and the way former and formal dichotomies have to be re-evaluated. We will take an interest in the composition of meaning that unfolds a cultural and critical process, from acknowledgement to recognition, a process where iteration and transformation are no longer opposites but part of a continuum.

AB  - Billiards is a sport that not only requires numerous skills, but also emphasizes the strategies of planning the path of the contact and shot. Traditional billiards training mainly focuses on skills practicing, while the strategies for facing different kinds of challenges in billiards competitions are usually ignored. Therefore, referring to social constructivism, the current study proposed an ASQI (annotation, summarizing, questioning and interflow) mobile flipped learning approach to strengthen students’ pre-class learning effectiveness via engaging them in social interaction contexts to share experience and strategies of dealing with different billiards competition cases. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The participants were 80 university students from two classes; one class learned with the ASQI mobile flipped learning approach while the other adopted the traditional flipped learning approach. The results showed that ASQI could significantly enhance students’ billiards skills performance and online learning engagement with no influence on task load. In addition, according to the students’ feedback, ASQI could help students 'make effective use of strategies,' 'improve learning performance' and 'promote reflection.'

AB  - Abstract Grammatical information, embedded at the word level, makes the acquisition of morphologically rich languages quite complex as well as the language exercise generation process for teachers. This study introduces a new gamification approach for complex morphology learning and aims to analyze the students’ perceptions towards it. In this approach, the morphology components and their interactions are gradually introduced to the learners within a gamified environment through automatically generated exercises. Although not specific to any language, the approach has been applied to Turkish which is a strong representative of morphologically rich languages. The study was conducted for three weeks with international students in an introductory level Turkish language course via a mobile application developed using finite-state transducer technology to model morphology. Questionnaires, e-journals and semi-structured interviews were employed to examine the perceptions and experiences of the students in terms of perceived efficacy, system usage, engagement, loyalty, perceived enjoyment, attitude, and willingness to recommend. The findings of the study revealed that the students had positive perceptions towards the proposed approach and found it effective for their learning process. The approach is considered to fill an important gap in grammar exercises for learning morphologically rich languages.

AB  - [Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 59(11) of Ergonomics (see record [rid]2016-54264-001[/rid]). In the original article, the authors who contributed equally to the article were not listed correctly. The authors Guoxin Fan and Zhengqi Chen were listed as contributing equally. The corrected listing of the authors are present in the erratum.] This cross-sectional study aimed to identify gender differences in the cervical postures when young adults were using mobile phones, as well as the correlations between the postures and the digital devices use (computer and mobile phone). Questionnaires regarding the habits of computer and mobile phone use were administrated to 429 subjects aged from 17 to 33 years old (19.75 ± 2.58 years old). Subjects were instructed to stand habitually and use a mobile phone as in daily life; the sagittal head and cervical postures were measured by head flexion, neck flexion angle and gaze angle. Male participants had a significantly larger head flexion angle (96.41° ± 12.23° vs. 93.57° ± 12.62°, p = 0.018) and neck flexion angle (51.92° ± 9.55° vs. 47.09° ± 9.45°, p < 0.001) than females. There were significant differences in head (F = 3.62, p = 0.014) and neck flexion (F = 3.99, p = 0.009) between different amounts of computer use. Practitioner Summary: We investigated possible gender differences in head and neck postures of young adults using mobile phones, as well as the potential correlations between these postures and digital device use. We found that males displayed larger head and neck flexion angles than females, which were associated with the amount of computer use. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Nomophobia is considered as the 'disorder of modern world' and defined as 'fear of being without access to a mobile phone.' This study investigated gender differences in the relationship between problematic Internet use and nomophobia. Structural equation modeling (SEM) approach was employed to assess the relationship between nomophobia and four dimensions of the problematic Internet use, including diminished impulse control, loneliness/depression, social comfort, and distraction. The study used the Online Cognition Scale (OCS) and Nomophobia Questionnaire (NMP-Q) to collect data from 490 undergraduate students. Results indicated that loneliness/depression, distraction, and diminished impulse control were significantly related to nomophobia. However, there was not a significant relationship between social comfort and nomophobia. Further, multi group analysis results suggested notable gender differences in the relationship between problematic Internet use and nomophobia. The results for women indicated that loneliness/depression, diminished-impulse control, and distraction have a positive and significant relationship with nomophobia. Whereas only loneliness/depression and distraction were found to be significantly related to nomophobia among men. The results indicated a statistically significant difference in nomophobia and problematic Internet use between women and men subjects, where women subjects scored higher than the men.

AB  - Self‐involving responses are direct expressions of genetic counselors’ here‐and‐now feelings about/reactions to patients. Strategic, sparing use of self‐involving responses may enhance practitioner genuineness, likeability, and trustworthiness, decrease patient anxiety, and increase patient trust and engagement. Conversely, they may threaten patients who are uncomfortable with emotional expression or confuse them about the counselor's intentions. Despite theorized benefits and risks, no study has explored genetic counselor self‐involving responses. This study explored whether clinical genetic counselors use self‐involving responses with their patients, reasons for doing so, and their perceptions of when and why the responses work well versus poorly. Two‐hundred sixty‐eight genetic counselors, invited via a National Society of Genetic Counselors e‐blast, completed an online screening survey. Eighty‐nine percent reported using self‐involving responses with patients, and 17 were purposively selected to participate in semi‐structured phone interviews. Thematic analysis yielded themes regarding potential benefits, risks, counselor factors and context, and patient factors related to using self‐involving responses. Benefits include conveying counselor conditions for facilitating counseling process (e.g., genuineness, building rapport, focusing the session, and encouraging the patient to open‐up), and counseling outcomes by validating decision‐making. Risks of use include hindering counseling processes and outcomes by misperceiving patient feelings, boundary crossing, and being unduly directive. Factors, both from the counselor and the context of the session, include comfort with the technique, mastery of clinical skills, minimal knowledge of patient emotions, type of counseling session, and counselor practice specialty. Patient factors include prior rapport with the counselor, and patient emotionality and cultural background. Findings underscore the need for training about this technique. Future research could examine patients’ perceptions of self‐involving statements and differences in self‐involvement across practice specialties and counseling modalities.

AB  - There are currently three generations of individuals that make up the genetic counselor workforce: Baby‐Boomers, Generation X, and Millennials. These generations are presumed to be shaped by the historical, cultural, and social events that occurred during critical developmental periods. Understanding the underlying perceptions and viewpoints of genetic counselors regarding the multigenerational workforce may facilitate successful working relationships as well as recognition of the perceived unique characteristics that each generation offers. An online survey was distributed to practicing genetics counselors (GC) and genetic counseling students through the National Society of Genetic Counselors and the American Board of Genetic Counseling to elicit opinions about the perceived characteristics or skills of genetic counselors in each generation. Respondents (n = 407, estimated 10% response) preferentially assigned certain traits or skills to specific generations including their own. Findings suggest GC Baby Boomers were least likely to be described as 'comfortable with phone or skype counseling' (p < 0.0001), Millennial GC, were least often assigned the term 'Strong respect for authority' (p < 0.0005) and Generation X GC were most likely to be described as 'Does not ask for feedback' (p < 0.05). These research findings demonstrate that GC perceive that their colleagues from every generation have unique attributes to bring to the profession and these attributes match those typically described in the U.S. literature about non‐GC cohorts.

AB  - The study of mundane, everyday uses of the Internet remains an emerging field of inquiry. Analysing data from a large seven country survey of Internet use and adapting concepts and methods developed by Bourdieu, we show that there are distinct clusters of users who use the Internet in diverse ways to solve everyday problems, such as buying a mobile phone or diagnosing an illness. Such everyday problem-solving is dependent upon degrees of economic, social, digital and cultural capital, and varies across countries. A comparative methodological strategy combined the use of multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), and for the first time in the field, multiple factor analysis for contingency tables (MFACTs). Extending the work of Bourdieu and the sociology of class more generally, we argue that digital capital functions as a bridging capital aiding the convertibility of other forms of capital to the benefit of already advantaged groups.

AB  - Connectivity among societies has increased manifold in a globalized world. Media, mainly digital media, have emerged as an exciting player in the globalization process. It simultaneously augments the globalization process and also fuels ultra-localism- a complex socio-cultural phenomenon. In India, growing smartphone users have been changing the pattern of media content consumption. In the last three years, with the availability of cheap internet data, the Indian audience is consuming more and more online media content. In the entertainment sector, media consumers are showing a significant change in their consumption behaviour. Traditional cinema viewing is gradually being replaced by watching cinema and shows on Over The Top (OTT) media platforms like Amazon Prime, Netflix and other service providers. This paper probes how Indian millennial audiences, mainly the 'Digital Mainstream' has been watching cinema on OTT platforms and why are they switching to mobile devices rather than sticking to the big cinema screens. Are they satisfied with watching the content on a smaller screen or are there still craving for watching on a bigger screen? Is the content different? Is the experience different?. Applying the method of survey and in-depth interviews, this exploratory paper attempts to find an answer to these research questions. Since the entertainment media content creators including the director and producers of cinema are adapting themselves to the behaviour of the audience of the OTT platforms, this paper may throw more light on the behavioural pattern of the young audience so far as taking to the new medium is concerned.

AB  - This chapter provides a number of different strategies that faculty might use to leverage mobile devices within their courses. It explores the question of why we might consider taking a 'mobile-first' mentality when designing courses. A strategy that can be rather easily incorporated into the face-to-face classroom is the use the mobile devices as a way of delivering an advanced organizer. Many faculty utilize their campus learning management system (LMS) for face-to-face or online courses and most LMS have a mobile version. Arguably, one of the most important elements of any course is effective and efficient interaction between the instructor and student both in and out of the classroom. Another consideration of mobile-first design in the classroom is using alternative communication platforms to interact and communicate electronically with students. A fully mobile course would likely contain materials that are inherently interactive and adaptive to individual learners and where classroom activities can be easily completed on one's smartphone.

AB  - This study examines the effects of online gossip propensity in social networking sites (SNSs). We posit that online gossip propensity affects SNS identification, which in turn determines normative pressure and SNS engagement. The ultimate outcome is electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) intention. We also explore the impact of two types of SNS communication channel, i.e. handheld (mobile devices and tablets) and traditional (desktop PCs and laptops) computing devices. The data were collected from a questionnaire survey with 400 general consumers. Using a scenario approach, we asked the respondents how they would react to a special discount campaign for a popular beer brand ad posted on an SNS. Our structural equation modelling results indicate that online gossip propensity is indeed a significant driver of SNS identification. All hypothesised paths are supported, except the one from normative pressure to eWOM intention. Furthermore, SNS communication channels had a clear impact, since the latent means are greater for most of the constructs in the handheld computing device group than in the traditional computing device group.

AB  - While grids or matrix questions are a widely used format in PC web surveys, there is no agreement on the format in mobile web surveys. We conducted a two-wave experiment in an opt in panel in Russia, varying the question format (grid format and item-by-item format) and device respondents used for survey completion (smartphone and PC). The 1,678 respondents completed the survey in the assigned conditions in the first wave and 1,079 in the second wave. Overall, we found somewhat higher measurement error in the grid format in both mobile and PC web conditions. We found almost no significant effect of the question format on test–retest correlations between the latent scores in two waves and no differences in breakoff rates between the question formats. The multigroup comparison showed some measurement equivalence between the question formats. However, the difference varied depending on the length of a scale with a longer scale producing some differences in the measurement equivalence between the conditions. The levels of straightlining were higher in the grid than in the item-by-item format. In addition, concurrent validity was lower in the grid format in both PC and mobile web conditions. Finally, subjective indicators of respondent burden showed that the grid format increased reported technical difficulties and decreased subjective evaluation of the survey.

AB  - There is some evidence that a scrolling design may reduce breakoffs in mobile web surveys compared to a paging design, but there is little empirical evidence to guide the choice of the optimal number of items per page. We investigate the effect of the number of items presented on a page on data quality in two types of questionnaires: with or without user-controlled skips. Three versions of a 30-item instrument were compared, with 5, 15, or all 30 questions presented on a page, in two different surveys, one with skips and one without. We found that displaying 30 items on a page reduced the breakoff rate by almost one-third compared to presenting five items per page in the questionnaire without skips, but the difference was not statistically significant. In both surveys with and without skips, the completion times were significantly lower in the 30-item per page condition; however, item nonresponse rates were also higher. We give some practical recommendations to guide choices while designing questionnaires for mobile web surveys. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - WeChat is not only a mobile application with many innovative features but is also representative of China’s electronic revolution. It is compatible with more than 90% of smart phones and has become an indispensable tool for daily use. People are captivated by various types of WeChat voting and canvassing activities, but little research has investigated whether such voting is based on guanxi or justice. Are people truly willing to vote on WeChat? Is WeChat voting an effective means of acquaintance marketing? In this research, three studies were conducted. First, 656 respondents were surveyed, and the results showed that more than 90% of WeChat users have participated in WeChat voting and that their voting behaviour is based on guanxi (human relations). Second, an online questionnaire was administered to 731 subjects, and the results were statistically analysed to determine whether voting behaviour is motivated by guanxi (mien-tzu, reciprocity or intimacy) or by justice (belief in a just world). The results showed that people’s behaviour deviates from their intention. Third, 676 subjects were investigated, and logistic regression was used to model and analyse the characteristics of voting participants. The many interesting findings reveal that men show more ‘empathy’ than women and that men are more likely to vote on WeChat based on reciprocity and intimacy. In addition, older people emphasize emotion, whereas students are more interested in fostering connections for the future. Inappropriate WeChat voting behaviour does not facilitate promotional marketing, damages the reputation of the company and reduces customer loyalty. These findings provide theoretical, methodological, and practical contributions to strategies for effective acquaintance marketing. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore the effects of different acupuncture insertion velocities. Design: This study was performed as a within-subject design to control for individual differences. The biomechanical properties of needle insertion and accompanying subjective acupuncture perception was compared between different insertion velocities. Setting: The setting for this study was the laboratory of acupuncture meridian and functional neurology, Acupuncture and Meridian Science Research Center, Kyung Hee University. Subjects: Sixteen (16) healthy volunteers participated in the study. Intervention: An acupuncture needle was inserted to the acupoint LI4 by an acupuncture needle insertion device (ANI-KY) at high or low speed of needle insertion. Outcome measures: Biomechanical properties such as force and depth were measured online by sensors equipped with the ANI-KY device. Participants filled out a questionnaire about acupuncture sensation or perception. Results: Acupuncture needle insertion at a higher velocity was linked with higher maximum power, lower level of pain, and de qi–like perceptions such as 'compressing' and 'heavy' ( p < 0.05). Conclusions: These results suggest that needle insertion velocity might be a factor for controlling inadvertent pain during the acupuncture needling process and that biomechanical properties of needling may be related to acupuncture perception or sensation.

AB  - Objectives: Teachers often wonder what students are doing during lectures, behind their computers, mobile phones and other digital tools. This study aimed to document the type of tools used during lectures by nursing students and what they do with them. Methods: We carried out a descriptive, prospective, multicentre study including 1446 nursing students in Alsace (France). The students filled in an anonymous questionnaire at the end of a lesson they had just attended. Results: 99% of the students had taken at least one digital tool to the lesson. 90% had a mobile phone with them. It was mainly used for entertainment (particularly for sending and/or receiving text messages and consulting emails). 52% had a laptop with them. It was essentially used for academic tasks (taking notes, working on other teaching units or revising for exams). Conclusion: Most nursing students take a phone or laptop to lectures with them with the intention of using them for entertainment and learning respectively. These results could guide training establishments in drafting their institutional policy concerning the use of digital tools in class. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Parents are the main mediators of the digital exposure and experiences of young children. When adopting a parental mediation style, they are challenged by a dilemma: protecting their children often means invading their privacy and restricting their options. The adopted parental mediation style is pondered according to the perceptions and experiences of parents regarding digital media; it is an ongoing and dynamic negotiation between the actions of parents and children. Our research focuses on mobile apps, since the favourite devices of young children are smartphones and tablets, in order to explore how parents and children select apps, and which criteria they use. Our fieldwork was conducted in Portugal and used a mixed method, combining an online survey to a purposive sample of 1955 parents of children under 8 years old, and separate interviews to parents and children under 8 to a purposive sample of 81 families. Our results reveal how parents are coping with contrasting perceptions on digital media and how they negotiate their parental mediation style in interaction with their children. Parents believe more in building trust than in restricting children, but when they find it necessary, their will to protect overcomes their respect for the children's privacy. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Highlights • We study the role of messaging apps in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. • Messaging app use for news is negatively related to factual political knowledge. • Messaging app use for news is positively related to miscalibration of knowledge. • Messaging app use for news is positively related to political participation. • Miscalibration of knowledge is positively related to political participation. Abstract Mobile messaging apps, such as Snapchat, Facebook Messenger, and WhatsApp, were unique campaign and information platforms in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. This study assesses how using such apps for campaign information is related to political knowledge and participation. Data from an online survey conducted prior to the election indicate that using messaging apps for news is positively related to knowledge miscalibration. Knowledge miscalibration is positively related to offline and online political participation. Findings are discussed in terms of the role of messaging apps in the political process.

AB  - This study unveils the cognitive mechanism that locus of control (LOC) dimensions (internal control, chance control, and control by powerful others) predict intention to reuse mobile apps for making hotel reservations. The predictions are assumed through the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) anchors and perceived risk. Drawn from an online survey with 457 Chinese participants, results show direct positive predictions of intention to reuse from UTAUT anchors including performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions. Perceived risk also negatively predicts intention. Effort expectancy mediates the links between internal/chance control and intention, whereas perceived risk mediates only the latter link. Facilitating conditions mediate the relationship between control by powerful others and intention. This study contributes to existing research by distinguishing the mechanisms that underpin LOC dimensions and technology re-adoption. Practitioners are recommended to improve booking apps by addressing the concerns of users with different LOC. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This chapter analyses data from an experiment implemented in 2015 in Spain using the Netquest online panel. The authors administered the same questionnaire to the same respondents in two consecutive waves of data collection, separated by a one-week break. In this work they used a subset of the complete dataset, focusing on 719 respondents who participated in the survey both times using a mobile device. The main objective was to study if the screen size affects four different indicators: completion time, failure to answer an Instructional Manipulation Check question, answer consistency, and evaluation of the survey experience. The chapter evaluates if and how the screen size of mobile devices can affect data quality on web surveys, measured by four indicators. It uses data from a two-wave crossover experiment implemented in 2015 within the opt-in online panel Netquest, in Spain. Following a review of relevant literature, the chapter introduces the hypotheses, and then presents details of the data collection methodology and analytic approach. The chapter concludes by presenting the particular findings and outlining broader implications for surveys using mobile devices. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Given the importance of survey measures of online media use for communication research, it is crucial to assess and improve their quality, in particular because the increasingly fragmented and ubiquitous usage of internet complicates the accuracy of self-reported measures. This study contributes to the discussion regarding the accuracy of self-reported internet use by presenting relevant factors potentially affecting biases of self-reports and testing survey design strategies to improve accuracy. Combining automatic tracking data and survey data from the same participants (N = 690) confirmed low levels of accuracy and tendencies of over-reporting. The analysis revealed biases due to a range of factors associated with the intensity of (actual) internet usage, propensity to multitask, day of reference, and the usage of mobile devices. An anchoring technique could not be proved to reduce inaccuracies of reporting behavior. Several recommendations for research practice follow from these findings. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The objectives of this research were to: (1) identify Mobile Computer Terminal (MCT) human factors issues, (2) formulate guidelines and an enhanced MCT for improving interface design and implementation in police patrols, and (3) identify areas of future research to fill gaps in the literature. A systematic literature search was conducted leading to results categorized in four groups including: productivity, physical discomfort, interface usability, and driving distraction. Although MCT use has increased officer productivity, several usability issues need to be resolved. The MCT has also increased officer physical discomfort and distraction. MCT design and implementation guidelines that resolve human factors issues in police patrols were identified along with an enhanced design concept. Guidelines for MCT design were validated with an online survey completed by 81 police officers. Future research directions were proposed to recognize police officer needs and work context.

AB  - [Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 18(6) of Theoretical Issues in Ergonomics Science (see record [rid]2017-38225-001[/rid]). When the original article was first published online, there was error in the order of the given name and the family name of the author. This has now has been corrected to 'Jordan Navarro'.] A technological race toward always ever-increasing automation is engaged, a race in which automation users are hardly considered.

AB  - Reports an error in 'Human–machine interaction theories and lane departure warnings' by Jordan Navarro (Theoretical Issues in Ergonomics Science, 2017[Nov], Vol 18[6], 519-547).

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2017-38225-004[/rid]). A technological race toward always ever-increasing automation is engaged, a race in which automation users are hardly considered. This explains why more automation is not necessarily for the best.

AB  - This article explores how mobile phones function as an affective technology for young adults, by adapting the self-expansion model to understand attachment to mobile phones. In an online survey, 272 smart phone users reported on their recalled responses to loss/separation from their mobile phone (not by choice), as well as their use of the mobile phone for self-expansion. Results show that self-expansion via mobile phone was associated with greater inclusion of the mobile phone in the self-concept and greater subjective well-being. Most respondents reported negative feelings, such as loneliness/disconnection, anxiety, and boredom, when without their mobile phone, but others felt relieved to be out of touch with others. The use of the mobile phone for self-expansion was associated with more negative emotion and less positive emotion (relief) in response to loss/separation from the phone. Interpretations of the findings are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Using a comprehensive personality model, this study is the first to examine the relationship between a full range of personality traits and cell phone addiction. 346 college students completed an online survey that asked respondents to complete measures of the Big-Five personality traits and measures of materialism and need for arousal, Barratt’s (1959) impulsiveness scale, and a four-item measure of cell phone addiction. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Couched in Mowen’s (2000) 3M Hierarchical Model of Personality, the elemental traits of emotional instability and materialism were positively associated while introversion was negatively associated with cell phone addiction. The central trait of attention impulsiveness exhibited a direct and positive association with cell phone addiction. A significant negative relationship between conscientiousness and all three dimensions of Barratt’s impulsiveness scale (central trait) was found. Several additional relationships between the elemental traits of Mowen’s personality hierarchy and the three dimensions of impulsiveness (central trait) also were uncovered. Study implications and future research directions are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Mobile phone use while driving is a well-recognized area of concern. However, while texting/calling among young adult drivers has received much research attention, more research is needed regarding other phone functions used by young adults while driving. Study aim: To explore mobile phone functions used by young adult drivers while driving. Results: An online survey of 17–24 year old drivers (N = 612; 428 females) and focus groups with drivers aged (N = 18; 8 females) revealed that mobile phone use while driving was a very common behavior, with more full licence drivers compared with Learner/Provisional drivers using their phone to make/answer calls, send/read text messages and for internet browsing. This nature of mobile phone use while driving was varied, with phones commonly used for entertainment (e.g., to play music), to connect with others (via texting and/or voice calls) and for navigation. Concluding remarks: Young adults use a variety of functions on their phone while driving. It is important that young driver-targeted intervention efforts acknowledge that multiple functions of the mobile phone are used during the drive and it serves multiple purposes. Examining the inhibitors and facilitators of mobile phone use and its various functions while driving is needed, in addition to elucidating if the usage of particular mobile phone functions is similar across different driver cohorts.

AB  - Untersucht wurden unterschiedliche Beendigungsverläufe über 29 Tage nach einem unbegleiteten Raucherentwöhnungsversuch durch eine ökologische Kurzzeitbewertung (EMA). Um diese Trajektorien zu validieren, wurde die Vorhersage der Rauchhäufigkeit bis zu sechs Monate später getestet. Die UKORE über Mobiltelefone wurde verwendet, um Echtzeitdaten über das Rauchen (ja/nein) nach einem unbegleiteten Aufhörversuch über 29 Tage zu sammeln. Die Häufigkeit des Rauchens ein, drei und sechs Monate nach dem Abbruchversuch wurde mit Online-Fragebögen bewertet. Die Wachstumsmodellierung der latenten Klasse wurde verwendet, um die Daten von 230 Selbstzahlern im Alter zwischen 20 und 40 Jahren (Durchschnittsalter 28 Jahre) zu analysieren. Die Ergebnisse zeigen vier verschiedene Abbruchtrajektorien: Abbrecher (43,9%), Spätabsender (11,3%), Rückkehrer (17%) und Dauerraucher (27,8%). Die Beendigungsverläufe sagten die Rauchfrequenz ein, drei und sechs Monate nach dem Beendigungsversuch voraus. Es wird der Schluss gezogen, dass das Ergebnis nach einem Raucherentwöhnungsversuch besser durch vier verschiedene Trajektorien beschrieben wird als durch eine binäre Variable für Abstinenz oder Rückfall.

AB  - Investigated distinct quitting trajectories over 29 days after an unassisted smoking cessation attempt by ecological momentary assessment (EMA). In order to validate these trajectories, prediction of smoking frequency up to six months later was tested. EMA via mobile phones was used to collect real time data on smoking (yes/no) after an unassisted quit attempt over 29 days. Smoking frequency one, three and six months after the quit attempt was assessed with online questionnaires. Latent class growth modeling was used to analyze the data of 230 self-quitters aged between 20 and 40 years (mean age 28 years). Results show four different quitting trajectories: quitter (43.9%), late quitter (11.3%), returner (17%), and persistent smoker (27.8%). The quitting trajectories predicted smoking frequency one, three, and six months after the quit attempt. It is concluded that outcome after a smoking cessation attempt is better described by four distinct trajectories instead of a binary variable for abstinence or relapse.

AB  - Reality TV has inspired ongoing scholarly analysis of how formerly passive audience members are turned into active participants or even empowered citizens, but the actual encounters between media producers and media participants have been little explored. This article presents a detailed, critical study of the new interfaces to public visibility, combining an historical perspective with the in-depth study of production practices. Beginning with the several participatory forms of reality TV already established in the earliest days of broadcasting, I trace how audience members have long been recruited according to either a celebrity model or a citizen model of participation. I then demonstrate how these models are combined in the production of American Idol to support both its preparation and its presentation of participants, and how new media (online and mobile) are mobilized to both reinforce and capitalize upon this participation. Questioning the popular and scholarly hype surrounding the audience's "power" in reality TV, I conclude that the television industry is actually strengthening its grip on people in order to reduce costs and risks while increasing revenues in a time of uncertain financial prospects.

AB  - A mixed methods research project combining quantitative online survey results with semistructured interview data explored how a major metropolitan newspaper's digital subscribers engage with mobile news. Themes of continuity indicate that motivations in traditional newspaper use remain salient in mobile news: informationseeking, the pleasure of reading and powerful daily habits surrounding news use. In addition, participants' responses suggest additional situational or process gratifications from using mobile media devices, in addition to gratifications derived from content.

AB  - This editorial presents rapid advances in imaging technologies which is greatly understate the sheer impact that digital images of all kinds have had in shaping our lives. Digital film and photography, the internet, smartphones, interactive films and installations, digital archives, 3D imaging technologies, CCTV and virtual environments are now part of the quotidian life of many of us living in those parts of the world touched upon by such media. The emergence of cheap and portable digital imaging technologies such as cameras and mobile phones, widespread availability of internet access and broadband connectivity, and the development of easy-to-use online software applications and web-based storage sites have all influenced the uptake of imaging technologies for such activities. Some contributors to this issue share this concern to focus attention on the participatory culture of digital image production. Belonging to networks rather than places and questioning many of the fundamental distinctions through which author conventionally approach images at large, digital images are no longer unilinear products confined to the order of the visible.

AB  - This exploratory research considers the implications to actual world (AW) nations and attachments of an online virtual world (OVW) which mimics so many aspects of AW nation-states. Using Lessing's interrogation of mimesis as a framing device, this paper presents the results of a quantitative investigation that examines the relationship between the competing loyalties of AW nations and the OVW of Second Life (SL). To that end, a subsample of 212 members of SL completed an online survey which measured five aspects of the national and SL attachment, including a section in which participants ranked their concern for fellow co-nationals (CNs) versus their concern for fellow Second Lifers (SLers). Analyses of the data produced four main findings. First, 45 per cent of participants ranked their concern for their fellow SLers above that of their fellow CNs. Second, those who preferred SLers were significantly less attached to their AW nations than those who preferred CNs. Third, the SLer-preferred, on average, considered SL to be like a world, while the CN-preferred were more ambivalent in this regard. Fourth, gender differences indicate that males who preferred SLers spent most of their time in the SL engaged in activities while females who preferred SLers spent most of their time in the SL engaged in communicatory socializing. Discussion of these results focuses on notions of cosmopolitanism versus nation-statehood and uses the category of gender to illustrate the implications of mimesis to the durability of the phenomenon of nation-statehood.

AB  - Blended therapy is a new approach combining advantages of face-to-face psychotherapy and Internet- and mobile-based interventions. Acceptance is a fundamental precondition for its implementation. The aim of this study was to assess 1) the acceptance of psychotherapists towards blended therapy, 2) the effectiveness of an acceptance facilitating intervention (AFI) on psychotherapists’ acceptance towards blended therapy and 3) to identify potential effect moderators. Psychotherapists (N = 284) were randomly assigned to a control (CG) or an intervention group (IG). The IG received a short video showing an example of blended therapy, the CG an attention placebo video. Both groups received a reliable online questionnaire assessing acceptance, effort expectancy, performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, social influence and internet anxiety. Between group differences were examined using t-tests and Mann-Whitney tests. Exploratory analysis was conducted to identify moderators. Psychotherapists in CG showed mixed baseline acceptance towards blended therapy (low = 40%, moderate = 33%, high = 27%). IG showed significantly higher acceptance compared to CG (d = .27, pone-sided = .029; low = 24%, moderate = 47%, high = 30%). Bootstrapped confidence intervals were overlapping. Performance expectancy (d = .35), effort expectancy (d = .44) and facilitating conditions (d = .28) were significantly increased (p < .05). No effects on social influence and internet anxiety were found (p > .05). Exploratory analysis indicated psychodynamic oriented psychotherapists profiting particularly from the AFI. Blended therapy is a promising approach to improve healthcare. Psychotherapists show mixed acceptance, which might be improvable by AFIs, particularly in subpopulations of initially rather skeptical psychotherapists. Forthcoming studies should extend the present study by shifting focus from attitudes to the impact of different forms of AFIs on uptake. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - With the emergence of innovative mobile-based tools, new opportunities have been made to enhance the quality of language learning. Keeping this in mind, the current study aimed to investigate the impact of a flipped classroom on enhancing EFL learners’ pragmatic competence. To this end, 60 EFL learners from two universities in Iran were assigned into flipped and conventional groups. In the flipped group, the course materials were posted through Telegram app before the class, and the class time was mostly devoted to communicative activities. To elicit the required data, multiple sources of data collection, including a Discourse Completion Test (DCT), a study log, the teacher's field notes, a Learning Experience Questionnaire (LEQ), a written self-report survey, and a Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) questionnaire, were used. Both parametric and non-parametric statistics were used to analyze the data. The findings revealed that the participants of the flipped group were more engaged with the course contents and significantly outperformed their counterparts in the conventional group in the post-test. The results of the questionnaires suggested that most participants of the flipped group enjoyed learning English in a flipped learning environment, and willingly accepted Telegram as a suitable platform in learning language. The authors present insights into the impact of flipped classrooms on appropriate use of English refusals, the participants' perception of the flipped learning experience, their level of participation inside and outside the class, their impression of the online platform, Telegram, and offer implications for practice.

AB  - University academic faculty in Pakistan are facing greater pressures and higher workload from their jobs. It was hypothesized that faculty face quantitative, cognitive, and emotional demands on their jobs which would positively impact their experience of conflict arising from work and affecting family roles. A sample of 425 public sector faculty member from Pakistan filled an online survey questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of demographic information, Work to Family Conflict Scale-Short Form (Kacmar, Wayne, Carlson, Ferguson, & Whitten, 2014), and Job Demands Scale consisting of four items adopted by Experience and Evaluation of Work (Van Veldhoven & Meijman, 1994). Findings of t-test revealed that female faculty perceived significantly higher work-to-family conflict and cognitive demands compared to male faculty, while there was no gender difference in perceptions of quantitative and emotional demands. The hypothesized model was tested using structural equation modeling and a good fit was achieved. The direct relationship between quantitative and emotional job demands with work to the family conflict was significant and between cognitive job demands and work to family conflict was insignificant. No gender-based variance was found in the hypothesized model. The results can provide guidelines for the university administration to device effective work-family policies.

AB  - The aim of the study is to document how academics who mother have reorganized work and childcare since the beginning of the coronavirus (COVID‐19) pandemic in the United States, how those shifts have affected their academic productivity, and solutions proposed by academics living these experiences. We collected data via an online survey and, subsequently, by conducting qualitative interviews with a subsample of participants. From June to August 2020, 131 female‐identified academics who mother were recruited via a Facebook group, Academic Mamas, and participated in our online survey. Twenty participants were then interviewed via phone or Zoom to explore more deeply the experiences of academics who mother. Results of our research suggest that since the start of the COVID‐19 pandemic, the pressure on academics who mother is immense. Analysis of the qualitative data revealed three major themes: (1) inability to meet institutional expectations; (2) juggling work and family life; and (3) proposed solutions. Our results suggest that significant efforts must be made by academic institutions to acknowledge and value the childcare responsibilities of academics who mother and to create solutions that fully address the challenges they face in meeting the academic expectations and requirements that largely remain unmodified despite the pandemic.

AB  - A digital initiative by the Government of India where the fertilizers distributed manually are now being sold through Electronic Point of Sale system with integration of digital records of beneficiaries. The Aadhaar enabled Fertilizer Distribution System (AeFDS) is a potential to streamline subsidies to actual beneficiaries and also facilitate in releasing subsidies to fertilizer companies based on the actual sales made. The ePoS device retrieves information from UIDAI server, Webland server & SHC server for authentication and transactions are made through the Biometrically Authenticated Physical uptake (BAPU) model. The Dept. of Fertilizers under the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers, Govt. of India has chosen the Krishna district's (Andhra Pradesh state) model of implementation for piloting DBT in fertilizers in 16 districts across the country. The paper focuses on the detailed study of the implementation of the pilot project in the district of Rangareddy, Telangana state. The paper examines the dealers adaptability to the new technology, and farmers awareness levels of the system in the district. And also to identify the advantages and disadvantages of the project in the district from the view point of dealers and farmers in the Rangareddy district of Telangana. The paper uses focus group discussions with farmers, information from the dealers gathered through questionnaire to examine the adoptability of the system and also the District administration action plan in encountering the field problems. The level of adoption by the dealers to the technology analyzed with the help of adoption theory. The study has thrown light on the adoption process to new technology at field level and also helps to understand the farmer acceptance levels to the new system and District machinery background work.

AB  - Objective: Increased rates of suicidal ideation/behavior have been reported in individuals with human immunodeficiency virus infection/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The electronic Columbia-Suicidality Severity Rating Scale (eCSSRS™) is a validated tool for assessment of suicidal risk. The objective of this study was to assess the site perspectives on implementation of the eC-SSRS used in Phase IIIb studies of dolutegravir. Methods: We developed and validated the ViiV eC-SSRS Metrics and Perspectives Site Questionnaire (VEQ). Topics included ease of eC-SSRS administration, agreement with clinical assessment, unreported risk, and confidence in utility of the eC-SSRS. Results: Clinical data from two Phase IIIb studies were reviewed for correlation with the eC-SSRS results. The overall VEQ response rate was 83%. A total of 85% of respondents administered the eC-SSRS by phone, and 34% reported their patients would be unable to complete a web survey. First-time eC-SSRS users made up 64% of the responders; 85% of repeat administrators said implementation became easier over time. One-half said the eC-SSRS accurately predicted risk, and 14% said the eC-SSRS identified previously unreported risk. A total of 65% were somewhat/very confident their patients are being assessed accurately for suicide risk. Conclusion: Results of the eC-SSRS from ARIA and STRIIVING were consistent with the clinical data. The eC-SSRS identified previous unreported risk for suicidality and provided physicians opportunity for follow-up. Respondents felt the eC-SSRS helps them manage suicide risk, and they reported that its administration became easier with experience. Thus, the eC-SSRS is considered a useful tool in this setting.

AB  - A recent hypothesis in empirical brain research on language is that the fundamental difference between animal and human communication systems is captured by the distinction between finite‐state and more complex phrase‐structure grammars, such as context‐free and context‐sensitive grammars. However, the relevance of this distinction for the study of language as a neurobiological system has been questioned and it has been suggested that a more relevant and partly analogous distinction is that between non‐adjacent and adjacent dependencies. Online memory resources are central to the processing of non‐adjacent dependencies as information has to be maintained across intervening material. One proposal is that an external memory device in the form of a limited push‐down stack is used to process non‐adjacent dependencies. We tested this hypothesis in an artificial grammar learning paradigm where subjects acquired non‐adjacent dependencies implicitly. Generally, we found no qualitative differences between the acquisition of non‐adjacent dependencies and adjacent dependencies. This suggests that although the acquisition of non‐adjacent dependencies requires more exposure to the acquisition material, it utilizes the same mechanisms used for acquiring adjacent dependencies. We challenge the push‐down stack model further by testing its processing predictions for nested and crossed multiple non‐adjacent dependencies. The push‐down stack model is partly supported by the results, and we suggest that stack‐like properties are some among many natural properties characterizing the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms that implement the online memory resources used in language and structured sequence processing.

AB  - Aim: To investigate general practitioners’ (GPs’) desire and perceived added value of point-of-care (POC) troponin, its effect on referral decisions, and test requirements. Background: Excluding acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in primary care remains a diagnostic challenges for GPs. Consequently, referral rates of chest pain patients are high, while the incidence of a cardiovascular problem is only 8–15%. Previous studies have shown that GPs are interested in a POC troponin test. This test could enhance rapid exclusion of ACS, thereby preventing unnecessary patient distress, without compromising safety and while reducing costs. However, using this test is not recommended in current guidelines due to uncertainty in the test’s potential added value, and the lower sensitivity early after symptom onset as compared with troponin tests in a regular laboratory. Methods: An online survey containing 34 questions was distributed among 837 Dutch GPs in June 2015. Findings: A total of 126 GPs (15.1%) completed at least 75% of the questions. 67.1% of GPs believe that POC troponin tests have moderate to very high added value. Although the availability of a POC test is expected to increase the frequency at which troponin tests are used, it likely decreases (immediate) referral rates. Of the responding GPs, 78.3% only accept 10 min as the maximum test duration, 78.1% think reimbursement of the POC device is required for implementation, and 68.9% consider it necessary that it can be performed with a finger prick blood sample. In conclusion, according toGPs, the POC troponin test can be of added value to exclude ACS early on. Actual test implementation will depend on test characteristics, including test duration, type of blood sample required, and reimbursement of the analyzer.

AB  - Surveys are conducted all over the world. They represent influential sources of information for public opinion formation and decision-making. Their quality should therefore be sufficient for this important function. We assume that surveys can fulfill this function only if appropriately designed and prepared to militate efficiently against the known sources of survey error. Just what do these demands mean in a changing world? In responding to socio-technological change, survey research is changing itself. While new ways of conducting surveys emerge and replace others, they change the way in which people respond to survey requests and the way in which they answer survey questions. A case in point is the growing importance of web surveys, access panels, and the use of mobile communication devices like mobile phones, smartphones, and tablet PCs. Special challenges arise from the mixture of survey modes, contact modes, question and response formats. We know that people respond differently to different implementations of survey research. Response rates, for instance, vary considerably between survey modes like face-to-face, telephone, and web. The same applies to the response behavior itself. Answers to sensitive questions are likely to be more honest if obtained in self-administered modes. Just how valid are answers if obtained in response to special techniques for asking sensitive questions? We know that individual response propensities may be affected by design features such as mixtures of contact modes, the use of prepaid incentives, and refusal conversion efforts. But what about the effects of such interventions on sample composition and the answering behavior of respondents? If the mixing of modes is an appropriate answer to declining response propensities and changing communication habits, what are its consequences? Do such interventions impair the comparability of survey responses and, if yes, is it possible to enhance comparability post hoc? This all calls for continued research focus on the improvement of survey methods. To this end, the current volume presents recent methodological and statistical research from different European countries. It attends to major sources of survey error, established and emerging forms of conducting survey research, and recent approaches to meeting the challenges that they present. In this chapter, we shortly introduce these major sources of survey error, starting with the types of error encountered in the first stages of a survey, and going through the whole survey process. All chapters of this book relate to one or more of these survey design issues and the associated survey error, as we will show. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Mobile phone use while driving (MWD) is a threat to road safety, particularly for younger drivers. Research suggests impulsivity may be a psychological risk factor for MWD, however, the literature is limited. The current study examined the unique contributions of impulsivity facets on different social interactive MWD behaviours, and whether these relationships were influenced by mobile phone involvement. Eight hundred and fifty-three young drivers aged 17–25 years (Mage = 19.89; 74 % female) completed an online questionnaire which included measures of the five-facet model of impulsivity, mobile phone involvement, and MWD (initiating, monitoring/reading, and responding to social communications). Of impulsivity facets, lower premeditation and higher positive urgency significantly predicted each MWD behaviour, while higher sensation seeking significantly predicted responding only, providing some support for differential relationships of impulsivity facets with MWD. Mobile phone involvement was a more robust predictor of MWD. Moreover, there were significant indirect effects of positive and negative urgency via mobile phone involvement for all three MWD behaviours. Findings highlight the importance of mobile phone involvement for explaining MWD which should be addressed in future studies. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Chinese classrooms, whether on school grounds or online, have long suffered from a lack of interactivity. Many online classes simply provide recorded lectures to which students listen after downloading. This format only reinforces the negative effects of passive non-participatory learning. At the e-Learning Lab of Shanghai Jiaotong University researchers and developers actively seek technologic interventions that can greatly increase interactivity in blended classes. They developed a cutting-edge mobile learning system that can deliver live broadcast of real-time classroom teaching to online students with mobile devices. Their system allows students to customise means of content-reception, based on when and where the students are tuning in to the broadcast. The system also supports short text messaging and instant polls. Through these venues, students can ask questions and make suggestions in real time, and the instructor can address them immediately. Here we describe this system in detail, and also report results from a test implementation of the system with a blended classroom of 1000 students (250 campus and 750 online).

AB  - Digital terrestrial television currently incorporates accessibility elements for the deaf (closed captions, CCs) and for the blind (audio description and audio navigation), however the deafblind population has particular accessibility needs that to date have not been met. This work presents a technical aid (a mobile application called GoAll) developed to increase the autonomy of deafblind individuals, allowing direct access to content broadcast on digital TV through the reading of CCs either with a mobile device or a Braille display. The information in this study is based on the data generated by the application server during the 5 months it was in operation in Spain as well as data from a usability survey conducted on nine deafblind individuals. The results show that 55% of the people used the application between 5 and 7 days a week and did so in the most popular time slots; those surveyed watch news, movies, documentaries, reality shows, and entertainment shows. Noteworthy is fact that all survey respondents said they felt they had greater autonomy with this application. The limitations of the proposed solution involve two elements: Braille reading (knowledge and speed of reading) and the constraints of CCs, since they are used as an input for technical assistance.

AB  - Ratings of severity and frequency of engagement with distracting driver behaviours are reported in this paper. Survey data were collected using an anonymous online questionnaire. Four hundred eighty-two respondents contributed to the survey during a 2 month data collection period. Results indicate that the three behaviours rated as most distracting when driving were (i) writing text messages (41%), (ii) reading text messages (62%), and (iii) using a cellular telephone hand-held (52%). The three most frequently reported distracting behaviours that resulted in accidents were (i) ‘interaction with child passengers’ 2.1% (near misses = 7.5%), (ii) both, route guidance destination entry with 2% (near misses = 2.8%) and use of an ‘… add-on media device, e.g., an iPod’ with 2% (near misses = 3.9%), and (iii) the three items ‘reading a text message’, ‘following advice from a route guidance system’, and ‘interaction with pets’, all with 1.7% of respondents reporting an accident when undertaking the activity (with 6.5%, 3%, and 2.2% respectively for near misses). Two hierarchical regression models were explored. The first introducing personal factors, i.e., age, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability and intellect (R² = 0.131, p < 0.001). The second controlled for variables in the first model and introduced driver-related variables, mileage, penalty points, and frequency of accidents with assumed responsibility (R² = 0.253, p < 0.001). This model identified age, extraversion, mileage, penalty points and accidents all to be significant predictors of engagement with unnecessary distractions. The data presents a picture of widespread awareness of, and engagement with, distracting behaviours by drivers in the United Kingdom. Findings from the hierarchical regressions suggest scope may exist to mediate the levels of distracting behaviours by exploring individual differences and driving styles.

AB  - Introduction: International mobility of researchers has always been a characteristic of academia. However, it became more intense in recent years. While long stays abroad are strongly promoted, their personal impact has only been rarely assessed. Objective: The aim of this study is to establish to what extent a long stay abroad influences work engagement, well-being feeling, affective organizational commitment and attitude towards future international mobility. Method: Participants included 188 researchers who responded to an online survey. Results: Results indicate that work engagement and well-being increase when the international mobility is perceived as successful. Analyzes also show that mobility perceived as voluntary and successful positively predicts favorable attitude towards future international mobility. In addition to these results, descriptive statistics report that men are more inclined to be mobile than women. Conclusion: The positive effects of the international mobility are discussed as well as its perverse effects. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - We investigated how a lack of trust in one’s romantic partner exacerbates problems such as emotional instability, conflict, or intention to break up in relationships with the role of cell phone snooping as a mediator. A cross-sectional survey of married individuals (n = 329) was conducted using an online questionnaire. Results indicate that lack of trust is a significant predictor of romantic relationship problems. In addition, structural equation modeling results support the theoretical model indicating that cell phone snooping partially mediates the significant relationship between emotional instability, intention to break up, and conflicts. Findings support the development of trust in romantic partners as an approach to stability and avoidance of problems in romantic relationships.

AB  - ABSTRACT We investigated the impact of color salience and location of a website link on users’ performance, affective experiences and approach-avoidance tendencies with 10 mock mobile Web directories. Task completion times were recorded by a computer program, and users’ affective experiences and approach-avoidance responses were reported in questionnaires. Results implied that visual attention in the display area on a mobile Web directory is directed by a combination of bottom-up and top-down processes, which is different from the primarily top-down process implicated in a similar study of PC Web directories. A salient color of the website link helped attract users’ attention and increase users’ sense of control over the process. Also, users are likely to search webpages from top left to bottom right. Our findings suggest that a target website link placed in the top left corner or displayed in a distinct color in the center area not only attracts users’ attention but also results in a more highly rated affective experience. Color of the target website link can be changed to increase users’ sense of control of a Web directory and approach behaviors. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - There has been increasing interest in informal learning in recent years alongside interest in how such learning can be supported by technology. However, relatively little is known about the extent to which adults make use of their own mobile devices to support informal learning. In this study, a survey was used to investigate whether, and to what extent, experienced users of mobile devices use their mobile devices to support intentional informal learning. If so, do they make use of mobile device connectivity to support opportunistic informal learning and does such connectivity support or encourage collaborative informal learning? Experienced mobile device users were recruited from web forums and business, and asked whether they used their devices to support informal learning. A pattern of learning uses emerged, some of which deployed the mobile device capabilities relatively unchanged, others triggered adaptations to typical learning activities to provide a better fit to the needs of the learner. These informal learning activities provided the basis for the design of a flexible mobile learning framework that can be extended to support developments in mobile technology, and increasing use of Web 2.0 technologies by informal learners.

AB  - This paper introduces a new perspective on information behavior in Web 2.0 environments, including the role of mobile access in bridging formal to informal learning. Kuhlthau’s (1991, 2007) Information Search Process (ISP) model is identified as a theoretical basis for exploring Information Seeking attitudes and behaviors, while social learning and literacy concepts of Vygotsky (1962, 1978), Bruner (1962, 1964) and Jenkins (2010) are identified as foundations for Information Sharing. The Guided Inquiry Spaces model (Maniotes, 2005) is proposed as an approach to bridging the student’s informal learning world and the curriculum-based teacher’s world. Research within this framework is operationalized through a recently validated Information and Communications Technology Learning (ICTL) survey instrument measuring learners’ preferences for self-expression, sharing, and knowledge acquisition interactions in technology-pervasive environments. Stepwise refinement of ICTL produced two reliable and valid psychometric scales, Information Sharing (alpha = .77) and Information Seeking (alpha = .72). Cross-validation with an established Mobile Learning Scale (Khaddage & Knezek, 2013) indicates that Information Sharing aligns significantly (p < .05) with Mobile Learning. Information Seeking, Information Sharing, and mobile access are presented as important, complimentary components important, complimentary components in the shift along the formal to informal learning continuum. Therefore, measures of these constructs can assist in understanding students’ preferences for 21st century learning. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study tested the hypothesis as to whether the mode and time of information technology use—such as using various electronic and computing devices for gambling and collecting information related to gambling—can positively predict disordered gambling, with the effects of Internet gaming addiction and illusory control being taken into account. A questionnaire set was administered to 677 Hong Kong secondary school students to assess their maladaptive gambling behavior, Internet gaming addiction, illusory control, and the habit of information technology use, such as the amount of time spent on watching television, browsing the Internet, and playing online gambling and non-gambling games. The results suggest that utilizing computing and electronic devices for gambling-related activities is positively indicative of disordered gambling, making use of information technology for work or study being a buffering factor. Utilizing information technology for non-gambling activities—such as the durations of playing non-gambling games and making non-gambling purchases online—is not related to disordered gambling, albeit their positive correlations with Internet gaming addiction. Likewise, Internet gaming addiction has no association with using information technology devices for any gambling-related activities, except its very small correlation with playing online gambling games. In addition, tablet computers may provide a convenient means for gambling activities and tend to be used by problem gamblers. It is recommended that intervention strategies targeted at secondary school students should address not only the amount of use but also the way they use information technology devices.

AB  - This study takes place from the idea that the personal usage of mobile technologies can bring positive outcomes to the user and to their society in an indirect way. Technologies studied in this work are defined as persuasive technologies (Fogg, 1997) because they are intentionally designed to modify the users’ attitude or behavior. This research is aimed to evaluate if the intention to use the application can be influenced by positive attitudes toward technology, by the persuasive power of the application and by the perceived fun. Participants (N = 118; M = 55; F = 63; mean age = 27.4; range age = 15–69) filled in an online questionnaire that was partly based on the Media and Technology Usage and Attitude Scale (MTUAS—Rosen et al., 2013). An additional eight items were added to the scale, aimed at evaluating participants’ technophobia, technophilia, perceived technology pervasiveness and perceived persuasive power of technology. By using linear regression analysis, it was found that the application’s informational power and the perceived entertainment positively influenced the usage intention. Another interesting result, obtained through ANOVA, concerns a generational difference: baby boomers tended to trust more the fact that the single individual action through the application can have an effective impact on the environment. These results represent a basis for future in-depth investigations about socially relevant use of the ICT. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Rapid advances in tablet technology and the increasing availability of electronic survey applications provide opportunities to streamline on-site human dimensions data collection. This article compares response rates and cost efficiencies of an iPad interface used for on-site survey administration to other types of human dimensions of wildlife survey administration response rates and expenses. Results also illustrate respondents' interface preference from a recent survey administered at National Wildlife Refuges and National Parks across the United States. Refuge and Park visitors enjoyed taking on-site surveys on iPads more than traditional paper surveys, and indicated a preference for taking future surveys on iPads instead of paper (t = 21.64, p < .001, η = .39); iPad survey administration was more cost efficient for large (over 1,350) survey samples, and garnered a higher than average response rate than online and mail surveys, but similar to average response rates for on-site intercept survey administration.

AB  - Background: What, when, how, how much, and how often infants are fed have been associated with childhood obesity risk. The objective of this secondary analysis was to examine the effect of a responsive parenting (RP) intervention designed for obesity prevention on parents’ infant feeding practices in the first year after birth. Methods: Primiparous mother-newborn dyads were randomized to the Intervention Nurses Start Infants Growing on Healthy Trajectories (INSIGHT) Study RP intervention or child safety control. Research nurses delivered intervention content at home at infant age 3–4, 16, 28, and 40 weeks, and at a research center at 1 year. RP feeding guidance advised feeding that was contingent (i.e., feed in response to hunger and satiety signs, alternatives to using food to soothe), and developmentally appropriate (i.e., delaying introduction of solids, age-appropriate portion sizes). Infant feeding practices (i.e., bottle use, introduction of solids, food to soothe) were assessed by phone interviews and online surveys and dietary intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire. Results: RP mothers were more likely to use of structure-based feeding practices including limit-setting (p < 0.05) and consistent feeding routines (p < 0.01) at age 1 year. RP group mothers were less likely to use non-responsive feeding practices such as pressuring their infant to finish the bottle/food (p < 0.001), and using food to soothe (p < 0.01), propping the bottle (p < 0.05) assessed between 4 and 8 months, and putting baby to bed with a bottle at age 1 year (p < 0.05). Few differences were seen between groups in what specific foods or food groups infants were fed. Conclusions: Anticipatory guidance on RP in feeding can prevent the use of food to soothe and promote use of more sensitive, structure-based feeding which could reduce obesity risk by affecting how and when infants are fed during the first year.

AB  - Das Schlagwort "Smart Home" verspricht eine intelligente, hilfreiche Umgebung, in der die Technik das Leben der Bewohner erleichtert, vereinfacht oder sicherer macht. Auf technischer Ebene wird dies derzeit durch viele vernetzte Geräte erreicht, die miteinander interagieren und mit gemeinsamen Protokollen und Standards arbeiten. Aus Sicht der Benutzererfahrung (UX) ist die Interaktion mit einer solchen Ansammlung von Geräten jedoch so komplex geworden, dass sie einer breiten Akzeptanz und Nutzung derzeit eher im Wege steht. Bisher scheint es unwahrscheinlich, dass sich ein gemeinsames Konzept für die Benutzerschnittstelle (UI) als Quasi-Standard herausbilden wird, wie es bei der Desktop-Schnittstelle für grafische UIs der Fall war. Daher verfolgt unsere Forschung einen anderen Ansatz. Anstelle vieler einzelner intelligenter Geräte stellen wir uns ein UI-Konzept für intelligente Umgebungen vor, das verschiedene Technologien in ein kohärentes mentales Modell einer verkörperten "Raumintelligenz" (RI) integriert. Die RI wird intelligente Maschinen, mobile Roboterarme und alltägliche physische Objekte miteinander verbinden und so die Grenzen zwischen der physischen und der digitalen Welt verwischen. Der vorliegende Beitrag beschreibt unsere Vision und die sich daraus ergebenden Forschungsfragen und stellt die ersten Schritte der technischen Umsetzung vor. (translated by DeepL)
AB  - The buzzword "smart home" promises an intelligent, helpful environment in which technology makes life easier, simpler or safer for its inhabitants. On a technical level, this is currently achieved by many networked devices interacting with each other, working on shared protocols and standards. From a user experience (UX) perspective, however, the interaction with such a collection of devices has become so complex that it currently rather stands in the way of widespread adoption and use. So far, it does not seem likely that a common user interface (UI) concept will emerge as a quasi-standard, as the desktop interface did for graphical UIs. Therefore, our research follows a different approach. Instead of many singular intelligent devices, we envision a UI concept for smart environments that integrates diverse pieces of technology in a coherent mental model of an embodied "room intelligence" (RI). RI will combine smart machinery, mobile robotic arms and mundane physical objects, thereby blurring the line between the physical and the digital world. The present paper describes our vision and emerging research questions and presents the initial steps of technical realization.

AB  - Aims: This study comprised part of a larger cross-sectional survey performed in Hungary in the period 2005–2006, which was designed first to reveal the representative age-, gender- and height-specific percentile values for the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in Hungarian children aged 11–16 years. The second aim was to determine the prevalence of overweight and obesity. Methods: Analyses were performed on 14 290 Hungarian children aged 11–16 years. All blood pressure (BP) measurements were made with a validated, automated, digital device. The criteria recommended by international guidelines were used. Results: The prevalence of overweight and obesity among the Hungarian children was found to be 23.4% (3347 adolescents; International Obesity Task Force criteria). Previous studies have reported that the strongest correlation is observed between the BP values and weight, and our results are in accordance with this. Conclusions: Regional differences in morphometry (different prevalences of overweight and obesity) and the genetic background, disparate eating habits and other cultural factors may account for the differences in BP levels during childhood. As the prevalence of overweight and obesity is increasing worldwide, it is important that countries carefully monitor the weight and BP status of their children and adolescents.

AB  - Abstract Objective This study surveyed the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the audiology workplace. Design The study used a cross-sectional survey design for audiologists across the globe (n = 337) using an online survey (June–August 2020) focussing on changes to the workplace during the pandemic. Results Participants represented varied work settings and audiology services. Only a third (31.5%) provided psychosocial support, which may be important during the pandemic, as part of their services. Almost all (97%) audiologists reported changes to their workplace, with 76.4% reporting reduced caseloads during the COVID-19 pandemic. When rating their current and anticipated work conditions, 38.7% reported reduced working hours although only 13.8% anticipated reduced working hours in 6-months’ time. Audiologists ranked services such as access to hearing assessment, hearing device adjustment and maintenance, and general audiological support as being more important during the pandemic than services such as psychosocial, emotional and tinnitus support. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant disruptions to audiological practice that highlights the need to adapt and incorporate new audiological practices including telehealth, to ensure patients have continued access to care and clinics remain sustainable during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and recovery phase.

AB  - Internet survey data collection was introduced at the end of 1980's with email surveys. In the mid 1990's, the World Wide Web (WWW) began to be used for survey data collection and this is the most widely spread form today. In the last few years, we face the integration of technologies resulting in WebTV or digital TV surveys, M-CASI—computer assisted self-interviewing using mobile phone devices, and other integrated solutions (e.g., integrated CATI—computer assisted telephone interviewing systems). In this chapter, we refer to the form of Internet surveys that are most often used today, which is web surveys that are computerized, self-administered questionnaires (CSAQ) answered without the presence of an interviewer.

AB  - With the adoption and popularization of internet-based platforms, sports betting has introduced new functionalities that transform the design of its products and therefore the way bettors interact with them. This study aims to explore the association between the use of new structural characteristics of online betting and gambling severity. Five characteristics are examined here: (i) live in-play betting; (ii) cash out feature use (as example of in-play betting in-built features); (iii) fantasy sports gaming; (iv) location of betting; and (v) device or platform used to make bets. A cohort (N = 659) of Spanish gamblers who had bet on sports during the previous year was recruited through an online survey. The results suggested that those bettors scoring higher on gambling problems also utilized more often such new structural characteristics, in a proportion not explained only by their higher overall gambling activity. Mobile betting was especially frequent among problem gamblers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Context awareness is a very large research domain, encompassing many issues ranging from physical measurement of a given situation to the question of social acceptance. It appears as one of the most promising technologies to evolve current communication services into fluid, flexible, automagic, intuitive communication means. We review in this article the various applications of context awareness to convergent interpersonal communication services, making clear the evolutionary potential introduced by these techniques, from the classical digital phone network to truly smart services, many of which remain to be invented.

AB  - Background: The Stand Up Victoria multi-component intervention successfully reduced workplace sitting time in both the short (three months) and long (12 months) term. To further understand how this intervention worked, we aimed to assess the impact of the intervention on four social-cognitive constructs, and examined whether these constructs mediated intervention effects on workplace sitting time at 3 and 12 months post-baseline. Methods: Two hundred and thirty one office-based workers (14 worksites, single government employer) were randomised to intervention or control conditions by worksite. The intervention comprised organisational, environmental, and individual level elements. Participant characteristics and social-cognitive constructs (perceived behavioural control, barrier self-efficacy, perceived organisational norms and knowledge) were measured through a self-administered online survey at baseline, 3 months and 12 months. Workplace sitting time (min/8 h day) was measured with the activPAL3 device. Single multi-level mediation models were performed for each construct at both time points. Results: There were significant intervention effects at 3 months on perceived behavioural control, barrier self-efficacy and perceived organisational norms. Effects on perceived organisational norms were not significant at 12 months. Perceived behavioural control significantly mediated intervention effects at 3 months, accounting for a small portion of the total effect (indirect effect: −8.6 min/8 h day, 95% CI: −18.5, −3.6 min; 7.5% of total effect). At 12 months, barrier self-efficacy significantly mediated the intervention effects on workplace sitting time (indirect effect: −10.3 min/8 h day, 95% CI: −27.3, −2.2; 13.9% of total effect). No significant effects were observed for knowledge at either time point. Conclusions: Strategies that aim to increase workers’ perceived control and self-efficacy over their sitting time may be helpful components of sedentary behaviour interventions in the workplace. However, social-cognitive factors only partially explain variation in workplace sitting reduction. Understanding the importance of other levels of influence (particularly interpersonal and environmental) for initiating and maintaining workplace sedentary behaviour change will be informative for intervention development and refinement.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine the factors that influence social presence and user satisfaction with Mobile Instant Messaging (mIM). The proposed research model integrates channel expansion, social influence, social presence and media richness theories, to explain how user experience, social influence, and medium richness influence social presence and user satisfaction with mIM. A total of 239 students from a state university in the US participated in this study. Data was collected via a web-based survey. The results suggest that user experience, social influence, and perceived richness are important drivers for social presence and user satisfaction in mIM. The implications of the study findings are discussed in the paper. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This paper is applying a semi-explorative approach using both ethnosemantic in-depth interviewing, as well as a survey among 119 installers followed by a statistical analysis. The findings show that particular installers that carry out repair jobs are highly m-communication relevant. They have low internet usage, their devices are newer than average and the usage of network-independent features are higher than average. Furthermore, company-paid phones seem to stimulate phone usage during work. However, there do not seem to be any work-relevant nonvoice services available. Nevertheless, the interest and demand for work-related services will increase as the general adoption increases. A large part of the target audience is already exhibiting high interest in manufacturer-produced, work-related mobile services.Journal of Brand Management (2008) 16, 51–62. doi:10.1057/bm.2008.19; published online 6 June 2008 [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Children are growing up in a digital age with increasing exposure to television and touchscreen devices. We tested whether exposure to screen media is associated with children’s early language development. One hundred and thirty-one highly educated caregivers of UK children aged 6–36 months completed a media exposure questionnaire and vocabulary measure. 99% of children were read to daily, 82% watched television, and 49% used mobile touchscreen devices daily. Regression analyses revealed that time spent reading positively predicted vocabulary comprehension and production scores at 6–18 months, but time spent engaging with television or mobile touchscreen devices was not associated with vocabulary scores. Critically, correlations revealed that time spent reading or engaging with other non-screen activities was not offset by time spent engaging with television or mobile touchscreen devices. Thus, there was no evidence to suggest that screen media exposure adversely influenced vocabulary size in our sample of highly educated families with moderate media use. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study investigated the effects of implementing an online instant response system 'Kahoot!' in an Earth Science class in a rural area of Taiwan. The study adopted the mixed-methods approach, based primarily on a quasi-experimental approach, to investigate the effects. The participants were randomly grouped into two classes, with Kahoot! as the intervention. The seventh-grade junior high school students were instructed by the same teacher. The research questions were whether the mobile technology impacted students' learning motivation and achievement and how the learning processes proceeded. Data were collected through surveys, student assignments, exams, learning journals, and interviews. The results indicated that the implementation of 'Kahoot!' can enhance these rural-area students' learning motivation, gain the rural-area students' attention, and create incentives for the students to preview and review learning materials promoting learning efficiency. Moreover, the integration enhanced learning achievement. On the other hand, the teachable moments Kahoot! created may not be sustainable. It is hoped that the research findings can provide teachers with implications and guidelines to successfully integrate mobile technologies to enhance learning in their classrooms.

AB  - The viewing of television programming on screens other than a television set has become increasingly common. This article discusses the different modes of viewing that have emerged as a result of timeshifting, downloading, streaming and mobile technologies. Using data collected from an online survey (n = 671) over a six-month period in 2010–2011, we present a descriptive and inferential statistical analysis of both traditional and emerging modes of viewing. We also examine whether significant differences exist across three demographic variables: gender, age and country or region of residence. Our findings show that while the majority of viewing still takes place in front of a television screen, the computer has achieved secondary screen status among North Americans and equal status among younger viewers and Europeans. Viewing on a mobile device remains minimal across all demographics. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

AB  - Loneliness is a prevalent phenomenon within the older adult population. Previous literature suggests that technology use, specifically internet use, can alleviate loneliness and improve wellbeing. This research study follows 32 people over the age of 65 using a digital technology for six months. A mixed-method approach was used to collect quantitative and qualitative data throughout the time period. The repeated questionnaire measured changes in frequency of use, emotional attachment towards a device, a sense of belonging and perceptions of self-worth, whilst an event-based diary was used to note usages and influences of technology on lifestyle. Results revealed positive relationships between frequency of use and emotional attachment and frequency of use and perceptions of self-worth. There was no significant relationship between frequency of use and a sense of belonging for the aggregate data. There was, however, a negative relationship between emotional attachment towards a device and a sense of belonging, suggesting a fine balance between technology use to improve self-esteem through connections with social networks and an over-dependence on technology that can actually reduce feelings of belonging.

AB  - Despite an emerging trend of location check-ins as a means of mobile communication amongst Facebook users, little attention has been devoted to the value of location check-ins as marketing potential. In particular, little is known about how mobile users process and assess location information shared by their friends on Facebook. Undergirded by persuasion knowledge and elaboration likelihood models, a self-instructed online survey with 255 undergraduate students found that friendship tie strength was positively correlated with students' attitudes towards and perceived credibility of the location information shared by their Facebook friends. However, this relationship was true of those who reported a high level of mobile phone competence rather than those with low mobile phone competence. Prior experience with location sharing on Facebook was also positively correlated with students' evaluations of the location information. Theoretical and practical implications were discussed.

AB  - While the choice of matrix versus item-by-item questions has received considerable attention in the literature, it is still unclear in what situation one is better than the other. Building upon the previous findings, this study expands this line of research by examining whether the difference between the two question types is moderated by the number of response options. Through a web survey experiment, this study compares matrix and item-by-item questions with 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, and 11 response options. Additionally, we also investigate the impact of the device used to complete the survey on data quality. The results show that straight lining and response time are similar between the two question types across all response lengths, but item nonresponse tends to be higher for matrix than item-by-item question, especially among mobile respondents. Also measurement models reveal measurement equivalence between the two question types when there are fewer than seven response options. For matrices with 9 or 11 response options, analyses reveal substantial differences compared to item-by-item questions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The purpose of the study described in this chapter was to survey Gen Y job seekers in order to gain a clearer understanding of the expectations of the recruitment process. Specifically, this study focused on the pre employment phase that is likely to begin during on-campus interviews, at a career fair, or over the phone. The aim of this study was to inform organizations that seek to attract Gen Y workers about what is important during the pre employment phase. Based on this notion, the following four conclusions were drawn as evidenced by the empirical and qualitative results and implications discussed previously. In order to maintain high procedural justice perceptions, organizations must treat candidates fairly by informing them about how information is gathered during the pre employment phase. As an example, many of the Gen Y candidates desire to know more about how information is gathered: will the organization conduct a web search, will they conduct a search on Facebook, will they call personal and professional references, and the like.

AB  - Background: The electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) JUUL has quickly captured the ENDS market, representing 74.6% of the total dollar share for this category as of November 2018. Although JUUL is marketed as an alternative to cigarettes intended for current adult smokers, evidence suggests that a majority of ENDS users are concurrently current cigarette smokers. Little is known about the dual use of JUUL and cigarettes, as well as the reasons for trying JUUL among adult tobacco users. Methods: A survey fielded via web and phone of 1332 current cigarette, cigar, little cigar or cigarillo (CLCC), and ENDS users aged 18–54 years was conducted from March to May 2018. Weighted descriptive and bivariate analyses examined JUUL use and reasons for trying JUUL by demographics, combustible tobacco use, ENDS use and intention to quit. Results: Approximately 81% of our sample reported current use of two or more tobacco products, including cigarettes, CLCCs or ENDS. Among current tobacco users, 15% ever used JUUL and 12% used JUUL in the past 30 days. Most individuals (74%) reporting ever JUUL use indicated using it for 5 days or fewer in the past 30 days. The most common reason for trying JUUL was trying to quit smoking cigarettes (37%), followed by family, friends or colleagues using the product (32%). Conclusion: Although some tobacco users may be initiating JUUL to decrease combustible use, most were using the product infrequently and concurrently with other products.

AB  - Little is known about the psychological underpinnings of young people’s mobile phone behaviour. In the present research, 292 young Australians, aged 16–24 years, completed an online survey assessing the effects of self-identity, in-group norm, the need to belong, and self-esteem on their frequency of mobile phone use and mobile phone involvement, conceptualised as people’s degree of cognitive and behavioural association with their mobile phone. Structural equation modelling revealed that age (younger) and self-identity significantly predicted the frequency of mobile phone use. In contrast, age (younger), gender (female), self-identity and in-group norm predicted young people’s mobile phone involvement. Neither self-esteem nor the need to belong significantly predicted mobile phone behaviour. The present study contributes to our understanding of this phenomenon and provides an indication of the characteristics of young people who may become highly involved with their mobile phone.

AB  - Reports an error in 'Language learner perspectives on the functionality and use of electronic language dictionaries' by Mike Levy and Caroline Steel (ReCALL: Journal of Eurocall, Advanced Online Publication, Jan 5, 2015, np). The authors would like to amend two incorrect attributions. The first attribution to be corrected is in the first sentence after the heading ‘2 Language dictionaries: Perspectives on use and design’. The second attribution to be corrected is in the second sentence of the sixth paragraph following the heading ‘2.2 Functionality’, which reads 'In a large-scale survey on dictionary use, Granger (2012b: 445, 448) found that...' The corrections to these attributions, as well as a correction to the end reference, are provided in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2015-15050-001[/rid].) Abstract This paper investigates the extent of electronic dictionary use by language learners in an Australian university. All students in the study are formally enrolled in language courses across ten languages at first, second or third year level. The study places a particular emphasis on gauging student perceptions of the beneficial aspects of electronic dictionaries as judged by learners themselves in circumstances where they are able to act independently. As these benefits are often described in terms of usability and functionality, these particular terms are defined and introduced in the literature review, and then later they are employed to help structure and describe the results. The arguments for the discussion are supported by the use of empirical data taken from a large-scale survey conducted in 2011 (n=587) where comments from students were obtained on why and how dictionary-type resources were accessed and used (see also Steel & Levy, 2013). The paper restricts itself to the quantitative and qualitative data gathered on mobile phones, translators, dictionaries and web conjugators and related items (e.g. discussion forums). The particular functions that students use and the ways in which they use them are described and categorised, with the discussion supported by student comments. The data exhibits a remarkable range of resources available to students to look up unknown words or to see translations and, consequently, our understanding of what exactly an electronic dictionary might comprise is challenged. Many students’ comments demonstrate a sophistication and knowledge about the effective use of these dictionary tools together with a keen awareness of their limitations.

AB  - Combined with the ubiquity and constant connectivity of mobile devices, and with innovative approaches such as Data-Driven Learning (DDL), Natural Language Processing Technologies (NLPTs) as Open Educational Resources (OERs) could become a powerful tool for language learning as they promote individual and personalized learning. Using a questionnaire that was answered by language teachers (n = 230) in Spain and the UK, this research explores the extent to which OER NLPTs are currently known and used in adult foreign language learning. Our results suggest that teachers’ familiarity and use of OER NLPTs are very low. Although online dictionaries, collocation dictionaries and spell checkers are widely known, NLPTs appear to be generally underused in foreign language teaching. It was found that teachers prefer computer-based environments over mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets and that teachers’ qualification determines their familiarity with a wider range of OER NLPTs. This research offers insight into future applications of Language Processing Technologies as OERs in language learning. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Participants increasingly use mobile devices, especially smartphones, to fill out online questionnaires. However, standard questionnaire templates are often not optimized for presentation on smartphones, raising the question of whether an unfavorable layout may influence the survey results. In this study, interaction with questionnaires on different devices was investigated regarding processing time, data quality, and user experience of the questionnaire itself. Several standard and newly developed questionnaire layout templates were evaluated by means of an online study (N = 301). Results show that processing times are higher on smartphones compared to desktop computers. However, there were no differences regarding data quality. The comparison of different mobile layouts among smartphone users revealed effects on processing time and user experience. Design recommendations are derived.

AB  - This study compared learner perspectives regarding using PCs and smartphones as learning devices. A total of 167 Korean university students completed online assignments designed to maximize interaction with these devices. The assignments required students to submit their responses regarding assigned reading passages for a semester. Then they completed an online survey of five questions: (a) most frequently used device; (b) reasons for favoring a particular device; (c) limitations of a particular device; (d) better device for facilitating cognitive effort; (e) places where they used a particular device. The results showed that half the participants used PCs and the other half used smartphones. PC users favored ‘comfortable use,’ whereas smartphone users favored ‘ubiquitous learning.’ PC users reported ‘not easily portable’ was the most prominent limitation, whereas smartphone users pointed out ‘using smartphone's costly data’ and ‘uncomfortable to drag/move’ were noticeable limitations. In general however, the majority of both PC and smartphone users reported no limitations in using these devices as learning tools. Regarding facilitating cognitive effort, around 38.0% of participants indicated that there was no difference between these two devices. Most PC users did online assignments either at home or in a dormitory. Smartphone users completed tasks in several different places. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In Malaysian schools the learning of science does not reflect the nature of science. An instructional module which could address the need for teaching science through a process of scientific discovery and collaboration is required. A developmental research approach with three phases was used to design a collaborative m-Learning module for a topic in science. In the first phase of analysis, a survey of 158 students’ use of technology and the perception of the use of computers and mobile phones was completed. Data from the analysis phase indicated the students’ readiness in using online tools such as discussion forums and text messaging with mobiles for learning. Computers were perceived to be useful for learning, but mobile phones were not. The findings from the first phase were used to determine the learning tools to utilize in the design of the module in the second phase. The online learning tools used are wikis and discussion forums. In addition, text messaging using the mobile phone was also employed for individualized quizzes. The collaborative m-Learning module designed, was evaluated by experts for further improvements. The findings indicate that the experts agree that a collaborative Learning module with a variety of learning tools such as wikis, discussion forum and text messaging, could be used for teaching science. In addition, this module could also be used for teaching other subjects. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Digital mobile devices such as iPads have been around for many years and have been more and more popular in K-12 classrooms. Research has pointed out the advantages of using iPads in classrooms to enhance teaching, engage learning, and promote learning outcomes. iPads have been proven to be a useful and powerful digital mobile device in language learning including speaking, listening, reading, and writing. The purpose of the study was to investigate whether a technology integrated twenty-first century writing workshop had an influence on the ability and attitude towards writing in Chinese for second graders enrolled in the Mandarin Chinese program in a language immersion elementary school. Twenty-four students participated in the study. Recording technology (iPad recording app), an iPad camera, and the Book Creator App were integrated into the twenty-first century writing workshop. A pre-survey, post-survey, and observation were used to collect data. The results of the study confirmed that writing barriers decreased when the Chinese immersion program students utilized iPads in the writing workshop. Also, the writing ability and attitudes of the Chinese immersion program students improved after the completion of their twenty-first century writing workshop.

AB  - Portable electronic dictionaries (PEDs) are modern digital learning aids that exploit digitalization for the purpose of increasing learners' proficiency in English as well as independent learning. The Mobile Dictionaries Study (MobiDic-Study) is an investigation into the effects of PEDs on the language competence and dictionary skills of low performing learners of English. The study also provides valuable insights into attitudes towards PEDs and the effect of their habitual use on L2 learning motivation. The PED has a moderately positive effect on the learning of a foreign language in such areas as language awareness, lexical errors, learning habits, attitudes towards learning, and vocabulary growth. Findings demonstrate that dictionary skills require explicit training as they do not develop automatically during recurring PED use. The study implements a comparative design since users of PEDs are compared with users of printed dictionaries (PDs). A total of 186 14-year-old students took part in the study. The longitudinal study draws data from various sources. A standardized reading comprehension test was used to assess the effect of PEDs and PDs on reading comprehension. In the pre- and the post-test phases PED users perform slightly better than PD users. During the test a procedure was in place that tracked the number of look-ups. The results suggest that consultations may be more frequent with PEDs, yet consultation is by no means excessive. Another area of interest concerns the development of learners' vocabulary knowledge over the period of the intervention. Two instruments were exclusively designed for the purpose of monitoring learners' lexical growth during the period of PED availability. The Vocabulary Size Test (VST) was adapted into a shorter, bilingual (German-English) version. A second vocabulary test draws test items from the course books that are in use at the participating schools. For PED users a greater vocabulary expansion can be attested than for PD users, which might be explained by an increased rate of exposure due to PED usage, thereby leading to higher retention. In order to assess PED use and the impact of PEDs on learners' text production skills, a qualitative video case study was conducted among 12 students working in pairs. Two learners each were asked to write a text about their school, using a PED whenever they wished to do so. In addition, they were asked to explain particular consultations during the writing process and to give their overall opinion about the effectiveness of PED use. Moreover, one learner, who is experienced in using PEDs, explains the use of the PED to a novice, making it possible to tap learners' dictionary skills in a non-invasive manner. The transcripts of these 90-minute sessions with six pairs of learners were analysed with qualitative content analysis techniques. Results were interpreted against the backdrop of a model of dictionary consultation proposed by Engelberg and Lemnitzer (2009f, 94f.). From all consultations generated by the writing task, 39 out of these 83 look-ups have led to accurate production of English text. Only 8 errors resulted from inappropriate PED use. Although the risk of PED-induced errors is real, analysis of the learner texts reveals that the reservations concerning PEDs as reference tools doing more harm than good, are unfounded (cf. Diehr 2016). Questionnaire data reveal a positive long-term attitude towards PED use and a boost in L2 learning motivation. This is a crucial finding since low-achieving learners in secondary schools are often acutely aware of their own language deficits, harbouring a self-image of "the inadequate language learner" (cf. Helmke et al. 2008, 249). The PED, however, boosted their confidence, especially when the learners found answers to specific lexical problems. In addition to learner data, the teachers' perspective has been included as well. Semi-standardized interviews were conducted with all four teachers using PEDs in their EFL classes. The teachers are positive about the fact that learners have continuous access to PEDs during lessons, noting that learners have grown in their language learning autonomy. Rather than asking the teacher repeatedly for help, learners would resort to their PEDs for quick answers during reading and writing tasks as well as in class discussions. The research points to the need to make the PED itself an object of study with activities focussed on PED use. It has been found that PED users need opportunities to develop dictionary skills in a systematic approach. These PED-specific skills include knowledge about the most important features of a dictionary entry and the relevant abbreviations. The effectiveness of PED use can be increased considerably if the innovative consultation functions (e. g. cross-checking) are brought to the awareness of learners and teachers.

AB  - The CAL09 conference had as its central focus ‘learning in digital worlds’, both real and virtual. In that sense many of the papers in this special reflect key concepts of co-operation, interaction and dynamism—a sense of operating in learning spaces rather than one of being operated on. At CAL09 the topics under discussion largely focused on the student experience of this innovation; both as a tool for learning and for assessment. The changing roles of key educational stakeholders, pupils, parents and teachers are brought to the fore in the papers of this issue. The articles present research questions and methodologies in the variety of contexts from artificial intelligent design, to blended learning in HE, interactivity in school classrooms settings, and mobile learning in physical and virtual worlds.

AB  - Despite the growing number of digital apps designed to teach coding skills to young children, we know little about their effectiveness. To formally explore this question, we conducted a naturalistic observation of a one-week program designed to teach foundational coding skills (i.e., sequencing, conditions, loops) to young children (N = 28, Mage = 5.15 years) using two tablet applications: Daisy the Dinosaur and Kodable. Pre- and post-assessments measured familiarity with technology, appeal of coding apps, knowledge of Daisy commands, ability to play Kodable, and conceptual understanding of coding. Participants improved in their knowledge of Daisy commands (i.e., move, grow, jump) and Kodable gameplay (i.e., placing arrows in the correct sequence to move a character through a maze), but did not improve in their ability to verbally explain what coding is. Appeal of the games was significantly related to children's learning of Daisy commands, but child gender was not related to either Daisy or Kodable learning outcomes. Results suggest that young children can learn foundational coding skills via apps, especially when the apps are appealing to children. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Using Rogers’ diffusion of innovation model, this study examined the relationships between lifestyles and the adoption of six new technologies in Taiwan. Three of the six technologies—notebooks, netbooks, and tablet PCs—are information technologies, while the remaining three technologies—Wii, Kinect, and digital videos (DVs)—are entertainment technologies. A telephone survey was adopted to obtain a representative sample, which obtained 1157 valid calls with a response rate of 53.1%. Two conclusions are drawn from the data analysis. First, lifestyles did play a significant role in predicting the adoption of the six technologies. Second, this study found that demographics and mass media use were more predictive of the adoption of information technologies than that of the adoption of entertainment technologies.

AB  - This chapter describes case studies conducted in five European countries, where language learners were invited to use 'LingoBee,' a mobile app, as a means of supporting their language learning. Assuming that today’s language learners are mobile savvy and 'Digital Natives' and that they should be able to engage in language learning autonomously using technology, initial studies were conducted with little or no intervention by the language teachers. However, the support and guidance provided within a teacher-led context can impact positively on learner engagement. The case studies confirm this hypothesis. This chapter addresses the research question: Does the level of the support and guidance and pedagogical approach impact on learners’ engagement and the synergy between formal and informal learning? Based on the experiences from the five case studies, recommendations are provided for teachers and designers of educational technologies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This paper describes three case studies, where language learners were invited to use 'LingoBee' as a means of supporting their language learning. LingoBee is a mobile app that provides user-generated language content in a cloud-based shared repository. Assuming that today’s students are mobile savvy and 'Digital Natives' able to engage in language learning autonomously using technology, initial studies were conducted with little or no intervention by the language teachers. However, the support and guidance provided within a teacher-led context can impact positively on learner engagement and use of LingoBee. The authors discuss this hypothesis using three case studies conducted in three European countries, within the EU LLP project SIMOLA, Situated Mobile Language Learning. This paper answers the research question: Does the level of the support and guidance, pedagogical approach and prior learning impact on learners’ engagement and use of LingoBee?

AB  - As an indispensable part of their lives, mobile has been playing an important role among undergraduate students in influencing their lives and academic studies. Although gender has been proven to be an important factor in distinguishing males and females in using the internet and other digital media, what are the gender differences in mobile use and habits? The authors of this chapter offer an updated answer to that question by surveying a selected sample of undergraduate students in Turkey. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background and Objectives: The home literacy environment has been identified as a key predictor of children’s language, school readiness, academic achievement, and behavioral outcomes. With the increased accessibility and consumption of digital media, it is important to understand whether screen use impacts off-line enrichment activities such as reading or whether reading activities offset screen use. Using a prospective birth cohort, we examined reading and screen use at 24, 36, and 60 months to elucidate the directional association between screen use and reading over time. Methods: This study included data from 2440 mothers and children in Calgary, Alberta, drawn from the All Our Families cohort. Children’s screen use and reading activities were assessed via maternal report at age 24, 36, and 60 months. Sociodemographic covariates were also collected. Results: Using a random-intercepts cross-lagged panel model, which statistically controls for individual-level confounds, this study revealed that greater screen use at 24 months was associated with lower reading at 36 months (β = 2.08; 95% confidence interval: 20.13 to 20.02). In turn, lower reading at 36 months was associated with greater screen use at 60 months (β = 2.11; 95% confidence interval: 20.19 to 20.02). Covariates did not modify the associations. Conclusions: A reciprocal relationship between screen use and reading was identified. Early screen use was associated with lower reading activities, resulting in greater screen use at later ages. Findings emphasize the need for practitioners and educators to discuss screen use guidelines and encourage families to engage in device-free activities to foster early literacy exposure.

AB  - Objective: We aimed to replicate the concurrent validity of a comprehensive definition of eating disorder recovery (physical, behavioral, and cognitive indices) in a sample followed up 7–8 years from baseline, and to examine, for the first time with this comprehensive definition, predictive validity. Method: Participants were 66 women with a history of an eating disorder and 31 age-matched controls who completed an online survey and phone interview. Results: In general, women who were fully recovered were statistically indistinguishable from controls and had significantly less eating disorder attitudes and behaviors than the partially recovered and eating disorder groups. Being fully recovered at baseline was a robust predictor of stability: of those fully recovered at baseline, 80% remained fully recovered at follow-up. One-third of those with an eating disorder and one-half of those in partial recovery at baseline attained full recovery at follow-up. Discussion: These findings support the current operationalization of eating disorder recovery, encompassing physical, behavioral, and cognitive indices, as valid and highlight that full recovery is not only possible but predicts full recovery years later. Future research should examine this operationalization in diverse samples and study trajectories of recovery to identify predictors. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In an earlier paper we described a structured, theory-driven training programme which was administered to 10 individuals with moderate-to-severe memory impairment. All individuals received an errorless-fading-of-cues protocol in the use of personal digital assistants (PDAs) or smartphones (Svoboda, Richards, Leach, & Mertens, 2012) and demonstrated generalisation of acquired skills to day-to-day memory challenges. Maintenance of intervention gains over the long-term is another indicator of successful generalisation. Here we present the maintenance of device use in the same group of individuals 12 to 19 months after programme completion. A within-subject, ABABB multi-case experimental design was used to evaluate the impact of PDA or smartphone use on day-to-day memory functioning at baseline, immediately post-intervention, at return to baseline, and at short-term and long-term follow-up. Results presented here focus predominantly on long-term follow-up. All 10 individuals showed maintenance of gains in day-to-day functioning as quantified across several ecologically valid questionnaire and task-based measures. This was corroborated by family members with whom six of the participants resided. This study further demonstrates the programme's clinical effectiveness in enabling individuals with moderate-to-severe memory impairment to function more independently and with greater confidence up to 19 months following programme completion.

AB  - Internet surveys are cost-effective and convenient, but give respondents the opportunity to search the Web for answers to factual questions. Surprisingly, few have investigated the quality of political knowledge data collected in crowd-sourced Internet samples. Using a novel technique to identify individual "cheaters" across six data sets-collected on Amazon's Mechanical Turk (professionalized paid "workers") and SurveyMonkey (less-professionalized unpaid "audiences")-we find that cheating is pervasive. In addition to detecting "cheaters," we also show that their political knowledge is significantly inflated compared with non-cheaters, posing problems for the accurate measurement of knowledge. Fortunately, we also demonstrate that question-wording alterations can significantly improve data quality and show that cheating is less-common on mobile survey-taking platforms (compared with desktop/laptop computers).

AB  - Political knowledge can affect measures obtained in public opinion research and political science. When asked political knowledge questions, some respondents look up the answers online, inflating political knowledge scores. This response behavior is detectable in web surveys using paradata. This study investigates whether and to what extent respondents switch away from the survey to search for answers online using JavaScript OnBlur functions. Respondents were randomly assigned to device types (PC or smartphone) and response formats (open or closed) and answered a self-report question. The results reveal that about 30 percent of the respondents look up answers, depending on the device type and response format. They also reveal that switching away and correct answers are significantly associated with the response format. These findings provide new insights on looking up answers online and show that paradata are a promising new method to detect response behavior that may lead to incorrect inferences about respondents' political knowledge. The findings also show that paradata and self-reports complement each other and that both measures should be combined in future web surveys measuring political knowledge. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Although Mobile Data Services (MDS) are expected to revolutionise internet use, they have yet to do so, in part, because many users are not continuing with MDS after initial use. This study examines which factors are most important in converting discontinuers into continuers, and whether they differ from those that are effective in maintaining continuers. We conducted an online survey to compare continuers and discontinuers empirically in terms of the relative importance of seven post-adoption factors to the behavioural intention to use MDS. The results show that usefulness and social influence were more important for discontinuers, ubiquitous connectivity for continuers. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The 16th China National Reading Survey conducted by Chinese Academy of Press and Publication indicates that in 2018, the trend of reading was characterized by the use of mobile digital devices among Chinese readers. Digital reading continued to maintain its momentum and pushed up the overall percentage of readers in the Chinese population. However, it also contributed to slower growth in the reading of printed materials. Adult Chinese spent the longest time reading on their mobile phones among all kinds of media, while among all traditional printed media, they spent the longest time reading books. In addition, audio reading continued to grow, with mobile audio apps being the main platform for audio books listening. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - With nearly 50% of U.S. mobile phone subscribers using smartphones, survey researchers are beginning to explore their use as a data collection tool. The Got Healthy Apps Study (GHAS) conducted a randomized experiment to compare mode effects for a survey completed via iPhone mobile browser and online via desktop/laptop computer web browser. Mode effects were assessed for three types of outcomes: randomization/recruitment, survey process/completion, and survey items. In short, the distribution of survey completion times and the distribution of the number of apps owned were significantly different across survey mode after accounting for block group. Other key mode effects outcomes (including open-ended items, slider bar questions, and missing item rates) showed no significant differences across survey mode. Some interesting qualitative findings suggest that iPhone respondents enter more characters and omit fewer items than originally thought. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Mobile learning technologies and wireless networks are being increasingly used in educational settings. Mobile learning (M-learning) through wireless technology can deliver information access to anyone any time in any place. A study was conducted to investigate the readiness of Mathematics students in Brunel University to move towards using Mobile Learning in their studies, and also to explore the factors that might affect the implementation of this technology. A total number of 82 students participated in an online questionnaire in May 2011. The questionnaire was designed in order to determine the availability of the appropriate devices, students’ perceptions about M-learning and their expectations of mobile learning services. The findings of the study show that students have a positive perspective of using M-learning and they look at it as a support system for traditional class-based learning.

AB  - Little is known about the reliability and validity in web surveys, although this is crucial information to evaluate how accurate the results might be and/or to correct for measurement errors. In particular, there are few studies based on probability-based samples for web surveys, looking at web-specific response scales and considering the impact of having smartphone respondents. In this article, we start filling these gaps by estimating the measurement quality of sliders compared to radio button scales controlling for the device respondents used. We conducted therefore two multitrait–multimethod (MTMM) experiments in the Norwegian Citizen Panel (NCP), a probability-based online panel. Overall, we find that if smartphone respondents represent a nonnegligible part of the whole sample, offering the response options in form of a slider or a radio button scale leads to a quite similar measurement quality. This means that sliders could be used more often without harming the data quality. Besides, if there are no smartphone respondents, we find that sliders can also be used, but that the marker should be placed initially in the middle rather than on the left side. However, in practice, there is no need to shift from radio buttons to sliders since the quality is not highly improved by providing sliders.

AB  - Objectives: Previous research suggests that anticipation of incoming phone calls or messages and impulsivity are significantly associated with motor vehicle crash. We took a more explanative approach to investigate a conceptual model regarding the direct and indirect effect of compulsive cell phone use and impulsive personality traits on crash risk. Methods: We recruited a sample of 307 undergraduate college students to complete an online survey that included measures of cell phone use, impulsivity, and history of motor vehicle crash. Using a structural equation model, we examined the direct and indirect relationships between factors of the Cell Phone Overuse Scale-II (CPOS-II), impulsivity, in-vehicle phone use, and severity and frequency of previous motor vehicle crash. Self-reported miles driven per week and year in college were included as covariates in the model. Results: Our findings suggest that anticipation of incoming communication has a direct association with greater in-vehicle phone use, but was not directly or indirectly associated with increasing risk of previous motor vehicle crash. Of the three latent factors comprising the CPOS-II, only anticipation was significantly associated with elevated cell phone use while driving. Greater impulsivity and use of in-vehicle cell phone use while driving were directly and significantly associated with greater risk of motor vehicle crash. Conclusions: Anticipation of incoming cellular contacts (calls or texts) is associated with greater in-vehicle phone use, while greater in-vehicle cell phone use and impulsive traits are associated with elevated risk of motor vehicle crashes.

AB  - How should we measure broadband adoption by individuals and communities, given different modes of access, including home broadband, smartphone use, and public access? We measure online activities and indicators of skill to understand opportunities for digital citizenship, or participation in society online. Based on a 2011 survey in Chicago, we find more mobile phone adoption among Blacks than among non-Hispanic Whites, and greater likelihood of Internet use for job searches among residents who rely primarily on smartphones to go online than among home broadband adopters. Yet our analysis also shows that broadband at home remains critically important for digital citizenship, and that the growth in mobile phone use has not erased inequalities in participation online and seems unlikely to do so. Moreover, smartphones are not bridging the gap in disadvantaged communities. Multilevel statistical models show inequality in both Internet access and economic and political activities across geographic areas, or communities. Technology disparities that are patterned by place have implications for opportunity and equity at the neighborhood level. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - After ECN was first added to IP in 2001, it was hit by a succession of deployment problems. Studies in recent years have concluded that path traversal of ECN has become close to universal. In this article, we test whether the performance enhancement called ECN++ will face a similar deployment struggle as did base ECN. For this, we assess the feasibility of ECN++ deployment over mobile as well as fixed networks. In the process, we discover bad news for the base ECN protocol: contrary to accepted beliefs, more than half the mobile carriers we tested wipe the ECN field at the first upstream hop. All packets still get through, and congestion control still functions, just without the benefits of ECN. This throws into question whether previous studies used representative vantage points. This article also reports the good news that, wherever ECN gets through, we found no deployment problems for the "++" enhancement to ECN. The article includes the results of other in-depth tests that check whether servers that claim to support ECN actually respond correctly to explicit congestion feedback. Those interested can access the raw measurement data online. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Growth of digital, social, and mobile media has enabled engagement with multiple media activities during news consumption in a more efficient and synchronous fashion than before. This study investigates whether media multitasking activities while consuming political news affects individuals' levels of subjective and factual political knowledge. Results from a Web survey of online panel members show that on the whole, pairwise and bundled forms of media multitasking are negatively related to factual political knowledge. Also, those who engage in media multitasking are more likely to report that they are politically knowledgeable but they do not know about politics as much as they think they do. Implications are discussed for media multitasking and an informed citizenry. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - During the last decades, an important shift in media use is that people increasingly follow the news by using digital and portable media, while news consumption via traditional, offline media is decreasing. A key question is how this change influences the extent to which people seek out and learn about politics from the news media. Using a large twowave panel survey (N = 2,828) with detailed measures of political learning and consumption of the same news outlets on different media platforms, the study shows that while political interest has a positive impact on news consumption across all platforms, people mainly learn about current political affairs from using traditional, offline platforms. In contrast, there are no general learning effects from using news media on computers and mobile devices. The study thereby demonstrates how the increasing importance of newer, digital media platforms for news consumption challenges the ideal of a broadly informed citizenry. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This article analyses how changing life situations affect media use, conceptualized as a question of how biographical disruption could destabilize media repertoires and public connection. To answer this question, the analysis draws on qualitative data from a comprehensive study of media use in Norway, with in-depth interviews and media diaries. The theoretical approach joins domestication and media repertoire theory with research on public connection, considering the ubiquity of digital media in contemporary society. Findings indicate that smartphone use is key to people’s reorientations in periods of change, and that intimate and emotional responses to mobile media warrant closer attention. The article contributes to debates on the transformation of media repertoires, a question of growing concern within research on cross-media use, and to long-standing interests in the role of media in everyday life and as central to public connection.

AB  - In today's world of networked, mobile, and global digital communication, Muslim martyrdom as a multi-layered communicative practice has experienced a new type of media saturation, thereby posing a challenge for the study of media, religion, and culture in a digital age. In this article, the analysis focuses on two cases of high symbolic relevance for the events later referred to as the "Arab Spring"--the deaths of a Tunisian fruit seller Mohammed Bouazizi and a young Egyptian man Khaled Saeed. Special focus is given to the discussion of digital solidarities and their construction in circulation and remediation of martyr narratives of Bouazizi and Saeed in diverse media contexts. In this global development of digital solidarities, we identify two categories of martyr images of particular relevance--a "living martyr" and a "tortured martyr"--and discuss their resonance with different historical, religious, cultural, and political frames of interpretation. In conclusion, we reflect on the question of the ethics of global mediation of Muslim martyrdom and its implications for the study field of media, religion, and culture in its digital state.

AB  - This article highlights the necessity of considering socio-cultural values and attitudes when designing digital media, through presenting a study that explores parental attitudes toward play and digital media in childhood. Here we present a study examining the effectiveness of a mobile application designed to encourage real-world play between parents and their children (aged three to five years old). A series of quasi-naturalistic play spaces were created in child-centric organisations with parents visiting these organisations invited to use the play space—including tablet devices loaded with the application. Surveys—including open and closed questions—were collected from 28 parents along with observational data focusing on parent–child–screen interactions. The research highlights a tension between the physicality and preconceptions of digital devices and parent–child play. We also note the mobilisation of the notion ‘quality time’ as somewhat antithetical to digital play—indeed, expectations of digital devices in childhood, alongside a presumed developmental purpose of certain forms of play, impacted the capacity of this application to facilitate real-world play. These findings and resulting methodological discussion have implications for both the design of mobile applications and future research. Moreover, this article highlights some of the values and assumptions that influence parental expectations of purposing play and digital media.

AB  - The current article discusses, the papers which were featured in the second issue of Mass Communication and Society. The articles focus on the 2012 London Olympic Games as an unparalleled global media spectacle. One article used survey research to examine Olympics-related media use during the Games, finding strong relationships between traditional (television) consumption and consumption via mobile devices and the web. The other two articles relied on analyses of media content to examine digital and traditional coverage of the Games. The final article compared 2012 newspaper coverage of the Games to the coverage surrounding the 2008 Beijing Olympics, assessing the presentation of athletes in relationship to national identity. One additional Olympic article is featured that was not submitted for the special issue but had been accepted through the general review process. The article concludes with thanks to the panel of reviewers for this special issue. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Today's technologies are thought to scatter our minds. Critics are warning against the onslaught of the digital on the material, especially when it comes to reading. Of course we must draw a distinction between the broad metaphoric idea of a bookshelf as embodying the contents of the mind, and the bookshelf as a purely practical, material tool for storing information, but nonetheless we should question what these new technologies are doing to our identities. The starting point should be the assumption that, despite the idea that the virtual world sees the denaturalization of experience, the digital world is not built on the ephemerality of the invisible, but on a profound groundedness in materiality, of human bodies providing material labor by stuffing broadband cables into the ground, or extracting metals from the ground to produce computers and mobile phones. One only needs to have a look at a few recent developments to understand the nature of this new materiality of the digital age. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In this paper, the authors suggest the merger of the Massively Open Online Course (MOOC) format and mobile learning (mLearning) based on mutual affordances of both contemporary learning/teaching formats to investigate learner interactions and dialogues in an open online course. The paper presents a case study of how MobiMOOC, a course created using the MOOC format, demonstrates the synergistic characteristics between the MOOC format and mLearning, making a combination of both fields ideal for contemporary, digital, collaborative learning, and knowledge construction based on learner interactions and dialogue. MobiMOOC was a six-week online course focusing on mLearning that ran in April and May 2011. An end-of-course survey provides insight that supports the synergies between MOOCs and mLearning: collaboration, informal and lifelong learning, and dialogue.

AB  - Some studies about processing metaphors, which are accepted to be a natural product of the human cognitive system, focus on the processing where some focus on online processing of metaphors. Online studies where behavioral reactions are measured during silent reading are based on various methods such as self-paced reading, eye-movement and brain imaging techniques. This research will handle processing of prototypical and peripheral concepts and metaphors with varying degrees of familiarity during silent reading. This research aims to test behavioral reactions to prototypical and peripheral concepts and familiar and unfamiliar metaphors during silent reading. In this frame, behavioral reactions during silent reading in Turkish are measured by eye-movement method trying to answer how (a) prototypical concepts are processed, (b) peripheral concepts are processed, (c) metaphors with a high degree of familiarity are processed, (d) metaphors with a low degree of familiarity are processed. To answer these questions two pilot experiments and one main experiment has been carried out with separate subjects. In the research, where the findings of behavioral experiments which are applied as preparation to the main experiment with SMI RED 500 Hz eye-movement device are discussed as well, it is found that peripheral concepts are processed in a longer time compared to prototypical concepts, and metaphors with a low level of familiarity are processed in a longer time compared to metaphors with a high degree of familiarity.

AB  - İnsanın bilişsel sisteminin doğal bir ürünü olduğu kabul edilen metaforların işlemlenmesine ilişkin çalışmaların bir kısmı, süreç-dışı yöntemlerle, bir kısmı da süreç-içi yöntemlerle metaforların nasıl işlemlendiğine odaklanmaktadır. Sessiz okuma sırasında davranışsal tepkilerin ölçüldüğü süreç-içi araştırmalar, kendi hızında okuma, göz izleme, beyin görüntüleme gibi farklı yöntemleri temel almaktadır. Bu araştırmada, sessiz okuma sırasında öntürsel ve öntürden uzak kavramlarla, farklı bilinirlik düzeylerindeki metaforların işlemlenmesi ele alınacaktır. Araştırmada, sessiz okuma sırasında öntürsel ve öntürden uzak kavramlara ve bilinirlik düzeyi yüksek olan ve olmayan metaforlara yönelik davranışsal tepkilerin sınanması amaçlanmaktadır. Bu çerçevede araştırmada, Türkçede sessiz okuma sırasında (a) öntürü temsil eden kavramların işlemlenmesi, (b) öntürden uzak kavramların işlemlenmesi, (c) bilinirlik düzeyi yüksek olan metaforların işlemlenmesi, (d) bilinirlik düzeyi düşük olan metaforların işlemlenmesi süreçlerinde göz izleme yöntemiyle ölçülen davranışsal tepkilerin neler olduğu sorularına yanıt aranmıştır. Araştırmada farklı katılımcılardan oluşan toplam üç deney gerçekleştirilmiştir. SMI RED 500 Hz göz izleme sistemiyle uygulanan deneylere hazırlayıcı olması amacıyla uygulanan davranışsal deneylerin de bulgularının tartışıldığı bu araştırmada, öntürden uzak kavramların öntürü temsil eden kavramlardan, bilinirlik düzeyi düşük olan metaforların bilinirlik düzeyi yüksek olan metaforlardan daha uzun sürede işlemlendiği sonucuna ulaşılmıştır.

AB  - Media significantly shape how and what we learn. To date there is limited understanding of digital media and information use by engineering students. We comprehensively review existing literature and present findings from a research study investigating digital media and information use of ‘millennial’ engineers who purportedly possess distinctive experience, habits, and perceptions about technology. We administered a multiple-item survey to a cohort of first year engineering students who entered a large public university in the United States in August 2009. Self-reported information on the frequency of media device usage, participation in social networking, academic activities and information seeking tendencies, was received from 204 participants. Similar to other youth, millennial engineers use technology extensively and are frequent users of both commonly used digital devices as well as applications. Students’ device ownership was marked by a relatively low use of desktop computers and significant use of mobile devices. Students reported using the Internet extensively for both entertainment and school related work. Facebook™ use was common but Twitter™ use was limited. Multitasking was common and its self-reported effectiveness varied across participants. Gender differences were found across several items. Implications for teaching and learning are discussed.

AB  - The ‘Mind-Upload’ hypothesis (MU), a radical version of the Brain-in-a-Vat thought experiment, asserts that a whole mind can safely be transferred from a brain to a digital device, after being exactly encoded into substrate independent informational patterns. Prima facie, MU seems the philosophical archenemy of the Embodied Mind theory (EM), which understands embodiment as a necessary and constitutive condition for the existence of a mind and its functions. In truth, whether and why MU and EM are ultimately incompatible is unobvious. This paper, which aims to answer both questions, will not simply confirm that MU and EM actually are incompatible. It will also show the true reason of their incompatibility: while EM implies that a mind’s individual identity is contingent upon the details of its physical constituents, MU presupposes that minds can be relocated from one material vessel to another. A systematic comparison between these conflicting assumptions reveals that the real shortcoming of MU is not the one usually discussed by the philosophical literature: it has nothing to do with MU’s functionalist or computationalist prerequisites, and is only secondarily related to the artificial implementability of consciousness; the real problem is that MU presupposes that minds could still be individuated and numerically identified while being reduced to immaterial formal patterns. EM seems committed to refute this assumption, but does it have sufficient resources to succeed? (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Da die mobile Technologie es den Nutzern ermöglicht, überall und zu jeder Zeit online zu sein, berichten immer mehr Nutzer, dass sie sich ständig wachsam fühlen und mit den Online-Streams von Online-Informationen und -Kommunikation beschäftigt sind - ein Phänomen, das seit kurzem als Online-Vigilanz bezeichnet wird. Trotz der zunehmenden Verbreitung sind die Folgen dieser ständigen Ausrichtung auf Online-Informations- und Kommunikationsströme für das Wohlbefinden der Nutzer weitgehend unklar. In der vorliegenden Studie haben wir untersucht, ob ständige Wachsamkeit mit kognitiven Folgen in Form von erhöhtem Gedankenwandern und verminderter Achtsamkeit zusammenhängt und die daraus resultierenden Auswirkungen auf das Wohlbefinden untersucht. Um unsere Annahmen zu testen, haben wir ein Wegmodell auf Basis von Umfragedaten (N = 371) geschätzt. Das Modell unterstützte die Mehrheit unserer vorregistrierten Hypothesen: Online-Vigilanz war in der Tat mit Gedankenwandern und Achtsamkeit verbunden, aber nur Achtsamkeit vermittelte die Beziehung zu vermindertem Wohlbefinden. So waren diejenigen, die sich mental mit Online-Kommunikation beschäftigen, insgesamt weniger zufrieden mit ihrem Leben und berichteten von weniger affektivem Wohlbefinden, wenn sie auch eine reduzierte Achtsamkeit erlebten.

AB  - As mobile technology allows users to be online anywhere and at all times, a growing number of users report feeling constantly alert and preoccupied with online streams of online information and communication - a phenomenon that has recently been termed online vigilance. Despite its growing prevalence, consequences of this constant orientation toward online streams of information and communication for users' well-being are largely unclear. In the present study, we investigated whether being constantly vigilant is related to cognitive consequences in the form of increased mind-wandering and decreased mindfulness and examined the resulting implications for well-being. To test our assumptions, we estimated a path model based on survey data (N = 371). The model supported the majority of our preregistered hypotheses: online vigilance was indeed related to mind-wandering and mindfulness, but only mindfulness mediated the relationship with decreased well-being. Thus, those mentally preoccupied with online communication were overall less satisfied with their lives and reported less affective well-being when they also experienced reduced mindfulness.

AB  - One overall aim of this chapter is to identify the prevalence rates of mixed devices (especially smartphones and tablets) in a representative online panel survey in Germany between 2014 and 2016. Moreover, demographic and psychographic determinants of device type usage for online survey participation across time are identified, along with selected consequences of device usage on nonresponse indicators, survey duration, and evaluative judgments regarding the respective surveys. We found that a substantial share of online survey participants do actually use mobile devices, and that nonresponse is most pronounced among smartphone users. We also found that smartphone users perceive surveys as longer and evaluate them less favorable compared to PC/Laptop participants. The presence of others is another characteristic associated with mobile device survey participants, representing a potential source of bias for collecting data on topics sensitive to social influences. The collection of findings presented in this chapter converges against the claim to systematically align the communication strategy, the survey-fielding process, and the incentive scheme with the devices used for survey participation.

AB  - This paper provides an overview of the e-book publishing industry in China and its changing business models. As the conventional publishing industry has continued to contract, digitization is becoming increasingly popular. Although China is an influential developing country undergoing rapid change, a dearth of research on its digital publishing industry exists at the present time. This article therefore explores two main research questions: (1) What are the recent trends and business models of digital publishing in China? (2) How might we evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of such business models? To this end, multiple case studies are employed, as is the paradigm of structure-conduct-performance (SCP). It is proposed that Content plus App and Content plus Device are the basic business models for Chinese digital content producers and distributors. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In this article, we present a study on the data quality and the response process of mobile online surveys using an experimental design as compared to a standard computer. We used the following indicators to measure data quality and response properties: reaction time to survey invitation, break-off rate, item nonresponse, length of responses to open-ended questions and survey transmission, processing, and completion time. With regard to completion time, we also explored the significance of the place as well as the situation in which the survey was completed, the kind of Internet connection the respondents had as well as the hardware properties of the devices used to answer the online survey. Our results suggest comparable data quality and response properties in most aspects: There were no noticeable differences between computer and mobile users as regards break-off rate, item nonresponse, and length of responses to open-ended questions, nor the place where the survey was completed. However, it took respondents in the mobile group longer to complete the survey as compared to respondents answering the online survey on their computer. In terms of the completion time, there was a significant decrease in the differences between mobile devices and PCs when respondents used technically advanced mobile devices and had access to a fast Internet connection.

AB  - This article investigates the usage of mobile digital-calendar solutions in a knowledge work setting through the means of an empirical survey (n = 220) among managers and experts in a global telecommunications company. It is indicated, that the mobile digital calendars are not only perceived especially value adding in a highly mobile work context and when using a central company calendar is mandated, but also in other user groups overall satisfaction with this type of calendar tool seems high. Mobile digital calendars seem to answer the needs of a highly mobile and temporally pressured user group. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Multilingual classrooms in developing countries are often challenged by a lack of digital resources and technology which supports their multilingual learning process. Code-switching is a phenomenon common to multilingual schools where learners are taught in a language which is not their first language. In these environments, code-switchers frequently alternate between their first and second languages, seeking alternative words to clarify their understanding of the topic being studied. This paper presents a study based in South Africa, where mathematics learners interacted with a mobile learning system named M-Thuto, supporting learners who code-switch while learning and providing them with digital resources. The system consisted of summarised notes, class exercises and a class quiz. Through semi-structured interviews and questionnaires, data were gathered and analysed from 90 learners to gain perspectives on their interaction processes. The study aimed to establish how mobile learning can be used to support multilingual learners in under-resourced schools. The results of the study reflect the need for mobile learning resources that support their learning considering their linguistic challenges. The results also reflect the important role that mobile phones can play as alternative digital learning resources. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Mobile food ordering apps (MFOAs) have been widely considered in the restaurant sector as innovative channels to reach customers and provide them with high-quality services. However, there are important questions regarding the impact of implementing MFOAs on customer satisfaction and on customers’ intention to reuse such apps. Several studies have examined the outcomes of using MFOAs from the customer’s perspective. The fundamental purpose of this study is to identify and empirically examine the main factors predicting the e-satisfaction with MFOAs and customers’ intention to reuse such apps in Jordan. This research proposes an integrated model based on the extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) and the features of MFOAs: online review, online rating, and online tracking. The data was collected from a convenience sample of Jordanian customers who have used MFOAs. The main results are based on structural equation modelling and support the role of online review, online rating, online tracking, performance expectancy, hedonic motivation, and price value on e-satisfaction and continued intention to reuse. This study provides a theoretical contribution and presents practical implications relevant to academics and practitioners working in areas related to MFOAs.

AB  - Background and aims: Gaming applications have become one of the main entertainment features on smartphones, and this could be potentially problematic in terms of dangerous, prohibited, and dependent use among a minority of individuals. A cross-national study was conducted in Belgium and Finland. The aim was to examine the relationship between gaming on smartphones and self-perceived problematic smartphone use via an online survey to ascertain potential predictors. Methods: The Short Version of the Problematic Mobile Phone Use Questionnaire (PMPUQ-SV) was administered to a sample comprising 899 participants (30% male; age range: 18–67 years). Results: Good validity and adequate reliability were confirmed regarding the PMPUQ-SV, especially the dependence subscale, but low prevalence rates were reported in both countries using the scale. Regression analysis showed that downloading, using Facebook, and being stressed contributed to problematic smartphone use. Anxiety emerged as predictor for dependence. Mobile games were used by one-third of the respective populations, but their use did not predict problematic smartphone use. Very few cross-cultural differences were found in relation to gaming through smartphones. Conclusion: Findings suggest mobile gaming does not appear to be problematic in Belgium and Finland.

AB  - Contemporary children live in the digital environment and develop very quickly the natural ability in using technologies. At an international level, scientific research confirms the widespread use of mobile devices in the family and the increasing children exposure to these. This study mainly focuses on the following aspects: the benefits of touch devices for games and creativity and the risks related to possible delays in social and linguistic development and to addictions. In Italy, statistical surveys reveal a contradictory scenario: on the one hand, the digitization of citizens complies with international trends, especially regarding the use of the smartphone; on the other hand, there is a strong technological backwardness in the institutional area. The survey has analyzed the relationship between digitods and touch media, paying attention to usage profiles, usage behaviors, interaction, app selection and fruition processes. It has also been observed the parent-child interaction during the use of touch media, in order to figure out media educational guidelines in kindergarten.

AB  - This study, derived from a differential gains model, examines how mobile-based political information seeking is associated with offline and online political participation in interaction with three political discussion features: frequency, size, and heterogeneity. Data from a Web survey of an online panel indicate that the link between mobile information seeking and offline and online political participation is greater for respondents who discuss politics with others face to face and online more frequently and a greater diversity of others face to face and online.

AB  - This study explores how mobile instant messaging use, affordances, and social capital may directly and indirectly influence positive employee outcomes. A field survey of 245 Hong Kong real estate agents showed that their mobile instant messaging (MIM) use and affordances were positively associated with job performance, job satisfaction, and relational satisfaction, and with online bridging and bonding social capital. While bridging capital was not associated with any of the three outcomes, bonding social capital was positively related to the two satisfaction measures. However (with one small exception), neither type of social capital mediated relationships between MIM use and affordances, and employee outcomes.

AB  - Mobile journalism is one of the fastest areas of growth in the modern journalism industry. Yet mobile journalists find themselves in a place of tension, between print, broadcast, and digital journalism and between traditional journalism and lifestyle journalism. Using the lens of field theory, the present study conducted an online survey of mobile journalists (N = 39) from six countries representing four continents on how they conceive of their journalistic role, and how their work is perceived within the newsroom. Participants were journalists in television, print, magazine, and digital local and national newsrooms. The present study sought to understand how mobile journalists see mobile production as a part of their journalistic role, and what field theory dimensions influence mobile production in their newsrooms. While prior research has established a growing prevalence of lifestyle journalism, the present study finds that the growth of mobile journalism represents the development of lifestyle journalism norms, such as content driven by the audience, within even traditional journalism.

AB  - This study investigates online resource theory by focusing on mobile communication's role in political engagement. The effects of mobile media use on online political engagement are explored through a random-sample survey of how citizens used mobile devices during the 2012 US presidential election. Controls for demographics, political interest, and ideological strength provide context for understanding individual-level differences. Younger, better educated respondents who were more likely to be politically interested and self-described as possessing stronger political ideologies were more likely to engage with the election campaign through their mobile phones. Users' mobile media activity breadth produced the strongest positive association with online political engagement. Also, the interactive association of political interest and mobile media activity breadth reinforced political interest's influence on engagement. Findings support and extend literature on the positive but complicated role of mobile and digital technology in the deployment of online resources for political engagement. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - As the digital generations have grown up with high-tech gadgets and become avid users of mobile phones and apps, they are also exposed to increasing mobile security threats and vulnerability. In this paper the authors discuss the impact of recent mobile technology advancements on mobile threat environment and mobile security practices. They also conducted a survey to 262 college students to examine their mobile phone usage patterns, security concerns and practices. The results show that students use their mobile phone frequently for various productivity and entertainment purposes. They are generally aware of and concerned about mobile security, not only on losing the phone physically but also on data theft, web threat, and mobile malware. Students also practice security to some extend - most change PIN and passwords regularly, download their apps mostly from official app stores, and generally keep their OS and apps up-to-date. The authors also found significant correlations between mobile security practices and personal attributes, including major, gender, and technology aptitude.

AB  - Psychological factors and social relationships are important components that influence an individual’s communication style. This paper aims to examine the association of personality factors, social anxiety (SA) and loneliness with mobile phone (MP) usage preferences on the basis of voice calling and text messaging. Malaysian MP users (N = 187) completed four questionnaires (Mobile Phone Usage Questionnaire, Big Five Inventory, Interaction Anxiousness Scale and UCLA Loneliness Scale) on paper or online via a web-link. Multiple regression analyses revealed that personality, SA and loneliness broadly predicted preferences for voice calling or text messaging. Further analyses examining the predictability of time spent on voice calls/text messaging and number of people called/exchanged text messages also revealed some significant findings in regards to the openness-to-experience personality dimension, loneliness and SA. The findings of this research have important implications to tailoring the delivery of psychological services to individuals diagnosed with chronic loneliness and SA.

AB  - This research was previously published in the Handbook of Research on Media Literacy in the Digital Age edited by Melda N. Yildiz and Jared Keengwe, pages 436-455, copyright year 2016 by Information Science Reference (an imprint of IGI Global). A questionnaire survey was conducted with university students from a women’s university in Japan on the use of mobile phones during a lecture. Topics specifically investigated included (1) whether students put their mobile phone on their desk during the lecture, (2) the reasons why students put their phone on their desk during the lecture, (3) responses to incoming calls during the lecture, and (4) the psychological impact on students of setting rules regarding the use of mobile phones during the lecture. Students were divided into two groups according to their responses to item (1): those who said they put their phone on their desk and those who said they did not do so. These groups were compared in terms of items (3) and (4). As a result, it was found that over 60% of students put their mobile phone on their desk during the lecture and that these students were more likely to use their mobile phone during the lecture. The survey suggested that students today are aware of mobile phone etiquette with respect to lectures, and are especially aware that communication etiquette conflicts with lecture etiquette.

AB  - This study examined the use of mobile phones to regulate negative emotions, considering both the role of different aspects of phone use and individual differences in emotion regulation strategies. A total of 287 young adult smartphone users completed an online survey that addressed use of mobile phones for negative emotion regulation. They responded to a phone loss scenario by rating how much they would miss various uses/functions of the phone (which could be involved in emotion regulation). Habitual use of reappraisal to regulate emotion was associated with missing both interpersonal contact and social support, but not access to entertainment/information. In contrast, habitual use of emotion suppression was associated only with missing entertainment/information content. Regulating negative emotions via mobile phone was associated with missing all three uses/functions of the phone, but perception that the phone was effective in remediating negative emotion was associated only with missing social support. Well-being was related to greater use and perceived effectiveness of the mobile phone for emotion regulation. Overall, this study demonstrates that mobile phones can yield psychological benefits, depending on how they are used. Findings suggest that using the phone for social support is most likely to lead to effective remediation of negative emotion. Interpretations and implications of the findings are discussed.

AB  - This article reports on an action-research project designed to investigate the effect of a technological intervention on the complex interactions between student engagement, participation, attendance and preparation in a large lecture delivered as part of a compulsory first-year law course, a discipline which has not been the focus of any previous study. The technology used was VotApedia, a form of mobile phone voting, and it was implemented in tandem with constructivist pedagogies such as explicit pre-reading and a prior context of interactive lecturing. Data were collected through observation, via mobile phone voting in class and by an online survey designed to specifically explore the relationship between attendance at VotApedia lectures and factors such as self-reported engagement, attendance and preparation. The findings indicated that student response systems (SRSs) are just as applicable to more Humanities-style disciplines which require divergent questioning, and supported complex interactions between engagement, attendance and preparation. Preliminary findings indicated that, although more work needs to be done, especially on the types of students who prefer to use these systems, there is a clear potential to increase student engagement in large law lectures through the use of SRSs.

AB  - The number of mobile phone subscriptions worldwide reached almost 7 billion in 2013. Therefore, the social and psychological consequences of the technology are of great interest to new media scholars and policy makers. Adopting an affordance-based approach, this study examines how different uses of the mobile phone are related to individuals’ subjective well-being and social capital. Findings from a national survey showed that both voice and online communication with the mobile phone is positively related to various indicators of subjective well-being and bonding and bridging capital. Moreover, both bonding and bridging capital mediated the relationship between mobile phone use and subjective well-being. On the other hand, non-communicative uses, such as information seeking activities, were negatively related to positive affect and passing time activities were positively related to negative affect. Implications of the findings are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This article investigates unintended mobile access to surveys in online, probability-based panels. We find that spontaneous tablet usage is drastically increasing in web surveys, while smartphone usage remains low. Further, we analyze the bias of respondent profiles using smartphones and tablets compared to those using computers, on the basis of several sociodemographic characteristics. Our results indicate not only that mobile web respondents differ from PC users but also that tablet users differ from smartphone users. While tablets are used for survey completion by working (young) adults, smartphones are used merely by the young. In addition, our results indicate that mobile web respondents are more progressive and describe themselves more often as pioneers or forerunners in adopting new technology, compared to PC respondents. We further discover that respondents’ preferences for devices to complete surveys are clearly in line with unintended mobile response. Finally, we present a similar analysis on intended mobile response in an experiment where smartphone users were requested to complete a mobile survey. Based on these findings, testing on tablets is strongly recommended in online surveys. If the goal is to reach young respondents, enabling surveys via smartphones should be considered.

AB  - More and more older people are using smartphones or tablet computers; for many it is a viable substitute for a normal mobile phone, or even an entry into the new digital age. With mobile devices, older people can use mobile Internet at home or on the move. Smartphones and tablets allow mobile access to information and communication, so it provides a mobile guide for older adults in their daily lives. But what is the level of acceptance and use of mobile Internet in the older population, and what factors influence the use of these devices? This paper examined older Swiss peoples' acceptance of and attitudes toward the use of smartpnones and tablet computers, as well as mobile Internet. A representative study was conducted: a Swiss survey of 1,037 people aged 65 and older. 56% of the older people interviewed used the Internet in the autumn of 2014. 32% of the interviewed owned a smartphone and 26% a tablet computer. Between the age groups and the sociodemographic groups a divide by the mobile devices was found. 34% of Internet users also use mobile Internet. The data showed that, beside lower age, technological affinity and general attitude towards the Internet are positively associated with the use of mobile Intemet. The research also showed that many mobile Internet users describe the use of their smartphone as a resource for coping with daily living. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This paper describes the contemporary use of information technology devices by children in a socio-educationally advantaged school. A sample of 924 children (50% girls) from grades 5 to 12 (ages 10–19 years) completed an online survey in class. Total daily technology use was high and similar for girls (mean 219 (SD 148) mins/day) and boys (207 (142), p = .186). Tablet computer was the dominant device used in grades 5–9, with laptop computer the dominant device in grades 10–12. Patterns of exposure were influenced by gender, device, grade and purpose of use interactions. For example, girls used mobile phones more than boys for social purposes for grades 10 and 11, but not grade 12. Whilst children’s attitudes to technology use were positive, musculoskeletal and visual symptoms were commonly reported. Hours/day tablet and phone use was related to neck/shoulder discomfort (OR = 1.07; 1.13) and visual symptoms (OR = 1.10; 1.07). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In an era of digitally connected students, there is a demand for academic material to be delivered through electronic mobile devices and not just through traditional methods such as lectures and tutorials. A digital interactive book—iBook (for use on the Apple iPad)—was created to teach undergraduate anatomical science students (n = 26) four key areas of the brachial plexus: definitions, gross anatomy, relative anatomy, and functions of terminal branches. Students were asked to complete preresource and postresource questionnaires, which were used to calculate the mean improvement score and ultimately the efficacy of the resource. Free text comments were gathered to evaluate student opinions on this mode of learning. The mean score on the preresource and postresource questionnaires was 4.07 of 8 and 5.69 of 8, respectively. The overall mean improvement score was 1.62, determined statistically significant by a dependent t‐test (P = 0.0004). Findings demonstrate that digital books on the iPad provide a uniquely interactive way of delivering information and engaging students. Furthermore, digital books can be used alongside traditional methods of teaching anatomy to enhance and promote deep learning in students. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Whether mobile phones benefit or sabotage close relationships has been a persistent subject of debate in media and communication studies. Because previous studies have demonstrated contrasting findings, further studies on this topic are required. Based on media richness theory and social penetration theory, this study investigated the direct and indirect associations between mobile communication and relationship quality (i.e., depth, support, and conflict) in romantic relationships. A survey of 1,000 university students in China revealed that relationship depth was positively predicted by mobile phone calls and negatively predicted by mobile short messages. Mobile WeChat had dialectical effects, as it reinforced relationship depth and support, but increased conflict. Regarding indirect effects, communication quality online positively mediated the effects of mobile phone calls on relationship quality and negatively mediated the effects of mobile short messages and Weibo on relationship quality. Moreover, passionate love attitudes (PLAs) and gender negatively moderated the effects of mobile phone calls on relationship depth, indicating that females and individuals who had stronger PLAs had lower relationship quality when they used mobile phone calls to interact with their romantic partners. The moderating effects of PLA were extended to the indirect relationship between phone calls and relationship quality through communication quality. Overall, this study developed a typology to examine mobile relational communication by integrating the quantity (i.e., mobile use frequencies) and quality of mobile communication, as well as personal attitudes in close relationships.

AB  - There is little research examining the confluence of what communication channel is used for which purpose with which person. This study examines the "setting" for communication that includes what is communicated (e.g. positive or negative messages), the nature of the relationship (close versus distant), and the information channel. The respondents to a web-based questionnaire (n = 627) were Norwegian smartphone users aged 16-35 years. Respondents evaluated mobile communication services that they used in specific social settings by "checking off" all that apply. Two methods of analysis are used to examine the material. First, a Principal Component Regression validated the main method, namely a mixed model for the Analysis of Variance. Results show the probability of using a mobile communication service is based on the effects of social group, communication purpose, communication channel, and their interaction. The relationship to the interlocutor was found to have the strongest effect on channel choice. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The identification of the best learning style in an Intelligent Tutoring System must be considered essential as part of the success in the teaching process. In many implementations of automatic classifiers finding the right student learning style represents the hardest assignment. The reason is that most of the techniques work using expert groups or a set of questionnaires which define how the learning styles are assigned to students. This paper presents a novel approach for automatic learning styles classification using a Kohonen network. The approach is used by an author tool for building Intelligent Tutoring Systems running under a Web 2.0 collaborative learning platform. The tutoring systems together with the neural network can also be exported to mobile devices. We present different results to the approach working under the author tool.

AB  - Using technology to create new types of questions is important, but also exploring new types of test representations or analyzing the most adequate technological device to support a specific assessment activity based on tests. This paper presents a conceptual model that defines and relates three dimensions to be considered for advancing on Computing-Based Testing (CBT): the Question-item, the Test and the Activity. The framework assists in the categorization and design of advanced CBT scenarios and opens a new domain for questions and tests supported by ICT. Besides, the paper proposes two models for the technological design and implementation of the Test and Question-item dimensions. The models represent an extension of the IMS Question and Test Interoperability standard. They are platform-independent models (PIMs) that formulate the elements that can be mapped to platform-specific models (PSMs) for implementing advanced CBT solutions. To show the relevance, value and usability of the contributions, the paper also describes the application of the framework and PIMs to design and implement three exemplary CBT scenarios with their corresponding CBT-PSMs. Within the global scope of the CBT conceptual model, the first scenario shows how question-items can be enriched with specific multimedia information (web maps). The second scenario illustrates another particular case of the CBT domain where a test can be augmented with real physical elements. And finally, the third scenario describes an implementation that combines advanced question-items and tests using virtual worlds. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Microblogging and mobile devices appear to augment human social capabilities, which raises the question whether they remove cognitive or biological constraints on human communication. In this paper we analyze a dataset of Twitter conversations collected across six months involving 1.7 million individuals and test the theoretical cognitive limit on the number of stable social relationships known as Dunbar’s number. We find that the data are in agreement with Dunbar’s result; users can entertain a maximum of 100–200 stable relationships. Thus, the ‘economy of attention’ is limited in the online world by cognitive and biological constraints as predicted by Dunbar’s theory. We propose a simple model for users’ behavior that includes finite priority queuing and time resources that reproduces the observed social behavior.

AB  - The article addresses the role of network and mobile technologies in enhancing blended solutions with a view to (a) enriching the teaching/learning processes, (b) exploiting the opportunities it offers for their observability, and hence for their monitoring and formative/summative assessment. It will also discuss how such potential can only be captured by solidly integrating the process of instructional design with that of monitoring and assessment. First, the article presents the proposed conception of blended solutions, giving examples. In the second part, the article discusses a possible breakdown of blended solutions into its various components and how these can enrich both the teaching/learning and the assessment processes. Finally, it addresses the question of how to combine and/or use singly the various components of blended solutions. To conclude, implications for the implementation of blended solutions are discussed, also in relation to emerging contexts such as Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs).

AB  - With the boom of mobile Internet and the popularization of smartphones, live streaming platforms have become an important marketing tool for online and physical stores. Based on signal theory and cognitive psychology, this paper discusses how the information content on live streaming platforms influences the impulse purchase of consumers, and how the influence is affected by psychological distance and streamer admiration of consumers. First, several hypotheses were put forward about the mediation role of psychological distance and the moderation role of streamer admiration. Then, the research data were collected through a questionnaire survey among the audience of live streaming platforms, and were analyzed through hierarchical regression to test the hypotheses. The results show that the information content of live streaming platforms has a significant positive impact on the impulse purchase of consumers; this impact is mediated by the psychological distance; the relationship between information content and psychological distance is moderated by streamer admiration. The research results provide new insights into the marketing effect of live streaming platforms and live streamers. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study analyses the effects of perceived relevance and perceived vulnerability on approach and avoidance intentions toward location-based mobile marketing (LBMM) and investigates the moderating effect of privacy self-efficacy (PSE). For this, the study considers two types of consumers' approach intentions and two types of their avoidance intentions to provide a better understanding of LBMM adoption. The results of an online survey of 1864 mobile phone users in the USA indicate that perceived relevance had positive effects of both types of consumers' approach intentions but negative effects only on their willingness to refuse. In addition, perceived vulnerability had positive effects on both types of consumers' avoidance intentions as well as their willingness to pretest. PSE had significant moderating effects on the relationships between perceived relevance/perceived vulnerability and approach/avoidance intentions. These results have important theoretical and practical implications. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - My study extended TAM to include individuals’ intention to use mobile wireless technology (MWT). It added two new constructs, Perceived Cost Savings and Company’s Willingness to Fund, and two causal relationships, Job Relevance and Experience, as moderating effects. The 286 sets of data collected in an online survey were tested against the model using SEM. Results supported my new model: the new constructs and variables accounted for 62.7% of the variance found in an individual’s behavioral intention to use MWT. The path coefficients between the constructs ranged from 0.26 to 0.85 also supporting the model. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Abstract: This study draws on the uses and gratifications framework to examine expanded use of a hybrid medium—the mobile phone—for mass communications and entertainment. Results of a telephone survey of 208 users show different motivations predict diverse uses of the mobile phone. Instrumental use motives drive the use of the mobile phone for news-seeking and Web-surfing. Further, the motive of pass time is significantly linked to playing video games via the mobile phone. In addition, the high-tech mobile phone enabled users to be more active: the more intensively people use mobile phones for voice calls, the more likely they will be to use mobile data services. Thus, the hybrid mobile phone bridges interpersonal and mass communication. Finally, younger users are more likely to use mobile phones for getting news and entertainment. Implications for the industry and recommendations for future research are discussed. [Copyright &y& Elsevier]

AB  - Reports an error in 'Multi-device use: Understanding the motivations behind switching between multiple devices during a task' by Chi-Wen Chen and Marios Koufaris (International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction, Advanced Online Publication, Feb 15, 2020, np). When the article above was first published, the affiliation of the second author was incorrectly stated as ‘Department of Information Systems, Zicklin School of Business, Baruch College, City University of New York, New York, USA’. The correct author’s affiliation is ‘Paul H. Chook Department of Information Systems and Statistics, Zicklin School of Business, Baruch College, City University of New York, New York, New York, USA’ (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2020-11809-001[/rid]). Multi-device use has become a popular pattern of device use in recent years. However, empirical studies pertaining to motivations behind intention to use multiple devices have been limited. The objective of this study focuses on answering an essential question: given that heterogeneous devices are available to users, why do users use multiple devices rather than a single device to complete a task? Both Task-Technology Fit Theory and mental workload paradigm are considered to develop eight hypotheses and build the research framework. A trip-planning scenario was designed and used in the questionnaire to understand the factors that motivate users to use multiple devices. A total of 217 subjects completed the questionnaire. The results show that perceived task fit with multi-device use forms users’ attitudes toward and expected satisfaction with multi-device use. Furthermore, users’ attitudes toward multi-device use trigger their intentions to use multiple devices. Additionally, perceived complexity of multi-device use hinders users from perceiving good task fit with multi-device use. Implications for theory, practice, and future research directions are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Comments on an article by S. Haar et al. (see record [rid]2015-24912-024[/rid]). Haar et al. addressed a question by examining whole-brain directional selectivity with multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) of fMRI data collected while human subjects performed a visuomotor adaption task. In contrast to traditional univariate analyses that average activity across relatively large brain regions, MVPA offers a refined framework that can reveal information represented by fine patterns of spatial activation. This allows researchers to decode cognitive representations from brain activity and to dissociate between neural mappings that would otherwise show the same overall level of activation. They implemented a slow event-related fMRI design in which participants made out-and-back hand movements to one of four visual targets. All movements were performed on a small MRI-compatible tablet that provided the participants online cursor feedback and recorded precise movement kinematics. Haar et al. have convincingly shown that mIPS, in addition to multiple brain regions along the motor hierarchy, can dissociate between reaches to different directions and that coding in mIPS is not specific to only the visual or motor components of the task.

AB  - In an ideal world, once you have decided you want an academic job—whether at a large research university, a small teaching university, or one of the many positions in between—you peruse the job ads posted online and find several positions that fit your research and teaching interests perfectly. You send out your application to the respective search committees. Within a few weeks, you receive either a phone call or an email from the chair of the search committee asking if you are still interested in the position. Assuming you are still interested, this person will help you make arrangements to come to the university for several days for an extended interview and formal talk. While at the interview (which lasts for two days and continues throughout all of your meals), you show interest in the department and university and highlight how your research and teaching fits well with their needs. You ask thought-provoking, yet uncontroversial questions. You give a dazzling and well organized job talk that convinces the audience that your work and teaching style are impressive. Although they must interview two more people for the position, and thus you must wait another few weeks to hear, they finally call you with a job offer which you gladly accept.

AB  - New opportunities have recently emerged in survey practice, coupled with a need to make changes, and alternative survey data collection modes such as those based on new technologies (for example, the Web and mobile phones) have become a focus of interest. Studies have considered the biases due to data collection modes and to the wording of questions in questionnaires, but they have rarely dealt with the interaction between the two phenomena. This paper presents the results of a study on the interactions between some of the best-known question-wording effects and three data collection modes: face-to-face, Web-based and SMS-based (Short Text Messaging). The results have highlighted some interesting characteristics of the various modes—innovative ones in particular—and have confirmed the existence of potential interactions between data collection modes and question-wording effects. The findings may have significant implications for the study and practice of surveys and entail that, when surveys are designed, account is taken of specific factors associated with the method used to word the questions in questionnaires.

AB  - This paper examines the experiences of undergraduate university students in response to the employment of video podcasts to support learning and teaching about exotic ecosystems. Six, 15–20-minute podcasts were made accessible to students through a virtual learning environment, either online or to download to mobile technology. The students were free to watch the podcasts whenever and wherever they chose to. The perceived and actual effectiveness of the technology was assessed by written questionnaire, focus groups and summative assessment results. Students agreed that the podcasts were effective in supporting learning and teaching on the course, largely by offering a flexible and visual learning experience. The podcasts were also perceived as a useful resource for revision and assessment, providing visual images that stimulated factual recall and highlighted knowledge gaps. There were no significant differences, however, in examination essay grades comparing cohorts prior to and post adoption of podcasts. The key to improving the student learning experience appears to lie not in adopting new pedagogy, but in reflexively developing the existing pedagogic strategies employed by both teachers and learners. Of primary importance is uniting the individual learning experience of podcasts with group exploration and critical discussion in a collaborative learning framework.

AB  - This article presents and discusses three different approaches to the exploration of the cross-media challenges facing news audiences, as they seek access to, navigate in and make sense of the multitude of news sources across print, broadcasting, online and mobile media platforms. From a modernized uses and gratifications perspective, based on the notion of “worthwhileness” as the determinant of people's everyday selections from the “supermarket of news”, the article first reports from a longitudinal survey study in Denmark in which the author's foundational mapping of cross-media news consumption in pre-mobile 2008 is compared with replicating mappings carried out in 2011 and 2012, in a collaborative project between academics and news publishers. The analytical interest here focuses on the fluctuations between traditional news media and the surging digital news outlets of the internet and mobile devices. Secondly, the article summarizes the findings of a qualitative study of citizens' news repertoires, which was fortified with a quantitative factor analysis in order to find patterns in people's news consumption. Thirdly, findings are presented from a 2013 study that explored ubiquitous news consumption, asking respondents to specify the nexus of news platform and location of use. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

AB  - ABSTRACT Contemporary audiences have abundant access to news anywhere, anytime and through a wide range of media. Due to the short length of news items, they do not require prolonged attentional focus. Consequently, the genre is consequential for performing simultaneous activities, which are related (i.e. second screening) or unrelated (i.e. media multitasking) to the content of the news items. Despite the potential of second screen activities to increase the political participation of young people, and the fact that adolescents are heavy users of digital media, there is almost no data on the extent to which they perform such activities. Also, there are almost no comparative data about the rates of news video consumption of adolescents vs. adults. This descriptive study analyzes how adolescents and adults consume news video content in an era of second screens. For four consecutive days, subjects reported their viewing behaviors using a dedicated mobile application. Results demonstrate that adolescents consume significantly less news video content compared to adults; smartphones occupy a more prominent role in their news consumption behavior compared to adults; and they are significantly more involved in Second Screening activities. Implications of the findings for understanding adolescents’ contemporary media ecology are examined. Impact Summary (a) Prior State of Knowledge Young people are the primary age group that consumes news content mainly on digital platforms, and simultaneously performs multitasking and second screening activities. (b) Novel Contributions Adolescents’ consumption habits are significantly different from those of adults: they consume less news, the smartphone occupies a more prominent role in their news consumption behavior, and they are significantly more involved in second screening activities. (c) Practical implications The question of how adolescents consume news content has sparked significant interest of scholars and parents alike. As adolescents are in a developmental stage in which they socialize and acquire habits that will affect them later in life, an understanding of their media consumption habits can have significant consequences contemporarily, and possibly at later stages in their lives. The paper provides novel insights about adolescents’ news consumption patterns. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This article combines data from the British National Readership Survey, the Audit Bureau of Circulations, and comScore to calculate how much audience attention newspapers' print, personal computer (PC), and mobile platforms attract. The results show that, of the time spent with 11 UK national newspaper brands by their British audiences, 88.5 per cent still comes via their print editions, 7.49 per cent via mobiles, and just 4 per cent via PCs. The study reveals that the "share of consumption" of UK national newspaper brands (when measured by time spent) is less evenly distributed than commonly understood, conforming better to a logarithmic pattern than a linear one, and that a single brand-The Mail-has close to a 30 per cent market share. Such data should inform debates on, and the regulation of, media plurality. For publishers, this research calls into question the transition from print to online, showing how "dead-tree" editions are their most important platform. However, the circulation of print editions is in steep decline and newspapers' fortunes are falling almost as steeply. Unless the qualities that make newsprint so much more engaging than online journalism can be harnessed to propel a reading resurgence, newspapers' decline will continue, with important social, cultural, and political consequences.

AB  - This study examines the causal-effect relationship between telecommunication infrastructures, economic growth and development in selected African countries. It further estimates the trivariate impacts of telecommunication infrastructures, economic growth and development in the region. The analysis considers a panel of forty-six African countries from 2000 to 2015. To measure economic growth, real gross domestic product serves as the proxy, while economic development is measured by the Human Development Index, and telecommunication infrastructures by a composite index of telecommunication computed from mobile line, fixed line and internet access penetration via principal component analysis (PCA). The empirical results suggest the existence of a bidirectional long-run relationship between telecommunication infrastructures, economic growth and development. The causality tests reveal that there is feedback causality between telecommunication infrastructures, economic growth and development. Telecommunication infrastructures promote economic growth and development in Africa and vice versa. Thus, there is need to promote inclusive and holistic policies that will enhance digital provide, economic growth and development simultaneously in Africa. An increase in telecommunication infrastructures will encourage aggregate output and standard of living to move in the same direction in Africa. • Feedback relationships exist between telecommunication, economic growth and development in Africa. • Telecommunication, economic growth and development are interdependent in Africa. • Telecommunication, economic growth and development need concurrent overhaul in Africa.

AB  - This study examined relations between a cross-cultural geographically mobile childhood and adulthood cultural homelessness, attachment to cross-cultural identities, and self esteem. Cross-cultural identities are loosely defined identities (e.g., third culture kids, military brats, missionary kids) that describe some individuals' childhood cross-cultural experience. The 475 participants spent at least two years before age 18 in a country different from their parents’ home culture, then returned to the latter. They completed an online survey which included general demographic information regarding cross-cultural experiences in childhood, as well as the Cultural Homelessness Criteria, the Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale, and items that evaluated the strength of affirmation, belonging, and commitment to a self-labeled cross-cultural identity. Cultural homelessness was related to lower self esteem scores; higher affirmation, belonging and commitment to any cross-cultural identity was related to higher self esteem and lower cultural homelessness. Furthermore, such affirmation, belonging, and commitment buffered the cultural homelessness–self esteem association, whereas just having a cross-cultural identity did not.

AB  - Media ecology suggests that the anyone, anywhere, anytime slogan of the ubiquitous society characterizes our times. A priori, mobile technology in the “digital ecosystem" fits this circumstance. However, if we delocalize to a remote area, this initial assumption changes. Results of a case study analyzing the use and appropriation of mobile phones in the indigenous Amazon Shuar communities show a different reality that could be labeled ‘intermittent ubiquity'. How does the delocalization facilitated by mobile telephones affect a remote area? How do Ecuadorian Shuars appropriate digital mobile technology? How does technological novelty become apparent in a context that is currently ‘off the grid'?

AB  - Smartphone use influences teenagers' behaviors and lifestyles, not always in a positive way. Abuse and dependence on the use of this device is what has led to the study of nomophobia. The objective of this research is to measure the level of nomophobia in adolescents, and to study their digital consumption habits. The study seeks to analyze the relationships between risk of nomophobia, digital behavior, age and smartphone use. A structured questionnaire has been applied to a sample of 850 students aged 12 to 16. The data has been analyzed with SPSS and SPAD. Multivariate statistical characterization, one of the most recent data mining techniques, has been used to study differences in teenagers' behaviors according to their risk of nomophobia, and to find related explanatory variables. Teenagers' nomophobia risk ranges from mild to moderate, showing a relation with age, academic performance and intensity of use of mobile social networking apps. The risk of nomophobia responds to differences in students' digital, social, relational and educational behaviors, and exhibits differences according to academic performance, age, gender, motivation and self-perception.

AB  - The number of respondents who access Web surveys on a mobile device (smartphone or tablet) has been increasing rapidly over the last few years. Compared with desktop computers, mobile devices have smaller screens, different input options, and are used in a larger variety of locations and situations. The suspicion that the quality of data may suffer when online respondents use mobile devices has stimulated a growing body of research, which has mainly focused on paradata and Web survey design. To investigate whether the respondents' device affects the quality of Web survey data, the authors examined the responses of 1,826 mobile device and desktop participants in a political online survey that asked questions about the 2013 German federal election. To determine the reliability and validity of data submitted via mobile devices, the consistency of the participants' responses was determined across questions and the responses were validated against various internal and external criteria. Replicating previous findings, mobile device respondents were younger and more likely to be female, and they produced higher dropout rates and longer completion times than desktop respondents. However, data produced by respondents using mobile devices were as consistent, reliable, and valid as data produced by respondents using desktop computers. These findings contradict the notion that mobile device users compromise the reliability and validity of data collected online and suggest that researchers do not necessarily need to be afraid of the participation of mobile device respondents in Web surveys.

AB  - Aims and objectives: To report the informatics competencies of students in selected undergraduate and graduate nursing programmes, to examine whether informatics competencies differed between the different programmes and to suggest competency- based applications that will strengthen informatics courses and informatics-related content throughout the curricula. Background: Nursing students in undergraduate and graduate nursing programmes have different educational backgrounds and different practice experience. Thus, their informatics preparation is apt to be varied, and nursing curricula must reflect this variation while advancing students towards informatics proficiency. However, studies on informatics competency assessment in these nursing students are scarce. Design: A descriptive survey design. Methods: Data were collected from 289 nursing students using a 30-item Self-Assessment of Nursing Informatics Competencies Scale via an email sent to students using a LISTSERV mailing list. The email embedded link to the Internet survey package, SurveyMonkey, which included the Self-Assessment of Nursing Informatics Competencies Scale and demographic questions along with an online consent form. Results: Students in both programmes were competent in three subscale areas: basic computer knowledge and skills, clinical informatics attitude, and wireless device skills. Graduate students reported slightly higher mean competency scores than did undergraduate students in three subscales: clinical informatics role, clinical informatics attitude and wireless device skills. Conclusions: Findings indicate specific topics for nurse educators to consider when designing informatics curricula. The comparison of undergraduate and graduate students indicates similarities in informatics competencies in terms of areas where students were competent and small mean score differences. Further studies are suggested to examine whether there are differences in informatics competencies between undergraduate and graduate students. Relevance to clinical practice: These results assist nurse educators in determining specific areas of informatics content that need greater focus and inclusion in the design of better nursing educational programmes. Examples of integrating competencies into existing curriculum or informatics courses are suggested. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Compared within-group self-disclosure via mobile messaging applications (MMAs) vs face-to-face (FtF) interactions. 357 adults (mean age 25 years) were surveyed about self-disclosure behaviors within a relational-oriented group (e.g., family or friendship cliques). Participants were instructed to specify the group they would be considering during the survey, and to answer items on behalf of that group. Thus, the assumption was that participants' responses would validly reflect actual group self-disclosure behavior. Self-disclosure behaviors for online and offline modes were analyzed in terms of amount, depth, breadth, and valence. Overall, MAA communication was more frequent than FtF communication. There was more breadth and more depth for FtF self-disclosure, but it also had a more negative valence than MMA self-disclosure. The results suggest that despite the constant availability of online communication, members of established social groups do not readily disclose personal information to each other online. Instead, FtF interactions appear to be the preferred environment in which to self-disclose.

AB  - In contrast to the prominent individualistic view on self-disclosure, this study focuses on self-disclosure in groups of prior acquaintances that both meet offline and communicate online. It compares within-group self-disclosure between offline face-to-face (FtF) interactions and online communication via mobile messaging applications (MMAs). An online-survey (N = 357) was conducted to test for differences between within-group self-disclosure online and offline across four dimensions (amount, depth, breadth, valence). The results show that there is more amount, more breadth and more depth for offline within-group self-disclosure, but it is less positively valenced than online within-group self-disclosure. Interestingly, the mere frequency of communication is higher in an MMA environment. In spite of the permanent availability of the online communication sphere, group members do not permanently disclose personal information to each other online. Thus, for within-group self-disclosure, offline time seems quality time. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In this article I address some images, categories and open-ended trajectories of the laptop in music production. The aim is to explore the laptop's increasing presence in the sites of music, from cyberspace to live venues, as well as the relationship between music and mobile computerized space. Implicit in the article is the claim that the laptop is a neglected device, but that close attention to its position in cultural networks and everyday settings is one way of examining some possible ways into the complex entanglements and layerings of mobile space. The first part of the article explores the laptop as the archetypal nomadic machine of the digital age, inserted into mobile networks, hubs and flows. The laptop mediates mobility and by doing so not only serves macro-processes of social and economic change, but also opens up creative possibilities for the musician beyond the studio and the home. The second part of the article examines the role of software in activating the laptop's capabilities. The growth of music software and Virtual Studio Technology in the early 2000s, it will be argued, represents a major transformation in music production. A case study is made of a single application, Ableton Live, to show that new forms of music software encourage norms of creativity and play that take it beyond emulations of hardware studios. A residual distrust of the laptop's automative capabilities, however, reprises an anxiety in the history of popular music around questions of creativity and musicianship. The final part explores this anxiety and argues that the laptop is a place-holder for conflicting meanings about what belongs in music: productivity and creation, reality and virtuality, play and work, the cybernetic and the organic. It thereby reveals socio-technical imbroglios in action, where digitized music and software code meet the material properties of technologies and the practices of users in complex, networked societies.

AB  - This paper investigates issues related to the use of mobile phones by people aged 60 years and over and characteristics of an ageing-friendly mobile phone. This study combines qualitative and quantitative analysis methods of Delphi interviews, focus group discussions, and online survey. The expert interviews and the focus group discussions covered usage patterns, problems, benefits, and desired and unwanted features. The issues raised in the discussions were translated into an online survey of 100 people. This study revealed that older people are passive users of mobile phones, that they experience fear of consequences of using unfamiliar technology, and that most preferred design features are aids for declining functional abilities. Gender differences in preferred design features were observed, with women focusing on haptic aids and men on perceptual aids. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Multitasking on digital devices during social interactions has become increasingly common, but research on this behavior is far from thorough. Expanding on literature of phubbing and technoference, the authors proposed a theoretical framework, digital social multitasking, defined as performing technology-based multitasking during a social interaction, to study the behavior. This mixed-methods study focused on one type of digital social multitasking: phone use during a face-to-face interaction with a friend. Self-report survey data were collected from 222 college students (Mage = 19.87; 82% female; 45% Black or African American, 43% White or European American). Results showed that digital social multitasking mostly took place when the face-to-face interaction was casual, and the majority of the phone-based activities were shared between the participant and the friend. Participants did not hold a negative view of their own or friend’s digital social multitasking, but when they saw their own multitasking as distracting or friend’s multitasking as dismissive, they reported lower friendship quality and higher loneliness. The level of one’s own and friend’s multitasking did not directly associate with friendship quality and loneliness; they only indirectly associated with the well-being outcomes via negative perception of the behavior. Friend’s digital social multitasking had stronger associations with poor socioemotional well-being when the face-to-face interactions were serious in nature. Overall, the socioemotional implications of college emerging adults’ phone use during peer interactions did not seem as alarming as what many may have believed, and the implications were contingent upon the context of the behavior.

AB  - This paper presents and discusses the initial findings of a mobile language learning project undertaken in the context of an undergraduate distance-learning French language programme at The Open University (UK). The overall objective of the project was to investigate students' experiences when using their own portable devices for additional listening and speaking practice within a course. Experience data were collected via weekly online questionnaires, recorded oral feedback and email. The use of iPods and MP3 players was quickly adopted by project participants; but whilst the challenge and the authentic aspect of doing activities on the phone appealed to some learners, we conclude that other learners will need to be helped towards recognizing the specific value of this type of practice as a stepping stone towards authentic communication. We suggest further areas of investigation and potential applications. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This chapter is, in many respects, an attempt to codify a series of questions that 1:1 schools have had to answer, whether they did so deliberately or on the fly. It is meant to prepare you for the many issues that you will face on the way to a successful 1:1 program. What it does not do is speak to the influential, authentic change you will see if your school does this well. When combined with a powerful change in pedagogical practice, a 1:1 computing program can help students and teachers create a learning environment that is truly transformative for all involved. The potential to create new ideas and solve problems when a digital device is in the hands of your students—along with access to the open-ended, accessible tools of Web 2.0—can move schools from enclosed institutions surrounded by four walls to organizations at the forefront of deep and expansive learning.

AB  - Presents a study which aims to assess the measurement equivalence (ME) of two sets of data obtained from a questionnaire administered using an online survey and in paper form. The participants were 367 pre-service teachers who were randomly divided into two groups: online and paper-based. Prior to testing for ME, preliminary analyses were performed to ensure that the sample size was adequate and multivariate normality in the data was met. The results support the presence of ME in the data obtained from the online and paper-based surveys in this study, suggesting a lack of significant variance in the data from the two modes of administration. It is expected that with the rapid growth and development of the Internet, the use of online surveys to collect data will increase. In addition, with the advancement of mobile and web 2.0 tools, researchers would be spoilt for choices when deciding which survey platform to use.

AB  - The generation of trajectories for a biped robot is a problem which has been largely studied for several years, and many satisfying offline solutions exist for steady-state walking in absence of disturbances. The question is a little more complex when the generation of the desired trajectories of joints or links has to be achieved or adapted online, i.e. in real time, for example when it is wished to strongly synchronize these trajectories with an external motion. This is precisely the problem addressed in this paper. Indeed, we consider the case where the 'master' motion is measured by a position sensor embedded on a human leg. We propose a method to synchronize the motion of a robot or of other device with respect to the output signal of the sensor. The main goal is to estimate as accurately as possible the current phase along the gait cycle. We use for that purpose a model based on a nonlinear oscillator, which we associate an observer. Introducing the sensor output in the observer allows us to compute the oscillator phase and to generate a synchronized multilinks trajectory, at a very low computational cost. The paper also presents evaluation results in terms of robustness against parameter estimation errors and velocity changes in the input. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Abstract Workforce mobility and diversity are now the reality for many businesses, requiring employers to facilitate their employees’ acquisition of foreign languages (FLs). Developing communicative competencies in an FL is necessary to fulfill the demands of an international workplace. Increasingly, companies have done so with the support of commercial apps and virtual-classroom systems. An example is the language learning company Babbel, which provides corporate clients with the package ‘Babbel Intensive.’ This package comprises app subscription as well as virtual-classroom credits, both aiming to improve spoken competence in an FL. The present study investigated learners’ perceptions of workplace communication in an FL and the impact of Babbel Intensive on their skills. Moreover, the study examined beliefs Babbel Intensive users hold about language learning, as well as the types of motivation they exhibit. We followed a sequential mixed-method research design, comprising explorative qualitative in-depth interviews with 7 users and a subsequent survey with 52 users. Our findings show that learners use the FL learned with the Babbel Intensive package for email exchanges as well as conversations with business partners. The main challenges they experience revolve around vocabulary, grammar, and speaking skills. Babbel Intensive is regarded as exerting a positive impact upon these difficulties, especially through the personalization of classes. In terms of learner beliefs, users highlight that online learning can be associated with struggle but also with personal development and flexibility. Moreover, learners are shown to have varying types of motivation, primarily categorizable as extrinsic motivation. Our findings highlight the affordances and constraints of virtual-classroom solutions to workplace communication in an FL from the point of view of the mobile and diverse workforce of international companies.

AB  - Measuring the success of mobile government (m-government) is a significant challenge faced by the public sector today, as governments are increasingly using mobile technology to provide public services to citizens and m-government endeavors have often fallen short of their potential. To address this gap, we draw on DeLone and McLean’s (2003) updated information systems (IS) success model in order to develop an m-government success model that theorizes service quality as comprising online and offline service quality and further uses perceived value to measure net benefits. The results of a survey of 286 m-government users in China indicate that information quality and online service quality, but not system quality, are positively associated with citizen satisfaction, which in turn is positively associated with perceived value. The results also show that the relationship between online service quality and citizen satisfaction is positively moderated by offline service quality, while citizen satisfaction partially mediates the relationships between information quality/online service quality (but not system quality) and perceived value. This study extends the updated IS success model by differentiating between online and offline service quality, as well as by introducing the notion of perceived value. Our results provide guidance to researchers and practitioners regarding the role of service quality and perceived value in measuring m-government system success.

AB  - Background: With advancing marijuana legalization in the United States, a primary concern is the possible increase in consequences relating to marijuana driving impairment, especially among people who use high-potency marijuana (i.e., extracts). In this study, the research team assessed the risk perception and experiences of driving under the influence of marijuana by investigating people who use extracts. Methods: Participants from 2 studies were queried about driving after using marijuana. In Study 1, phone interviews (n = 19) were conducted with people who use extracts. In Study 2, people who use extracts (n = 174) were recruited to participate in a nationwide survey via an online existing panel. Responses to marijuana and driving–related questions were qualitatively coded for themes (e.g., riskiness, engagement in behavior) developed by the research team. Results: Prominent themes identified in Study 1 suggested a belief that driving risk following marijuana use is dependent on the individual (i.e., response/tolerance) or the amount/type of marijuana consumed. This theme was corroborated by Study 2 participants. Those who perceived no or minimal risk from driving following marijuana use were more likely to report engagement in driving following extracts use. Conclusions: More research is needed to understand how marijuana, especially in its concentrated form, impacts driving ability in order to develop appropriate and scientifically sound regulations. Such research could subsequently fill the need to improve and more widely disseminate prevention messages on marijuana use and driving risks.

AB  - Mobile design and use has evolved immensely in the last decade, and we are in the middle of a paradigm shift in survey research, invoked by what Conrad et al, (2017) have termed 'the mobile revolution'. The mobile revolution poses opportunities and challenges to survey designers. Adopting a responsive and intelligent questionnaire design approach, where the visual presentation of content automatically adjusts to the device's screen size and browser, is seen as a way in which such problems can be addressed. This chapter investigates how different designs, optimized and non-optimized for smartphones, affect results in grid questions on different devices with different screen sizes. In a quasi-experiment implemented in 2015, the chapter compares response patterns in different grid designs. The main findings suggest that design choices with regard to visual presentation and functionality in grids may impact data quality, both for smartphone respondents and respondents using other devices. The chapter considers arguments for adapting questionnaires and grid questions specifically for mobile devices, summarizing what is known about the performance of grid questions on different devices and setting out the rationale for our research and the design of the study.

AB  - Introduction: Self-reported levels of disability in individuals with low back pain (LBP) have not improved in the last decade. A broader perspective and a more comprehensive management framework may improve disability outcomes. We recently developed and validated the Low Back Pain and Disability Drivers Management (PDDM) model, which aims to identify the domains driving pain and disability to guide clinical decisions. The objectives of this study were to determine the applicability of the PDDM model to a LBP population and the feasibility of conducting a pragmatic trial, as well as to explore clinicians’ perceived acceptability of the PDDM model’s use in clinical settings. Methods: This study was an one-arm prospective feasibility trial. Participants included physiotherapists working with a population suffering from LBP and their patients aged 18 years or older presenting with a primary complaint of LBP that sought a new referral and deemed fit for rehabilitation from private and public clinical settings. Clinicians participated in a one-day workshop on the integration of the PDDM model into their clinical practice, and were asked to report various LBP-related outcomes via self-reported questionnaires (i.e., impact of pain on physical function, nervous system dysfunctions, cognitive-emotional factors, work disabilities) at baseline and at six-week follow-up. Physiotherapists’ acceptability of the use of the PDDM model and appreciation of the training were assessed via semi-structured phone interviews. Analyses focused on a description of the model’s applicability to a LBP population, feasibility outcomes and acceptability measures. Results: Applicablity of the PDDM model was confirmed since it successfully established the profile of patients according to the elements of each categories, and each of the 5 domains of the model was represented among the study sample. Trial was deemed feasible contingent upon few modifications as our predefined success criteria for the feasibility outcomes were met but feasibility issues pertaining to data collection were highlighted. Twenty-four (24) clinicians and 61 patients were recruited within the study’s timeframe. Patient’s attrition rate (29%) and clinicians’ compliance to the study protocol were adequate. Clinicians’ perceived acceptability of the use of the model in clinical settings and their appreciation of the training and online resources were both positive. Recommendations to improve the model’s integration in clinical practice, content of the workshop and feasibility of data collection methods were identified for future studies. A positive effect for all patients’ reported outcome measures were also observed. All outcome measures except for the PainDetect questionnaire showed a statistically significant reduction post-intervention (p<0.05). Conclusion: These findings provide preliminary evidence of the potential of the PDDM model to optimize LBP management as well as conducting a future larger-scale pragmatic trial to determine its effectiveness.

AB  - Personal digital assistants (PDA), particularly Palm Pilots, are popular data collection devices in experience sampling research. The declining availability of such devices, however, has prompted researchers to explore alternative technologies for signaling participants and collecting responses. The present research considers interactive voice response (IVR) methods, which can deliver questions and collect data using common cell phones. Participants completed an experience sampling study using either a PDA (n = 428) or a cell phone under three different conditions (IVR condition n = 98; IVR Callback condition n = 93; IVR Callback Comeback condition n = 94). We found that response rates were higher when people used PDAs (69%) than when they used their cell phones (IVR condition = 51%), but response rates increased when people could call back within a few minutes of missing a signal (IVR Callback condition = 58%) and had a face-to-face meeting with a researcher midweek (IVR Callback Comeback = 64%). The daily life ratings were similar across the conditions. The findings are encouraging for researchers interested in using IVR cell phone methods for ecological momentary assessment, but more work is needed to develop procedures or incentives that increase response rates.

AB  - Abstract: With the expansion of telecommunication and online technologies for the purpose of survey administration, the issue of measurement validity has come to the fore. The proliferation of automated audio services and computer-based survey techniques has been matched by a corresponding denigration of the quality of traditional phone survey data, most notably as an outcome of falling response rates. This trend, combined with the introduction of screening technologies and answering machines, represents a barrier to the proper execution of survey research. Whereas the question was once, “can technology-assisted surveys achieve the same level of validity as traditional phone surveys?”, the question now becomes, “what are the relative advantages and disadvantages of technology-assisted and phone surveys?” Each has its own challenges and opportunities, and this paper begins to explore these. The present study provides further insight into the validity of telephone and Internet survey data, and explores whether or not the robustness of relationships between variables varies by survey mode. Study data were provided by two surveys, the first of which was conducted in a metropolitan area of the Midwestern US, with interviews of 505 adults using a computer-aided telephone-interviewing (CATI) system. The second was a national survey of 2172 respondents conducted over the Internet by a commercial research firm that sends requests to a diverse set of potential respondents, who logged onto the survey site to participate. Results suggest that weighting in an attempt to achieve parametric matching does seem to increase robustness of relationships and, in this age of poor response rates, this seems to demand an increased use of parametric weightings. Implications of study findings for telematic survey practitioners are discussed. [Copyright &y& Elsevier]

AB  - This study aimed to test the possible moderating role of parents' emotional stability on the relationship between parent distraction with technology and child social competence during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data used in the study were collected in May 2020 when extensive restrictive measures, labeled as lockdown, were present in Croatia. Data on technoference in parenting, parents' problematic phone tendencies, and child social competence were collected using an online questionnaire from parents (n = 281) of children aged 3 to 14 years. The results show a significant negative effect of overall technoference in parenting on child social competence. This negative effect was significantly moderated by parents' emotional stability, as expected. Medium and high levels of parents' emotional stability buffer the negative effect of low technoference in parenting on child social competence. Results imply technoference in parenting negatively affects child development, but the emotional stability of parents can be a protective factor. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background: Children born with permanent hearing loss have the opportunity to receive services earlier as a result of newborn hearing screening (NHS). We conducted a survey to address three aspects within the early hearing detection and intervention (EHDI) process; (1) timeliness of service delivery, (2) hearing device access, and (3) hearing aid management. Parent experiences provide valuable information in identifying existing challenges for these components of the EHDI system. Purpose: The aim was to investigate parent experiences as they access and manage hearing aids for their child. Research Design: A cross-sectional, population-based survey was used. Study Sample: Three hundred fifty-two completed surveys from parents of children born between 1977 and 2010 were returned from 45 states in the United States. Data Collection and Analysis: Responses were obtained online and through the mail, and were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: Over time, the age of hearing loss identification has decreased to a median of 2 mo, age of first hearing aid fitting has decreased to a median of 5 mo, and the delay between hearing loss identification and hearing aid fitting has remained the same with a median of 2 mo. For children born between 2007 and 2010, the top three challenges parents reported in obtaining hearing aids were (1) paying for hearing aids, (2) accepting the. need for hearing aids, and (3) wait time for an appointment. Almost one-half (48%) of the parents reported that they did not receive adequate support from their audiologist in how to check the function of their child's hearing aids. Conclusions: Significant progress has been made over the past two decades in reducing the age of hearing loss identification and hearing aid fitting for children who do not pass the NHS. However, many children continue to experience delays between hearing loss diagnosis and hearing aid fitting that exceed Joint Committee on Infant Hearing recommendations. The experiences parents reported provide valuable information about areas that need further investigation to improve the process for children with hearing loss.

AB  - Shared parent–child experiences while engaged with an iPad™ were examined to determine if and then how parents interact with their children when using mobile digital devices. In total, 104 parent–child dyads participated in an observation session where parent–child interactions using the touchscreen tablet device were video recorded in order to observe first-hand the supports and exchanges between parent and child (age range 46.21–75.9 months). Results indicate that parents provide a great deal of support to their children while interacting with the touchscreen tablet device including verbal, emotional-verbal, physical and emotional-physical supports. The types of support offered did not differ as a function of parent gender or experience with mobile devices (users versus non-users). Overall, parents rated their own experience engaging with the touchscreen tablet and that of their child’s positively. Additional survey measures assessed parents’ perceptions of their child’s technology use and attitudes regarding optimal ages and conditions for introducing and using technology. Most parents indicated a preference for very early introduction to mobile technologies. Implications of these findings are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to investigate how, where and when parents are mediating their children’s media activities and with which particular device. It also explores whether parents are identifying specific help in this area and questions where they might seek advice (should they need it). Furthermore, it investigates parents’ views regarding a pilot, free online TV channel dedicated to advice through discussion with experts, parents and children. Design/methodology/approach: This small-scale study uses charts and semi-structured interviews to explore the views of parents/carers to better understand lived experiences in relation to mediated digital parenting in the home. The methodology was also designed so that findings will inform further production of relevant content for a video-based resource. Findings: Although this study was limited in duration and scope, the results clearly support earlier research (Livingstone, 2018a, 2018b; Ofcom, 2017) regarding the desperation parents feel through not being able to access appropriate advice in the way they want it. Furthermore, findings provide overwhelming support for the potential benefits of relevant predominantly visually-based online content/ advice. Practical implications: The study raises questions about the empowerment of parents/carers in their own digital skills as a way of transferring confidence to their children, in navigating their way through the educational and social affordances and online safety issues through the use of accessible filmed content. Originality/value: The findings show that issues, such as online safety and related behavioural pressures, remain key for parents and that there is an increasing need for more targeted support and ways to empower parents/grandparents with skills to enhance children’s digital agency. Furthermore, it offers an insight into ways in which styles of ‘‘enabling mediation’’ in the digital age may be analysed and reveals some of the day to day challenges parents face.

AB  - Purpose: The author describes communication patterns and outcomes of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) intervention for individuals with Angelman syndrome. Method: Parents self-administered a web-based survey using Qualtrics software. A series of rating scales and closed questions were used to gather information about individuals’ current methods of communication, including AAC devices they were using. Individuals’ uses of their single most advanced AAC devices were further explored in terms of associated importance, usefulness, success, acceptance, and functional outcomes. Results: Nonsymbolic methods of communication proved to be very important to individuals, as did electronic AAC devices, although to a lesser extent. Individuals tended to have access to more than one electronic device concurrently. Although numerous devices were cited, mobile technologies, particularly iPads, were especially prevalent. This represented a significant change from a previous investigation. Overall, device use was perceived to be frequently important, accepted, successful, and useful in relation to 8 different factors, although ratings across a series of 19 functional outcomes varied. Differences were noted on several measures when individuals’ ages and educational placements were considered. Conclusion: Results suggest a changing landscape in terms of types of devices used, particularly with respect to mobile technologies, and show clear evidence that device use is often, although not uniformly, associated with positive outcomes.

AB  - Objective: This study assessed patient experiences of using an autoinjector device to self-administer subcutaneous belimumab for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Satisfaction, ease and convenience of use, and confidence with the device were assessed, in addition to overall experience with belimumab. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among patients who completed a phase IIb open-label, multi-dose usability, tolerability, and safety study of subcutaneous belimumab (NCT02124798), in which patients receiving intravenous belimumab or subcutaneous belimumab using a prefilled syringe were switched to eight weekly self-administered doses of subcutaneous belimumab using the autoinjector. This follow-up study comprised an online/paper questionnaire and qualitative telephone interviews. Results: In total, 43 patients receiving belimumab completed the questionnaire, 21 of whom also completed a follow-up telephone interview. Qualitative interviews indicated that 17 of 21 (81%) patients had a positive experience using the autoinjector; all patients considered the autoinjector to be convenient. Of the 42 patients who switched from intravenous belimumab to the autoinjector, 32 (76%) expressed a preference for the autoinjector over intravenous administration; reasons included convenience, time saved, cost, and reduced injection pain. The most commonly reported disadvantage of the autoinjector was injection discomfort (n = 5 [24%]; qualitative interview). Compared with intravenous administration, the autoinjector improved ability to work (17 of 29 [59%] of those employed) and carry out daily activities (40%). Conclusion: Patients with SLE reported high levels of satisfaction with the belimumab autoinjector and preferred the autoinjector to intravenous administration, citing advantages such as time saved, cost, and improved ability to work and carry out daily activities.

AB  - This study investigates whether it is the case that representativity is undermined if personal computer, tablet and smartphone respondents differ in socio-demographic characteristics and display different survey completion rates. Online market research is struggling with sample representativity. The analysis of more than ten million survey invitations, as well as stated device preference information, suggests that web survey respondents who are members of online panels still mostly use their personal computers, but do express increasing interest in using smartphones and tablets. Survey completion rates do vary across devices, and device use is significantly associated with socio-demographic characteristics and length of membership on a panel. Therefore, researchers must not limit respondents to use a specific device for completing a survey as this may compromise the quality of the survey completion experience, increase non-response error and negatively affect representativity.

AB  - Pedestrian crashes are an important issue globally as pedestrians are a highly vulnerable road user group, accounting for approximately 35% of road deaths worldwide each year. In highly motorised countries, pedestrian distraction by hand held technological devices appears to be an increasing factor in such crashes. An online survey (N = 363) was conducted to 1) obtain prevalence information regarding the extent to which people cross the road while simultaneously using mobile phones for potentially distracting activities; 2) identify whether younger adult pedestrians are more exposed to/at risk of injury due to this cause than older adults; and 3) explore whether the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) might provide insight into the factors influencing the target behaviours. Self-reported frequency of using a smart phone for three levels of distraction (visual and cognitive-texting/internet; cognitive only- voice calls; audio only-listening to music) while crossing the road was collected. Results indicated that about 20% of the sample had high exposure to smart phone use while crossing, especially 18–30 year olds who were significantly more likely than other age groups to report frequent exposure. TPB constructs of Attitude, Subjective Norm, and Perceived Behavioural Control significantly predicted intentions to use a smart phone while crossing the road, accounting for 62% of variance in Intentions for the entire sample, and 54% of the variance for 18–30 year olds. Additional variables of Mobile Phone Involvement and Group Norms provided an additional significant 6% of the variance explained for both groups. Attitude was by far the strongest predictor for both the whole sample and for 18–30 year olds, accounting for 38% and 41% explained variance, respectively. This suggests that pedestrians with positive attitudes towards using their smart phones while crossing the road have stronger intentions to do so. Moreover, high exposure was associated with stronger intentions to use a smart phone while crossing, and the effect was large, suggesting high frequency mobile phone use may lead to riskier habits, such as failing to interrupt use while crossing the road. Interventions should target pedestrians under 30 years old and aim to strengthen negative attitudes towards using smart phones while crossing, or to challenge the perceived advantages or emphasise the disadvantages of using one’s phone while crossing in order to reduce intentions to do so. Young people’s perceptions that others in their social group approve of smart phone use while crossing could also be an important factor to address.

AB  - This study examines whether self-perceived popularity, need for popularity, and peer pressure explain teenagers’ use of the mobile phone to make and distribute hurtful pictures and videos of peers and teachers. A large-scale quantitative survey study among 1787 Flemish high school pupils in 2010 revealed that, in the six months prior to the study, 25% of adolescents had made a picture/video of a peer who was being ridiculed, 8% of a peer who was being physically bullied, and 11% had distributed such a picture/video online. Thirteen percent had made a picture/video of a teacher being ridiculed, and 6% had distributed such content online. Self-perceived popularity, need for popularity, and perceived peer pressure positively predicted adolescents’ involvement in several of the above practices. The results suggest that greater investments need to be made to counter the social rewards that adolescents receive when engaging in these bullying practices. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This brief paper uses a simple arithmetic framework to classify and explain the performance of developing countries in closing the absolute digital divide. Four categories are created on the basis of two variables, namely, the penetration and rate of growth of mobile phones. The paper answers questions such as: Which countries do well and badly on both variables? Are the countries in these categories drawn from specific regions or similar income levels or is the distribution more random? How can similar countries from the same region appear in two diametrically opposite categories? What does this imply for policy? (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Mobile instant messaging (MIM) has been gaining in popularity in China due to its free and user-friendly nature. Few scholarly studies have investigated factors affecting the adoption of MIM among Chinese youth. This web survey examined perceived characteristics of MIM and its adopter characteristics among 18 to 30 year-old users in China. The study found that the majority of Chinese youths adopted WeChat and Mobile QQ services and used texting most often. Socialization was their main purpose of using MIM. More than 75% of respondents used it to connect with friends, colleagues, and classmates. The results also showed age had a negative influence on the adoption levels of MIM while compatibility, perceived popularity, and perceived playfulness were positively associated with MIM usage among Chinese youths. Contrary to prior studies, perceived trialability of MIM was negatively related to MIM use. The implications of MIM usage and adoption are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Despite mobile government microblogging service (GMS) initially attracted a huge number of followers, its discontinuance rate remains high. How to lead citizens to continue use mobile GMS is a question that many government agencies are asking. The present study attempts to understand the factors that affect mobile GMS continuance by focusing on the influences of perceived integration and perceived interactivity on citizens’ value evaluations. The research model was empirically tested against data collected from 619 mobile GMS users in China. The results of structural equation modeling analysis shown that perceived (online-offline) integration and perceived (citizen-government) interactivity positively affect both two extrinsic values (information value and social value), and two intrinsic values (hedonic value and emotional value) of using mobile GMS. Information value, social value, and hedonic value in turn further positively affect mobile GMS continuance. However, the influence of emotional value on mobile GMS continuance was not significant. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are also presented. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: We examined patient interest in a telehealth model in which the patient supplies the hardware and Internet connectivity to meet with a healthcare provider from his or her home via video call (video appointment). We hoped to understand prospectively the desirability, feasibility, and viability from the patient perspective. Materials and Methods: A phone survey was conducted of a random sample of patients who had been seen in the outpatient setting at a single institution. The sample was stratified by proximity to the local institution with oversampling for patients living outside a 120-mile radius. Results: Out of 500 total patients, 301 patients responded, and 263 met the inclusion criteria. Of those 263 respondents, 38% indicated 'very likely' to accept an invitation to see their provider via video, 28.1% 'somewhat likely,' and 33.8% 'not at all likely.' Of respondents, 75% have broadband, although only 36% reported having a Web camera. The primary factors affecting willingness to participate in a video appointment include comfort in setting up a video call, age, and distance participants would have traveled for an in-clinic appointment. Conclusions: Patient survey data indicate that most patients are likely to be accepting of telehealth care to the home using video call and that most have the required technology. Nevertheless, there are still significant hurdles to effectively implement this adaptation of telehealth care as part of mainstream practice.

AB  - Objective: Providing instruction for assembly tasks is essential in modern manufacturing industry, as well as in households for customers that buy products to be assembled at home. Recent technological developments might be able to assist in completing an assembly task faster and more accurately. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether performance and usability differs when instructions for an assembly task are presented on digital glasses versus paper. Methods: Participants (n = 63) completed one of three versions of an assembly task (between-subject-design) with LEGO® bricks: (1) with paper instruction (P), (2) with text instructions presented stepwise via digital glasses (GT), (3) with stepwise text and auditory instruction (in parallel) on digital glasses (GA). Outcome measures on performance were completion time and errors. Furthermore, usability was measured by the User Experience Questionnaire, the Standardized Usability Questionnaire, the Post-Study Usability Questionnaire, and cognitive processing skills were assessed by the Trail Making Test and different versions of the Eriksen Flanker Task. Analyses were adjusted for the confounding factors age, gender, experience with glasses and LEGO, and problems with instruction. Results: Findings indicate that task completion was faster with the paper instructions compared to both versions of instruction via digital glasses (GT, GA). We observed no difference in accuracy and usability between the instructions. 'Novelty' was rated higher for instructions for both GT and GA, compared to P. Discussion: Results show that instructions on digital glasses may not always be more effective for assembly than the traditional paper-based instructions. Further studies are necessary to investigate whether effectiveness may depend on task complexity, target group, experience of the user with task and device, and how the information is presented.

AB  - Background: With the availability of mobile smart devices, many adolescents have developed the habit of being online and connected with other users almost all the time. Objective: The aim of this paper is to provide a definition of being permanently online (PO) and permanently connected (PC) and to explore students’ current PO/PC behaviors. Methods: An online survey was conducted with 178 university students in Germany to explore the intensity of their PO/PC behaviors in various social situations, the differences in being PO and being PC, students’ feelings about a possible loss of Internet access, and their online responding behaviors. We also shed some light on the associations between being PO/PC and various aspects of well-being, as well as between PO/PC and demographics and lifestyle. Results: Smart device usage behaviors at night and behaviors in various social situations during the day indicate that PO and PC behaviors are occurring frequently. The results show that being connected to others (PC) seems to be more relevant to the participants than browsing the web (PO). Moreover, the participants expressed strong emotional responses about a temporary loss of Internet access. Coping behaviors in response to increasing number of incoming messages and permanent availability are reported. Conclusion: This exploratory study demonstrates the relevance of the concepts of being PO and PC to students, and points out further research gaps.

AB  - This study examines whether and how network size is associated with diversity and trust in the mobile SNS context. Online survey data (N = 327) on Chinese WeChat users reveal that both personal network size and extended network size are positively related to the diversity of people's social networks. We believe the explanation for these findings may be that the affordances of WeChat provide users opportunities to accumulate a wide spectrum of relations ranging from strong ties, weak ties to latent ties and thus a larger network can enable them to access to more diverse resources. We also find that extended network size is negatively related to people's trust in their WeChat contacts. We argue that the increasing size of the extended network may reduce familiarity, certainty and accountability that assumed to be prerequisites of trust. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Die zunehmende Verfügbarkeit von hochdimensionalen, feinkörnigen Daten über menschliches Verhalten, die bei Studien mit mobilen Sensoren und in Form von digitalen Fußabdrücken gesammelt werden, wird die Art und Weise, wie Persönlichkeitspsychologen Forschung betreiben und Persönlichkeitsbeurteilungen vornehmen, drastisch verändern. Diese neuen Arten und Mengen von Daten werfen wichtige Fragen darüber auf, wie die Daten zu analysieren und die Ergebnisse angemessen zu interpretieren sind. Modelle des maschinellen Lernens sind für diese Art von Daten gut geeignet, da sie es den Forschern ermöglichen, hochkomplexe Beziehungen zu modellieren und die Generalisierbarkeit und Robustheit ihrer Ergebnisse mit Hilfe von Resampling-Methoden zu bewerten. Die korrekte Verwendung von maschinellen Lernmodellen erfordert eine spezielle methodische Ausbildung, die die für diese Art der Modellierung spezifischen Probleme berücksichtigt. Hier geben wir zunächst einen kurzen Überblick über bisherige Studien, die maschinelles Lernen in der Persönlichkeitspsychologie einsetzen. Zweitens illustrieren wir die wichtigsten Herausforderungen, denen sich Forscher bei der Erstellung, Interpretation und Validierung von maschinellen Lernmodellen gegenübersehen. Drittens diskutieren wir die Evaluation von Persönlichkeitsskalen, die mit Methoden des maschinellen Lernens abgeleitet wurden. Viertens beleuchten wir einige Schlüsselprobleme, die sich aus der Verwendung von latenten Variablen im Modellierungsprozess ergeben. Wir schließen mit einem Ausblick auf die zukünftige Rolle von maschinellen Lernmodellen in der Persönlichkeitsforschung und -bewertung. (translated by DeepL)
AB  - The increasing availability of high-dimensional, fine-grained data about human behaviour, gathered from mobile sensing studies and in the form of digital footprints, is poised to drastically alter the way personality psychologists perform research and undertake personality assessment. These new kinds and quantities of data raise important questions about how to analyse the data and interpret the results appropriately. Machine learning models are well suited to these kinds of data, allowing researchers to model highly complex relationships and to evaluate the generalizability and robustness of their results using resampling methods. The correct usage of machine learning models requires specialized methodological training that considers issues specific to this type of modelling. Here, we first provide a brief overview of past studies using machine learning in personality psychology. Second, we illustrate the main challenges that researchers face when building, interpreting, and validating machine learning models. Third, we discuss the evaluation of personality scales, derived using machine learning methods. Fourth, we highlight some key issues that arise from the use of latent variables in the modelling process. We conclude with an outlook on the future role of machine learning models in personality research and assessment.

AB  - Adherent dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) includes between‐session phone consultation to help clients generalize skills, solve problems during crises, and repair relationships. Despite benefits of phone consultation, it is frequently not implemented in outpatient settings. The perceived burden phone consultation places on providers is one of the most frequently cited reasons for its omission. The current study examined phone consultation in relation to providers' burnout using a cross‐sectional design. We hypothesized that (1) DBT experience and support from peer consultation team members, including perceived team efficacy and shared coaching responsibilities, would be associated with lower rates of burnout and (2) higher numbers of crisis contacts and 'other' contacts, but not noncrisis skills generalization contacts, would be associated with increased burnout. Participants were 65 DBT therapists who completed an anonymous survey online. Results suggest that both having more effective consultation teams and sharing phone consultation among team members were associated with decreased burnout. Additionally, more crisis contacts were found to be associated with higher burnout, whereas higher number of skills generalization calls was not. This study represents an important first step towards evaluating the impact of phone consultation on providers and highlights the importance of effective peer consultation in reducing therapist burnout.

AB  - Background: Young adults have high rates of tobacco use compared to other subpopulations, yet there are relatively few tobacco interventions specifically targeted to this group. Picture Me Smokefree is an online tobacco reduction and cessation intervention for young adults that uses digital photography and social networking. Objective: The main goal of the project was to determine the feasibility of engaging young adults in participating in user-driven, online forums intended to provide peer support and motivate critical reflection about tobacco use and cessation among this high-use, hard-to-reach population. A related aim was to explore the influence of gender-related factors on participation, in order to determine the need for online interventions to be tailored to the specific gender preferences reflecting young men and women’s participation styles. Methods: A total of 60 young adults ages 19-24 years who self-identified as current cigarette smokers or who had quit within the last year were recruited from across British Columbia, Canada, and participated in an online photo group on Facebook over a period of 12 consecutive weeks. A variety of data collection methods were used including tracking online activity, a brief online follow-up survey, and qualitative interviews with study participants. Data analysis involved descriptive statistics on recruitment, retention, and participation and qualitative (eg, narrative analysis, synthesis of feedback) feedback about participant engagement. Results: Findings from this study suggest good potential for Facebook as an accessible, low-cost platform for engaging young adults to reflect on the reasons for their tobacco use, the benefits of quitting or reducing, and the best strategies for tobacco reduction. Young adults’ frequent use of mobile phones and other mobile devices to access social networking permitted ease of access and facilitated real-time peer-to-peer support across a diverse group of participants. However, our experience of conducting the study suggests that working with young tobacco users can be accompanied by considerable recruitment, participation, and retention challenges. Our findings also pointed to differences in how young women and men engaged the photo-group intervention that should be considered, bearing in mind that in follow-up interviews participants indicated their preference for a mixed gender and 'gender neutral' group format. Conclusions: Tobacco interventions for youth and young adults should be embedded within the existing social networking platforms they access most frequently, rather than designing a stand-alone online prevention or intervention resource. This subpopulation would likely benefit from tobacco reduction interventions that are gender-sensitive rather than gender-specific. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Children with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and intellectual disability (ID), need early intervention and continuous treatment. We aimed to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of mobile application-based interventions in children with ADHD and ID in supporting attention and cognitive function. Twenty-six children with ADHD and/or ID with attention and cognition difficulties were recruited. Participants completed a 12-week mobile application-based intervention. To assess whether digital intervention improved attention and cognitive function, we used the Comprehensive Attention Test (CAT), Cambridge Neuropsychological Tests Automated Battery (CANTAB), and electroencephalography (EEG) to examine direct changes in children's behavior and neural activity. Clinicians and parents assessed changes using the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, Second Edition (BRIEF-2), Korean version of the ADHD Rating Scale (K-ARS), Clinical Global Impression-Improvement Scale, and parental questionnaires. The intervention induced changes in neural activities on EEG and behavior but there were no significant changes in CAT and CANTAB results. Relative theta and alpha power were significantly lower post-intervention in the eyes-open (EO) condition of EEG recording and these changes were mainly observed in the frontal regions of the brain. Parental reports using the BRIEF-2 and K-ARS noted significant improvements in executive function, attention, and hyperactivity-impulsivity. In addition, the clinical impression improved in 60% of participants. These results provide evidence that a mobile application-based intervention has the benefit of supporting children with ADHD and/or ID. Digital intervention could change neural activity and improve children's attention and cognitive function. Given our findings, we suggested that mobile application-based digital therapeutics may have great potential for helping children with neurodevelopmental disorders who need continuous treatment.

AB  - This paper reports on a study of students choosing the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma over state-based curricula in Australian schools. The IB Diploma was initially designed as a matriculation certificate to facilitate international mobility. While first envisaged as a lifestyle agenda for cultural elites, such mobility is now widespread with more people living ‘beyond the nation’ through choice or circumstance. Beck and others highlight how the capacity to cross national borders offers a competitive edge with which to strategically pursue economic and cultural capital. Beck’s ‘border artistes’ are those who use national borders to their individual advantage through reflexive strategy. The study explored the rationales and strategy behind the choice of the IB Diploma curriculum expressed by students in a focus group interview and an online survey. This paper reports on their imagined transnational routes and mobile orientations, and how a localised curriculum limits their imagined mobile futures.

AB  - Adolescents with depression who participate in behavioral activation therapy may find it hard to be motivated to perform tasks at home that their therapists recommend. We describe the initial design and usability evaluation of a home device ('PlantBot') that could be used to remind young adults with depression at home of their behavioral activation therapy-related tasks. The prototype features electronics in a two-layer base, with a fake plant on top and supported using the Amazon Echo voice agent.We use an online panel study to evaluate the usability of our system with youth with past depression (N = 30). Initial findings highlight the device’s usability, potential benefit, and attractiveness of the plant component, as well as multiple improvements to be made.

AB  - The convergence of telecommunications, media, and computing represented by the iPhone has been a dream come true for consumers. For policy makers, however, it has created a nightmare. Policy has been outpaced by technological and industrial advances, as regulators are struggling to accommodate a digital and convergent media landscape. Convergence is a concept that has been active in regulatory discourse since the 1960s. Forty-five years later, the regulatory and policy questions have yet to be resolved. The arrival of the Internet and subsequent accelerated convergence of distribution technologies has created a much larger 'regulatory hangover'—the inability of policy to keep pace with technological developments. This disconnect has become particularly pronounced in the language and concerns of media policy, where technology has transformed communications industries and, in turn, wreaked havoc on the foundational rationales for many regulatory paradigms. This chaos presents pressing economic, technological, and cultural dilemmas about regulation in an era of convergence. Among them: How should regulators treat a device that contains as many platforms, paradigms, and services as the iPhone? How will the battles over the Internet's regulatory classification affect the future of the iPhone and similar devices? How do contemporary regulatory politics determine the ways in which services on the iPhone will be classified and regulated in the future? This chapter will address these dynamics by examining the historical trajectory of regulating broadband networks and the role that the iPhone has played in reconceptualizing the importance of platforms and devices to the pipelines that service them.

AB  - While mobile media, such as low-cost mobiles, smartphones, tablets, and mobile Internet, are being taken up widely around the globe, we have little understanding about their implications for media geographies. In this paper, we take up the question of mobile media geographies via a case study of the 2012 Mexican election – and the student movement called #yosoy132. In this paper, we examine the political and cultural stakes of online and mobile media #yosoy132 entails, arguing for the need to appreciate the specific histories of politics, culture, and technology in which mobile screens unfold in Mexico and its diasporic communities.

AB  - In this paper, the authors define political individualization as a form of networked individualism. This process consists of two components: social individualization and political networking. Social individualization means that people are becoming less strongly connected to traditional communities and experiencing highly differentiated sociability. Political networking refers to the shift from stable connections to formal political movements to dynamic connections to issue networks. This article attempts to investigate whether this process of political individualization is positively related to the use of new media such as the Internet and mobile telephones. There could be two arguments why these two would be positively related. First, the use of new media drives political individualization; the use of new media stimulates individualization since it creates opportunities for individuals to create social connections outside of existing communities. New media also facilitate the formation of political networks. Second, the use of new media and political individualization are both manifestations of a broader process of societal change. The process of modernization results in increasing autonomy of individuals and growing use of technology. This paper does not test these two explanations but rather investigates whether the grounds for both arguments actually exist. The authors have formulated the following research question: Do the new media create opportunities for political individualization and how are these opportunities used? Data from an international survey (918 web questionnaires) of young people in two European cities – Florence and Utrecht – has been used to investigate the research question. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Mobile instant messaging services (MIMS) are emerging as important digital environments in citizens’ everyday lives. We explore the use of MIMS for talking about politics with unique survey data on samples representative of Internet users in Germany, Italy, and the UK. First, we show that robust percentages of our respondents who use MIMS employ them for posting political messages and discussing politics. Second, we demonstrate that political talk on MIMS is positively associated with users’ tendency to censor themselves politically on social networking sites (SNS) and, to a lesser extent, with ideological extremism. Third, we find that the association between self-censorship on SNS and the likelihood of publishing political contents on MIMS is stronger for individuals living in former East Germany where, due to historical reasons, large segments of the population are reluctant to talk about politics in public. Our findings suggest that MIMS make a distinctive contribution to contemporary repertoires of political talk, with important implications for the quality and inclusiveness of interpersonal political discussion.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There has been a continuous increase of smart device use among people with physical disabilities in Korea. In spite of previous research on those people’s motives to adopt smart devices, little investigation has been conducted to scrutinize post-adoption behaviors of using smart devices among people with physical disabilities. OBJECTIVE: /Hypothesis: Based on the post-adoption model, this study examined the relationship between post-adoption beliefs regarding smart devices and behavioral intentions toward continued use of smartphones among people with physical disabilities. Moreover, this study investigated the moderating effects of self-efficacy on the relationships among the main study variables. METHODS: Both online and paper-pencil surveys were conducted, resulting in a total of 108 questionnaires collected from people with physical disabilities. RESULTS: A path analysis showed that, with the exception of perceived ease of use, all variables (confirmation, perceived usefulness, and satisfaction of smart device use) had significant effects on continuance intention to use smart devices. Another main finding of this study was the significant moderating effects of general self-efficacy on the relationships among the three variables of confirmation, perceived usefulness, and continuance intention of smart devices. The relationships among the three variables were significantly stronger among people with lower levels of general self-efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: This study’s main findings will aid the thorough comprehension of the mechanisms that lead people with physical disabilities to continue to use smart devices.

AB  - This article discusses the relationship between theories of photography and mobile phone footage. In doing so, it asks if theories of photography still apply in a technologically saturated world of imagery. Technology is an increasingly important part of viewing imagery today and enables imagery to become part of a global cultural flow, thus calling into question the physical connection between viewer and image. This article analyses what happens to that connection when not only the image but also the physical body is mediated and challenged in post-human relations, and examines the ensuing ethical implications. The author takes photojournalism and, in particular, mobile phone footage as a starting point for an exploration of the (post-human) body as evidence and sign of authenticity in the modern age of digital communications and journalism.

AB  - Owing to the advancement of mobile and wireless communication technologies, an increasing number of mobile learning studies have been conducted in recent years. In a mobile learning environment, students are able to learn indoors and outdoors with access to online resources at any time. However, whether or not new learning scenarios that combine both real-world contexts and digital-world resources are beneficial to the students has been questioned. Moreover, it is also interesting to probe whether the existing e-learning strategies are effective when situated in those mobile learning scenarios. In this study, an in-field activity on an indigenous culture course of an elementary school with a formative assessment-based learning strategy was conducted to investigate the possible negative effects of mobile learning by analyzing the students’ cognitive load and learning achievement. It is interesting to find that, without proper treatment, the performance of students using those existing online learning strategies, known to be 'effective,' might be disappointing or may even negatively affect the students’ learning achievements. Furthermore, the negative effects could be due to the heavy cognitive load caused by an improper learning design. Such findings offer good references for those who intend to design and conduct mobile learning activities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Smart cities are built upon information and communication technologies (ICTs) to enable a broad range of advanced services. Through a comprehensive literature review, this study identified four pitfalls brought by the pervasive application of ICT, including information insecurity, privacy leakage, information islands, and digital divide. Therefore, a questionnaire survey together with 27 interviews was conducted in Hong Kong to investigate how the public perceived these pitfalls within the context of mobile apps providing real-time parking information which form a major part of smart mobility. System insecurity and privacy leakage were found to arouse worries among the app-users while their awareness of protecting personal data was found to have room for improvement. Islands of real-time parking information occur as a result of the lack of collaboration among private carpark operators. Digital divide existed widely among the disadvantaged groups and the problem cannot be solved by mere provision of ICT facilities. Overall, technologies alone cannot make a city smart or smarter. It is the suitable way in which ICTs are used to serve all citizens that matters. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Clicker training is an animal training technique derived from mechanized laboratory-based studies of animal learning. However, clicker training in the real world often takes place with a human trainer in an environment that is not as well controlled as a laboratory. Attempts to empirically evaluate applied clicker training techniques using testing protocols adapted from laboratory-based studies have been largely unsuccessful in replicating the learning benefits seen in laboratory animals. One proposed explanation for these inconsistencies is that methods used in the scientific evaluation of clicker training, and methods used by trainers in the industry, are not the same. The purpose of the present study was to determine what clicker training is, why people use it, and what methods are considered best practice in the context of applied dog training. A total of 586 dog owners and dog training professionals completed an online questionnaire. The results suggest that individuals do neither restrict the definition of clicker training with training using a clicker device but also include alternative signals such as verbal markers. Overall, individuals reported that clicker training was successful but acknowledged that certain handler skills need to be mastered before a person should begin clicker training with a dog. Survey respondents also showed substantial methodological variety in how they believed clickers should ideally be used. Systematic investigation into these methodological differences, along with empirical assessment of purported benefits, is now required so that evidence-based best practice recommendations in clicker training can be developed. Closer alignment between scientists and practitioners is likely to benefit both groups and the many animals that are currently trained for companion and working roles.

AB  - Background: Given limited extant research, we assessed the use of portable, battery-powered cannabis vaporizers by adult e-cigarette users. Methods: 522 adult vapers completed an online survey. Demographics; lifetime and past-month cannabis vaporization via e-cigarettes/vape-pens; preferences for hash oil, D-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) wax, or dried buds; and cannabis vaporization beliefs and motives were examined. Demographics, age of e-cigarette onset, e-cigarette use frequency, state-level legal status of cannabis, cannabis vaping beliefs/motives, and impulsivity were examined as predictors of lifetime cannabis vaporization, past-month cannabis vaporization, and cannabis vaping frequency. Results: E-cigarette users reported lifetime (17.8%) and past-month (11.5%) cannabis vaporization. Vapers preferred hash oil (LT/PM 45.5/47.5%), THC wax (15.2/32.2%), and dried buds (39.4/35.6%). Motivations to vape cannabis included: it tastes better (39.3/37.9%), is healthier (42.9/39.7%), is easier to conceal/hide (35.7/46.6%), does not smell as strong (42.9/39.7%), is more convenient (42.9/27.6%), and produces a stronger/better high (58.1/40.7%) than smoking cannabis. Lifetime and past-month cannabis vaporization, respectively, were associated with initiating e-cigarette use at an earlier age (odds ratio (OR) = 0.09/0.88), being impulsive (OR = 2.25/3.23), having poor self-control (OR = 2.23/1.85), and vaporizing cannabis because it is easier to conceal/hide (OR = 2.45/2.48) or is more convenient than smoking cannabis (OR = 5.02/2.83). Frequency of vaping cannabis was associated with heavier e-cigarette use (ηp² = 0.10) and impulsivity (ηp2 = 0.09). Conclusions: Adult e-cigarette users are vaporizing cannabis using e-cigarettes/vape-pens. Efforts to curb cannabis vaporization may benefit from targeting impulsivity in users and regulating device features that facilitate or promote convenient, inconspicuous cannabis use.

AB  - Background: Understanding factors associated with contraceptive use post-abortion can inform clinical practices to improve contraception uptake. Materials and Methods: This prospective cohort study included adult women who completed the survey before surgical abortion at an Atlanta, Georgia clinic, with an online survey 12 weeks later. Poisson regression models assessed associations between demographic and reproductive factors and use of more effective (contraceptive pill, ring, patch, injectables, intrauterine device [IUD], implant, sterilization) versus less effective (none, condoms, withdrawal, rhythm methods) contraception at follow-up. Results: Three hundred ninety three women completed the initial survey; 180 (46%) completed follow-up. Of those completing follow-up, 109 (61%) expressed interest in initiating more effective methods in-clinic, yet only 85 (47%) reported using these methods at follow-up. Sixty-one women (34%) were not using their preferred contraceptive at follow-up; 34 (56%) of whom preferred to use IUD, implant, or sterilization. More effective contraception use was significantly associated with age over 30 (adjusted risk ratio, aRR 1.71, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.14–2.57); nulliparity (aRR 1.70, 95% CI: 1.20–2.42); use of more effective methods at most recent conception (aRR 2.56, 95% CI: 1.73–3.79); interest in more effective methods at the time of the abortion (aRR 1.55, 95% CI: 1.11–2.18); and receiving a contraceptive/prescription at the time of abortion (aRR 1.97, 95% CI: 1.37–2.81). Conclusions: Over half of women use less effective contraception 3 months post-abortion, despite a high interest in more effective contraception. Additional research is needed to understand contraceptive decision making in the context of abortion care to inform interventions to increase contraceptive uptake.

AB  - Background: Attrition is a persistent issue in online self-help programs, but limited research is available on reasons for attrition or successful methods for improving participant retention. One potential approach to understanding attrition and retention in such programs is to examine person-related variables (eg, beliefs and attitudes) that influence behavior. Theoretical models, such as the Theory of Planned Behavior, that describe conditions influencing human behavior may provide a useful framework for predicting participant retention in online-based program. Objective: We examined predictors of participant retention in a guided online anxiety, depression, and stress self-help program for university students using the theory of planned behavior. We also explored whether age, symptom severity, and type of coaching (ie, email vs phone) affected participant retention. Methods: 65 university students with mild to moderate depression, anxiety, and stress were enrolled in this prospective cohort study. Participants completed a questionnaire based on the theory of planned behavior prior to commencing the online-based program and the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) during the assessment module of the program. Participant retention was operationalized as the number of program modules completed. Results: Perceived control over completing the online program significantly predicted intention to complete the program (F3,62 = 6.7; P = .001; adjusted R²=.2; standardized beta = .436, P = .001). Age (standardized beta = .319, P = .03) and perceived behavioral control (standardized beta = .295, P = .05) predicted the number of program modules completed (F3,61 = 3.20, P = .03, adjusted R₂ = .11). Initial level of distress (ie, symptom severity) did not predict participant retention (P = .55). Participants who chose phone-based coaching completed more program modules than participants who chose email-based coaching (Mann-Whitney’s U = 137; P = .004). Conclusions: Participants’ age, level of perceived behavioral control, and choice of interaction (ie, phone-based or email-based coaching) were found to influence retention in this online-based program.

AB  - To compare the effectiveness of different prenotification and invitation procedures in a web-based three-wave access panel survey over 3 consecutive months, we experimentally varied the contact mode in a fully crossed two-factorial design with (a) three different prenotification conditions (mobile short messaging service [SMS], e-mail, no prenotice) and (b) two "invitation and reminder" conditions (SMS, e-mail). A group with nearly complete mobile phone coverage was randomly assigned to one of these six experimental conditions. As expected, SMS prenotifications outperformed e-mail prenotifications in terms of response rates across all three waves. Furthermore, e-mail invitation response rates outperformed those for SMS invitations. The combination of SMS prenotification and e-mail invitation performed best. The different experimental treatments did not have an effect on the sample composition of respondents between groups.

AB  - In the information age, where all answers are just a click away, curiosity, the intrinsic drive to learn, becomes of paramount importance. How easy is it to prime for curiosity and what are its effects? What simple interventions can be used to enable curiosity-driven behaviors? We have conducted a large-scale study to address these questions, using a novel curiosity-based application (app) on university applicants. Using the same app, we addressed the issue of curiosity assessment, which in recent years has mainly been performed via self-reporting questionnaires. The curiosity assessment tool was developed in order to assess curiosity via an objective, quantitative and digital way. The tool measured several behavioral aspects during a free and task-less interaction with the tablet app. From the recorded activity logs we calculated quantitative behavioral measures related to their exploration patterns. We show that a single word can prime the participants and induce better learning of their self-explored knowledge. We also show that by simply enabling more time to explore, without the ability to stop at will, induces more exploration and more learning. Finally, we show that our behavioral measures, obtained with the digital quantitative assessment tool, are significant predictors of the participants’ self-reported curiosity and Psychometric Entrance Test scores. These results suggest that simple priming for curiosity and enabling enough time to explore improve self-paced learning, and that a relatively simple and short interaction with a digital app can greatly improve state-of-the-art curiosity assessment.

AB  - Aim: To examine whether the presence of a mobile phone has a moderating role in the relationship between nurses’ private life telepressure and workplace cognitive failure. Design: Cross‐sectional quantitative study using self‐report questionnaires. Methods: Data were collected between December 2019—January 2020. In total, 849 Registered Nurses from three Belgian hospitals completed the online survey. Data were analysed with hierarchical regression analyses and simple slope tests. Results: Overall, the positive relationship between private life telepressure and workplace cognitive failure was moderated by mobile phone presence. Specifically, the experience of private life telepressure did only relate to higher workplace cognitive failure when nurses kept their mobile phone nearby (i.e. in their pockets). Additional exploratory analyses revealed that this moderation effect only held among nurses in young adulthood and regardless of the notification settings of their mobile phone. Conclusions: The present findings indicate the unintended risk of mobile phone presence at work as it relates to higher workplace cognitive failure in nurses who experience private life telepressure. Ensuring there are clear organizational policies and practises in place to store away personal belongings of healthcare personnel during work hours would therefore seem beneficial for hospitals. Impact: Considering the increased presence of mobile phones nowadays, a more detailed understanding is necessary on how these devices might distract personnel in a healthcare setting. The present study gives further insight into this topic and shows that in particular nurses in young adulthood who experience telepressure towards personal messages report more cognitive failure when their personal mobile phones are present, even when they do not actually use these devices. This furnishes additional evidence in support of hospitals' formal policy to forbid personal mobile phones of healthcare personnel when at work.

AB  - Background: Mobile phones are ubiquitous in everyday life. Scientific studies on the problematic use of mobile phones have given initial indications of negative consequences, such as increased depression and anxiety rates and reduced sleep quality. The Problematic Use of Mobile Phone (PUMP) scale is a well evaluated, 20-item questionnaire, but a German version of the scale is still lacking. Method: An online sample (n = 723, age 27.8 ± 11.2 years, 25.2% men) completed a German translation of the PUMP scale (PUMP-D). We conducted standard item analyses and calculated internal consistency and retest reliability. An exploratory (EFA) and a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were conducted using a random split of the sample, and correlations with the self-estimated time of mobile phone usage and a global self-rating of patterns of problematic use were computed. Additionally, a second sample (n = 256, age 25.0 ± 8.8 years, 34.0% men) completed the paper version of the PUMP-D scale twice to determine the 14-day retest reliability. Results: The item-total correlations ranged from r = 0.35 (p < 0.001) to r = 0.75 (p < .001). The internal consistency was α = 0.90. The self-estimated time of usage correlated with the total value of the PUMP-D scale at r = 0.50 (p < .001). The EFA resulted in a single factor, which explained 36% of the variance. The CFA of the showed a moderate fit. The two-week retest reliability in the second sample was r tt = 0.87 (p < .001). Discussion: The German translation of the PUMP-D demonstrated a single factor structure, good psychometric properties and can be used in further research.

AB  - In recent years, the new media have become so attractive that they are used for meetings, entertainment, and work. People more and more often use Facebook or phones instead of doing their work or family duties. The main aim of the present study was to test the mediating role of future anxiety in the relationship between procrastination and problematic new media use. The participants were students (N = 478), aged 18 to 27 (M = 19.93, SD = 1.77); 64% of the sample were women. The General Procrastination Scale, the Decisional Procrastination Scale, the Facebook Intrusion Questionnaire, the Adapted Mobile Phone Use Habits, and the Future Anxiety Scale—Short Form were used. The study showed that those students who procrastinated often reported a high tendency to engage in problematic new media use and a high level of future anxiety. The findings of the study have important implications for research on problematic Facebook and mobile phone use. They may be applicable in the work of psychologists, psychiatrists, and therapists, both in prevention and in developing online addiction therapies.

AB  - Changes in technology, economy, and demography have generated today’s mobile and flexible workplace. These aspects, while leading to more permeable boundaries, render it more difficult to manage the boundaries between life domains. We conducted a quasiexperimental study to evaluate the effects of an intervention teaching mindfulness as a cognitive–emotional segmentation strategy to promote well-being. In all, 191 employees participated in the 3-week online self-training intervention and completed the preintervention– postintervention and follow-up questionnaires. As expected, the experimental group participants compared to the control group participants experienced significantly less emotional exhaustion and negative affect, and significantly more life satisfaction. Moreover, we could show that boundary management competency can be improved with an online-based self-training intervention. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)
AB  - Veränderungen in Technik, Wirtschaft und Demographie haben zu der heutigen mobilen und flexiblen Arbeitswelt beigetragen. Durch diese Entwicklungen verschwimmen die Grenzen zwischen den Lebensbereichen und erschweren die Abgrenzung der Lebensbereiche. Die vorliegende Studie evaluiert die Auswirkungen einer Boundary Management Intervention, die durch die Vermittlung von Achtsamkeit als kognitiv-emotionale Segmentationsstrategie die Abgrenzung der Lebensbereiche und das Wohlbefinden fördern will. Zu diesem Zwecke wurde eine dreiwöchige onlinebasierte Selbstcoaching Intervention entwickelt und durchgeführt. 191 Arbeitnehmende beantworteten die Pre-Post und Follow Up Fragebögen. Die Intervention bestand aus drei Modulen, welche sich jeweils aus einem theoretischen und einem praktischen Teil zusammensetzten. Im ersten Modul lag der Fokus auf der Reflexion der eigenen Abgrenzung der Lebensbereiche sowie der Bedeutung von ‚Abschalten können’ für Erholung und Wohlbefinden. Die Inhalte des zweiten und dritten Moduls basierten auf den zwei Komponenten des Achtsamkeitsmodells von Bishop et al. (2004). Das zweite Modul vermittelte den Interventionsteilnehmenden, inwiefern Achtsamkeit als Selbstregulationsstrategie genutzt werden kann, um Grenzen zwischen Lebensbereichen zu gestalten und im ‚Hier und Jetzt’ zu sein. Im dritten Modul wurde das Konzept der Achtsamkeit vertieft. In den Modulen zwei und drei lernten die Teilnehmenden verschiedene ‚achtsame’ Atemübungen, die sie nutzen können, um Achtsamkeit als kognitiv-emotionale Segmentationsstrategie in ihren Alltag zu integrieren. Mittels eines randomisierten Warte-Kontroll-Gruppen-Designs wurden die Effekte der Intervention überprüft. Wie erwartet berichteten die Teilnehmenden der Experimentalgruppe im Vergleich mit der Kontrollgruppe nach der Intervention ein höheres Maß an selbst eingeschätztem ‚Boundary Management’ (Fähigkeit, Grenzen zwischen Lebensbereichen zu ziehen), ein geringeres Maß an emotionaler Erschöpfung und negativem Affekt und ein höheres Maß an Lebenszufriedenheit. Zwei Wochen später zeigten die Teilnehmenden der Experimentalgruppe noch immer ein höheres Maß an Boundary Management und ein geringeres Maß an emotionaler Erschöpfung im Vergleich zur Kontrollgruppe. Außerdem konnte gezeigt werden, dass die Boundary Management Kompetenz durch ein onlinebasiertes Selbstcoaching gefördert werden kann. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Industrial equipment such as ruggedized handheld computers, scanners, and label printers used within asset tracking environments are expensive to purchase and costly to repair. For organizations that use this equipment, there is value in understanding when and why damage occurs and how much of those costs are potentially associated with the employees’ own sense of psychological ownership and organizational pride. Given the connection between psychological ownership and pride, the purpose of this study was to analyze employee surveys to determine what methods, tools, or programs could reduce repair and replacement while developing a stronger sense of ownership for ruggedized devices used in material‐handling industries by shift workers. Unstructured interviews about device repair with management from a large industrial company were utilized to create a multiple‐choice, anonymous online survey (n = 353). Of the six interventions proposed, assigning the same device to the same employee every shift appeared to have the most consistent and positive response. Destruction rates and costs should be posted for employee viewing and managers of workgroups with consistently high destruction rates should receive additional training. An incentive‐based program for employees responsible for the least amount of device damage as well as an individual‐assignment of devices to employees may be considered. Applications for this student include providing a tool with which organizations can use to gauge employee ownership of equipment as well as to identify interventions that may aid in mitigating expenses associated with industrially rugged equipment.

AB  - Background: Sleep is vital for adolescent functioning. Those with optimal sleep duration have shown improved capacity to learn and decreased rate of motor vehicle accidents. This study explored the influence of numerous protective and risk factors on adolescents' school night sleep (bedtime, sleep latency, total sleep time) simultaneously to assess the importance of each one and compare within three countries. Method: Online survey data were collected from Australia, Canada, and The Netherlands. Overall, 325 (137 male), 193 (28 male), and 150 (55 male) contributed to data from Australia, Canada, and The Netherlands, respectively (age range 12–19 years). Results: Regression analyses showed mixed results, when comparing protective and risk factors for sleep parameters within different countries, with combined behavioural factors contributing to small to large shared portions of variance in each regression (9–50%). One consistent finding between countries was found, with increased pre-sleep cognitive emotional sleep hygiene related to decreased sleep latency (beta = −0.25 to −0.33, p < 0.05). Technology use (mobile phone/Internet stop time) was associated with later bedtime, or less total sleep, with the strength of association varying between device and country. Conclusion: Results indicate that when designing interventions for adolescent sleep, multiple lifestyle factors need to be considered, whereas country of residence may play a lesser role.

AB  - Previous studies have documented that psychological distress is related to problematic mobile phone use (PMPU), and sporadic research has investigated the potential mechanisms underlying the association. Based on the cognitive-behavioral model of pathological Internet use (PIU), the self-control theory, and the problem-behavior theory, this study aimed to examine the mediating role of maladaptive cognitions toward mobile phones and the moderating role of effortful control between psychological distress and PMPU. Data were collected from 1,799 secondary school students (45.1% male; Mage = 14.07, SD = 1.69) using four self-reported questionnaires. The results revealed that maladaptive cognitions toward mobile phones partially mediated the relationship between psychological distress and PMPU. In addition, effortful control as a protective factor attenuated the indirect effect from psychological distress to PMPU. These findings advanced the understanding of the etiology of PMPU and the need to develop effective strategies for prevention, suggesting that schools and families should pay additional attention to students with psychological distress. Targeted interventions for integrating online and offline worlds and effortful control training programs may help to prevent adolescents from engaging in PMPU.

AB  - Although text messaging while driving is illegal in Spain previous research has shown that a substantial proportion of drivers, particularly young drivers, engage in this risky behaviour. The present study set out to investigate the psychological predictors of this behaviour using the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). This study also measured the drivers’ perceptions regarding the effectiveness of the ban on mobile phone use while driving, their perceived crash risk, the risk of being fined and the drivers perceived ability to compensate for the distraction caused by reading or writing text messages while driving. Data were collected using an online questionnaire from 1082 university students who were drivers and owned a mobile phone. Attitude and perceived behavioural control significantly predicted the intention to send and read text messages while driving, even after controlling for exposure and demographic variables. Furthermore, intention was found to be a significant predictor of retrospective measures of both sending and reading text messages while driving, as was perceived behavioural control for several of the outcome measures. The present findings provide support for the TPB and also demonstrate the additional contributions that the mobile phone ban and perceived ability to compensate for the distraction had in predicting intentions. In addition, perceived crash risk was positively related to the prediction of intentions to send text messages and the number of messages read in the last week. The implications of these findings are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)
