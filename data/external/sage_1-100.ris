N2  - With the growing popularity of smartphones and tablet PCs (tablets) equipped with mobile browsers, the possibilities to administer surveys via mobile devices have expanded. To investigate the possible mode effect on answer behavior, results are compared between a mobile device?assisted web survey and a computer-assisted web survey. First, a premeasurement in the CentERpanel is conducted to analyze the user group of mobile devices. Second, the users are randomly allocated one of the three conditions: (1) conventional computer-assisted web survey, (2) hybrid version: a computer-assisted web survey with a layout similar to mobile web survey, and (3) mobile web survey. Special attention is given to the design of the mobile web questionnaire, taking small screen size, and typical functionalities for touchscreens into account. The findings suggest that survey completion on mobile devices need not lead to different results than on computers, but one should be prepared for a lower response rate and longer survey completion time. Further, the study offers considerations for researchers on survey satisfaction, location during survey completion, and preferred device to access Internet. With adaptations, surveys can be conducted on the newest mobile devices, although new challenges are emerging and further research is called for.

N2  - This article reports from a pilot study that was conducted in a probability-based online panel in the Netherlands. Two parallel surveys were conducted: one in the traditional questionnaire layout of the panel and the other optimized for mobile completion with new software that uses a responsive design (optimizes the layout for the device chosen). The latter questionnaire was optimized for mobile completion, and respondents could choose whether they wanted to complete the survey on their mobile phone or on a regular desktop. Results show that a substantive number of respondents (57%) used their mobile phone for survey completion. No differences were found between mobile and desktop users with regard to break offs, item nonresponse, time to complete the survey, or response effects such as length of answers to an open-ended question and the number of responses in a check-all-that-apply question. A considerable number of respondents gave permission to record their GPS coordinates, which are helpful in defining where the survey was taken. Income, household size, and household composition were found to predict mobile completion. In addition, younger respondents, who typically form a hard-to-reach group, show higher mobile completion rates.

N2  - This article investigates unintended mobile access to surveys in online, probability-based panels. We find that spontaneous tablet usage is drastically increasing in web surveys, while smartphone usage remains low. Further, we analyze the bias of respondent profiles using smartphones and tablets compared to those using computers, on the basis of several sociodemographic characteristics. Our results indicate not only that mobile web respondents differ from PC users but also that tablet users differ from smartphone users. While tablets are used for survey completion by working (young) adults, smartphones are used merely by the young. In addition, our results indicate that mobile web respondents are more progressive and describe themselves more often as pioneers or forerunners in adopting new technology, compared to PC respondents. We further discover that respondents? preferences for devices to complete surveys are clearly in line with unintended mobile response. Finally, we present a similar analysis on intended mobile response in an experiment where smartphone users were requested to complete a mobile survey. Based on these findings, testing on tablets is strongly recommended in online surveys. If the goal is to reach young respondents, enabling surveys via smartphones should be considered.

N2  - With nearly 50% of U.S. mobile phone subscribers using smartphones, survey researchers are beginning to explore their use as a data collection tool. The Got Healthy Apps Study (GHAS) conducted a randomized experiment to compare mode effects for a survey completed via iPhone mobile browser and online via desktop/laptop computer web browser. Mode effects were assessed for three types of outcomes: randomization/recruitment, survey process/completion, and survey items. In short, the distribution of survey completion times and the distribution of the number of apps owned were significantly different across survey mode after accounting for block group. Other key mode effects outcomes (including open-ended items, slider bar questions, and missing item rates) showed no significant differences across survey mode. Some interesting qualitative findings suggest that iPhone respondents enter more characters and omit fewer items than originally thought.

N2  - The number of respondents who access web surveys on a mobile device (smartphone or tablet) has been increasing rapidly over the last few years. Compared with desktop computers, mobile devices have smaller screens, different input options, and are used in a larger variety of locations and situations. The suspicion that the quality of data may suffer when online respondents use mobile devices has stimulated a growing body of research, which has mainly focused on paradata and web survey design. To investigate whether the respondents? device affects the quality of web survey data, we examined the responses of 1,826 mobile-device and desktop participants in a political online survey that asked questions about the 2013 German federal election. To determine the reliability and validity of data submitted via mobile devices, we determined the consistency of the participants? responses across questions and validated the responses against various internal and external criteria. Replicating previous findings, mobile-device respondents were younger and more likely to be female, and they produced higher dropout rates and longer completion times than desktop respondents. However, data produced by respondents using mobile devices were as consistent, reliable, and valid as data produced by respondents using desktop computers. These findings contradict the notion that mobile-device users compromise the reliability and validity of data collected online and suggest that researchers do not necessarily need to be afraid of the participation of mobile-device respondents in web surveys.

N2  - Due to a rising mobile device penetration, Web surveys are increasingly accessed and completed on smartphones or tablets instead of desktop computers or laptops. Mobile Web surveys are also gaining popularity as an alternative self-administered data collection mode among survey researchers. We conducted a methodological experiment among iPhone owners and compared the participation and response behavior of three groups of respondents: iPhone owners who started and completed our survey on a desktop or laptop PC, iPhone owners who self-selected to complete the survey on an iPhone, and iPhone owners who started on a PC but were requested to switch to iPhone. We found that respondents who completed the survey on a PC were more likely to be male, to have a lower educational level, and to have more experience with Web surveys than mobile Web respondents, regardless of whether they used the iPhone voluntarily or were asked to switch from a PC to an iPhone. Overall, iPhone respondents had more missing data and took longer to complete the survey than respondents who answered the questions on a PC, but they also showed less straightlining behavior. There are only minimal device differences on survey answers obtained from PCs and iPhones.

N2  - This study explores some features of slider bars in the context of a multi-device web survey. Using data collected among the students of the University of Trento in 2015 and 2016 by means of two web surveys (N = 6,343 and 4,124) including two experiments, we investigated the effect of the initial position of the handle and the presence of numeric labels on answers provided using slider bars. It emerged that the initial position of the handle affected answers and that the number of rounded scores increased with numeric feedback. Smartphone respondents appeared more sensitive to the initial position of the handle but also less affected by the presence of numeric labels resulting in a lower tendency to rounding. Yet, outcomes on anchoring were inconclusive. Overall, no relevant differences have been detected between tablet and PC respondents. Understanding to what extent interactive and engaging tools such as slider bars can be successfully employed in multi-device surveys without affecting data quality is a key challenge for those who want to exploit the potential of web-based and multi-device data collection without undermining the quality of measurement.

N2  - Mobile coverage recently has reached an all-time high, and in most countries, high-speed Internet connections are widely available. Due to technological development, smartphones and tablets have become increasingly popular. Accordingly, we have observed an increasing use of mobile devices to complete web surveys and, hence, survey methodologists have shifted their attention to the challenges that stem from this development. The present study investigated whether the growing use of smartphones has decreased how systematically this choice of device varies between groups of respondents (i.e., how selective smartphone usage for completing web surveys is). We collected a data set of 18,520 respondents from 18 web surveys that were fielded in Germany between 2012 and 2016. Based on these data, we show that while the use of smartphones to complete web surveys has considerably increased over time, selectivity with respect to using this device has remained stable.

N2  - This article explores how mobile phones function as an affective technology for young adults, by adapting the self-expansion model to understand attachment to mobile phones. In an online survey, 272 smart phone users reported on their recalled responses to loss/separation from their mobile phone (not by choice), as well as their use of the mobile phone for self-expansion. Results show that self-expansion via mobile phone was associated with greater inclusion of the mobile phone in the self-concept and greater subjective well-being. Most respondents reported negative feelings, such as loneliness/disconnection, anxiety, and boredom, when without their mobile phone, but others felt relieved to be out of touch with others. The use of the mobile phone for self-expansion was associated with more negative emotion and less positive emotion (relief) in response to loss/separation from the phone. Interpretations of the findings are discussed.

N2  - Self-administered surveys can be conducted on mobile web-capable devices, yet these devices have unique features that can affect response processes. Ninety-two adults were randomly selected and provided with mobile devices to complete weekly web surveys. Experiments were designed to address three main objectives. First, the authors test fundamental findings which have been found robust across other modes, but whose impact may be diminished in mobile web surveys (due largely to the device), by manipulating question order and scale frequencies. Second, the authors test findings from experiments in computer-administered web surveys, altering the presentation of images and the number of questions per page. Third, the authors experiment with the unique display, navigation, and input methods, through the need to scroll, the vertical versus horizontal orientation of scales, and the willingness to provide open-ended responses. Although most findings from other modes are upheld, the small screen and keyboard introduce undesirable differences in responses.

N2  - Web survey respondents are frequently distracted during survey completion, which potentially affects the quality of data they provide. This article reports on results from a laboratory experiment examining how distractions during web survey completion influence data quality. Participants were randomly assigned to experimental groups using a 2 (device type) ? 3 (form of distraction) between-subject factorial design. They were asked to complete a web questionnaire on either a PC or a tablet and were allocated to one of the three distraction conditions: (1) the presence of other people in the room who have a loud conversation, (2) the presence of music, or (3) no distraction. The study examines the effect of distraction on various measures of data quality and attentiveness. While participants felt significantly more distracted in the presence of other people or music, the study found no significant effect of distraction for any of the data quality and attentiveness measures. The findings are encouraging for survey practitioners: Even if web respondents listen to music or are in noisy environments, these forms of distraction generally do not seem to affect the quality of responses they provide.

N2  - Question grids are common on Web surveys, and studies show that grids can affect how respondents complete surveys. However, there is little research that investigates the effects of grids on Web surveys completed on mobile devices. In this article, we evaluate the effects of question grids on response quality and measurement error for surveys taken on phones or tablets. Our study draws on a probabilistic Web survey. The survey included an experiment in which respondents were assigned to one of three question format conditions: one large grid, two small grids, or single item per page. We analyze how question grids affect response times and nondifferentiation as well as explore the interaction effects between grids and devices. Reductions in time associated with question grids were greater for surveys completed on mobile devices as opposed to those completed on computers. Likewise, the increases in nondifferentiation associated with question grids were greater for surveys completed on mobile devices. We find that effects of question grids on responses in Web surveys can differ across devices, and so researchers should be cautious of using grids on Web surveys as more people opt to do surveys on phones or tablets.

N2  - To compare the effectiveness of different prenotification and invitation procedures in a web-based three-wave access panel survey over 3 consecutive months, we experimentally varied the contact mode in a fully crossed two-factorial design with (a) three different prenotification conditions (mobile short messaging service [SMS], e-mail, no prenotice) and (b) two ?invitation and reminder? conditions (SMS, e-mail). A group with nearly complete mobile phone coverage was randomly assigned to one of these six experimental conditions. As expected, SMS prenotifications outperformed e-mail prenotifications in terms of response rates across all three waves. Furthermore, e-mail invitation response rates outperformed those for SMS invitations. The combination of SMS prenotification and e-mail invitation performed best. The different experimental treatments did not have an effect on the sample composition of respondents between groups.

N2  - The dramatic rise of smartphones has profound implications for survey research. Namely, can smartphones become a viable and comparable device for self-administered surveys? The current study is based on approximately 1,500 online U.S. panelists who were smartphone users and who were randomly assigned to the mobile app or online computer mode of a survey. Within the survey, we embedded several experiments that had been previously tested in other modes (mail, PC web, mobile web). First, we test whether responses in the mobile app survey are sensitive to particular experimental manipulations as they are in other modes. Second, we test whether responses collected in the mobile app survey are similar to those collected in the online computer survey. Our mobile survey experiments show that mobile survey responses are sensitive to the presentation of frequency scales and the size of open-ended text boxes, as are responses in other survey modes. Examining responses across modes, we find very limited evidence for mode effects between mobile app and PC web survey administrations. This may open the possibility for multimode (mobile and online computer) surveys, assuming that certain survey design recommendations for mobile surveys are used consistently in both modes.

Responses to different types of probes (explanation, elaboration and category selection probes) were examined in terms of length and quality, measured by number of characters, number of themes, and an indicator for response quality. The research messenger layout, regardless of device being used, had a negative effect on both response length, number of themes and response quality. Further, we found that in both the traditional and research messenger layout, using a mobile device negatively affects the number of characters and themes used in probed responses. We conclude that probing is most effective when a traditional survey is completed on a computer. The research messenger layout was not able to generate responses of similar quality compared to the traditional layout, regardless of device being used.

N2  - Respondents in an Internet panel survey can often choose which device they use to complete questionnaires: a traditional PC, laptop, tablet computer, or a smartphone. Because all these devices have different screen sizes and modes of data entry, measurement errors may differ between devices. Using data from the Dutch Longitudinal Internet Study for the Social sciences panel, we evaluate which devices respondents use over time. We study the measurement error associated with each device and show that measurement errors are larger on tablets and smartphone than on PCs. To gain insight into the causes of these differences, we study changes in measurement error over time, associated with a switch of devices over two consecutive waves of the panel. We show that within individuals, measurement errors do not change with a switch in device. Therefore, we conclude that the higher measurement error in tablets and smartphones is associated with self-selection of the sample into using a particular device.

N2  - While grids or matrix questions are a widely used format in PC web surveys, there is no agreement on the format in mobile web surveys. We conducted a two-wave experiment in an opt in panel in Russia, varying the question format (grid format and item-by-item format) and device respondents used for survey completion (smartphone and PC). The 1,678 respondents completed the survey in the assigned conditions in the first wave and 1,079 in the second wave. Overall, we found somewhat higher measurement error in the grid format in both mobile and PC web conditions. We found almost no significant effect of the question format on test?retest correlations between the latent scores in two waves and no differences in breakoff rates between the question formats. The multigroup comparison showed some measurement equivalence between the question formats. However, the difference varied depending on the length of a scale with a longer scale producing some differences in the measurement equivalence between the conditions. The levels of straightlining were higher in the grid than in the item-by-item format. In addition, concurrent validity was lower in the grid format in both PC and mobile web conditions. Finally, subjective indicators of respondent burden showed that the grid format increased reported technical difficulties and decreased subjective evaluation of the survey.

N2  - The considerable growth in the number of smart mobile devices with a fast Internet connection provides new challenges for survey researchers. In this article, I compare the data quality between two survey modes: self-administered web surveys conducted via personal computer and those conducted via mobile phones. Data quality is compared based on five indicators: (a) completion rates, (b) response order effects, (c) social desirability, (d) non-substantive responses, and (e) length of open answers. I hypothesized that mobile web surveys would result in lower completion rates, stronger response order effects, and less elaborate answers to open-ended questions. No difference was expected in the level of reporting in sensitive items and in the rate of non-substantive responses. To test the assumptions, an experiment with two survey modes was conducted using a volunteer online access panel in Russia. As expected, mobile web was associated with a lower completion rate, shorter length of open answers, and similar level of socially undesirable and non-substantive responses. However, no stronger primacy effects in mobile web survey mode were found.

N2  - While the choice of matrix versus item-by-item questions has received considerable attention in the literature, it is still unclear in what situation one is better than the other. Building upon the previous findings, this study expands this line of research by examining whether the difference between the two question types is moderated by the number of response options. Through a web survey experiment, this study compares matrix and item-by-item questions with 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, and 11 response options. Additionally, we also investigate the impact of the device used to complete the survey on data quality. The results show that straight lining and response time are similar between the two question types across all response lengths, but item nonresponse tends to be higher for matrix than item-by-item question, especially among mobile respondents. Also measurement models reveal measurement equivalence between the two question types when there are fewer than seven response options. For matrices with 9 or 11 response options, analyses reveal substantial differences compared to item-by-item questions.

N2  - This article discusses the relationship between theories of photography and mobile phone footage. In doing so, it asks if theories of photography still apply in a technologically saturated world of imagery. Technology is an increasingly important part of viewing imagery today and enables imagery to become part of a global cultural flow, thus calling into question the physical connection between viewer and image. This article analyses what happens to that connection when not only the image but also the physical body is mediated and challenged in post-human relations, and examines the ensuing ethical implications. The author takes photojournalism and, in particular, mobile phone footage as a starting point for an exploration of the (post-human) body as evidence and sign of authenticity in the modern age of digital communications and journalism.

N2  - This article explores the integration of the mobile phone into the religious experience of Christians in Nigeria. Based on the results of an online survey and the author?s observation, it argues that the mobile phone has become an actant in the mediatization of religion, creating dependency among some users and transforming religious praxis in palpable ways. Unsurprisingly, perspectives vary on whether and how the phone should be used during worship. Attitudes coalesce around three viewpoints, leading to the emergence of user groups labelled critics, advocates, and dualists. The accounts of study participants give access into the ways some people seek to (re)configure their engagement with religion by inserting the mobile phone as a multifunctional techno-spiritual gadget.

N2  - In recent decades changes in social connectivity have become key features in the changing contexts of later life. Communities of propinquity no longer seem to be as determining of social relationships as they once were. Mobile cell phone technology and the Internet have redefined what it means to ?keep in touch?. Some authors have argued that these new forms of connectivity have created a ?digital divide? between those who have become active adopters of these technologies and those who have not. Using data from the British General Household Survey (GHS), we examined trends in mobile phone ownership amongst people over fifty during the period 2000 - 2009. Compared with the pace of change in ownership of other household technologies such as personal computers, dishwashers, fridge freezers and microwave ovens, the take up of mobile phones amongst those aged 50 and over has followed a much sharper rise. Based upon these findings, we suggest a more sceptical stance towards the ICT ?generational divide? which needs more detailed interrogation. Future research should consider the possibility that the divide may be a more short lived phenomenon, as successive cohorts of people aged fifty and over are becoming active participants in individualised networked communities.

N2  - We implemented an experiment within a smartphone web survey to explore the feasibility of using voice input (VI) options. Based on device used, participants were randomly assigned to a treatment or control group. Respondents in the iPhone operating system (iOS) treatment group were asked to use the dictation button, in which the voice was translated automatically into text by the device. Respondents with Android devices were asked to use a VI button which recorded the voice and transmitted the audio file. Both control groups were asked to answer open-ended questions using standard text entry. We found that the use of VI still presents a number of challenges for respondents. Voice recording (Android) led to substantially higher nonresponse, whereas dictation (iOS) led to slightly higher nonresponse, relative to text input. However, completion time was significantly reduced using VI. Among those who provided an answer, when dictation was used, we found fewer valid answers and less information provided, whereas for voice recording, longer and more elaborated answers were obtained. Voice recording (Android) led to significantly lower survey evaluations, but not dictation (iOS).

N2  - In this article, we present a study on the data quality and the response process of mobile online surveys using an experimental design as compared to a standard computer. We used the following indicators to measure data quality and response properties: reaction time to survey invitation, break-off rate, item nonresponse, length of responses to open-ended questions and survey transmission, processing, and completion time. With regard to completion time, we also explored the significance of the place as well as the situation in which the survey was completed, the kind of Internet connection the respondents had as well as the hardware properties of the devices used to answer the online survey. Our results suggest comparable data quality and response properties in most aspects: There were no noticeable differences between computer and mobile users as regards break-off rate, item nonresponse, and length of responses to open-ended questions, nor the place where the survey was completed. However, it took respondents in the mobile group longer to complete the survey as compared to respondents answering the online survey on their computer. In terms of the completion time, there was a significant decrease in the differences between mobile devices and PCs when respondents used technically advanced mobile devices and had access to a fast Internet connection.

N2  - Little is known about the reliability and validity in web surveys, although this is crucial information to evaluate how accurate the results might be and/or to correct for measurement errors. In particular, there are few studies based on probability-based samples for web surveys, looking at web-specific response scales and considering the impact of having smartphone respondents. In this article, we start filling these gaps by estimating the measurement quality of sliders compared to radio button scales controlling for the device respondents used. We conducted therefore two multitrait?multimethod (MTMM) experiments in the Norwegian Citizen Panel (NCP), a probability-based online panel. Overall, we find that if smartphone respondents represent a nonnegligible part of the whole sample, offering the response options in form of a slider or a radio button scale leads to a quite similar measurement quality. This means that sliders could be used more often without harming the data quality. Besides, if there are no smartphone respondents, we find that sliders can also be used, but that the marker should be placed initially in the middle rather than on the left side. However, in practice, there is no need to shift from radio buttons to sliders since the quality is not highly improved by providing sliders.

N2  - Recently, the idea of ?data fusion?, that is, of combining different types of data, became quite popular because of the advances of new technologies. In particular, several studies started investigating the possibility of combining survey data with other data types in order to get a more complete or accurate picture of the reality and/or to reduce survey burden. One key element, then, is the willingness of people to share different types of data, beyond survey answers. In this article, we investigate to what extent members from an opt-in online panel in Spain are willing to share different types of information that have in general not been studied before in the literature: records of their surrounding sound (audiotracking), information from their email inbox (in different ways, sharing the email credentials, using an email plug-in or redirecting emails, partially or totally), sensorial reactions measured by a wearable device (neuroscience) and public information about them available online. We use a choice-based conjoint analysis in order to study the level of willingness depending on the incentives offered in exchange, and we present the level of willingness by gender and age groups. Overall, we find huge differences in the level of willingness across data types. Increasing the incentives, on the contrary, does not improve the willingness so much, even if there is a positive trend. Some differences are observed across gender and age groups but most of them are not statistically significant.

N2  - Online crowdwork platforms have been praised as powerful vehicles for economic development, particularly for workers traditionally excluded from the labor market. However, there has been insufficient scrutiny as to the feasibility of crowdwork as an income-source among socioeconomically deprived populations. This article examines device requirements and differential access to digital infrastructure, both of which act as potential barriers to not only basic participation but also to economic success online. Given the increasing prevalence of mobile-first and mobile-only populations, research on this topic aids in understanding the crowdwork ecosystem among differing socioeconomic sectors. Based on a survey of 606 crowd workers across the United States and India, this article uses both quantitative and qualitative data to explore whether reliance on mobile devices is detrimental for economic outcomes of crowdwork. The results point to substantial inequalities in device use and received benefits from crowdwork, within each country and between the two contexts.

Themes of continuity indicate that motivations in traditional newspaper use remain salient in mobile news: information-seeking, the pleasure of reading and powerful daily habits surrounding news use. In addition, participants? responses suggest additional situational or process gratifications from using mobile media devices, in addition to gratifications derived from content.

Parents of 22-year-old study participants were randomly assigned to one of two mixed-mode conditions: (1) web mode first followed by the offer of an interviewer-administered telephone mode; or (2) telephone mode first followed by the offer of the web mode. Comparison of responses by assigned condition on 12 measures showed one statistically significant difference. Analyses that modeled differences by completed mode and the interaction between assigned condition and completed mode found significant differences on six measures related to completed mode. None of the differences indicated that more socially desirable responses were given in interviewer-administered surveys.

N2  - Cell-phone-only (CPO) households differ along key variables from non-CPO households, creating potential coverage biases in landline-only random-digit-dialing (RDD) surveys. Researchers have attempted to correct for this by weighting their data based on demographic differences. Previous research, however, has not examined CPO coverage biases in media-use surveys?an important oversight as cell phone use is itself a media choice. This article presents a secondary analysis of Pew?s 2012 media consumption survey and concludes that demographics alone are not adequate controls for the CPO bias in media-use surveys.

N2  - Most mobile devices nowadays have a camera. Besides, posting and sharing images have been found as one of the most frequent and engaging Internet activities. However, to our knowledge, no research has explored the feasibility of asking respondents of online surveys to upload images to answer survey questions. The main goal of this article is to investigate the viability of asking respondents of an online opt-in panel to upload during a mobile web survey: First, a photo taken in the moment, and second, an image already saved on their smartphone. In addition, we want to test to what extent the Google Vision application programming interface (API), which can label images into categories, produces similar tags than a human coder. Overall, results from a survey conducted among millennials in Spain and Mexico (N = 1,614) show that more than half of the respondents uploaded an image. Of those, 77.3% and 83.4%, respectively, complied with what the question asked. Moreover, respectively, 52.4% and 65.0% of the images were similarly codified by the Google Vision API and the human coder. In addition, the API codified 1,818 images in less than 5 min, whereas the human coder spent nearly 35 hours to complete the same task.

N2  - Videos are often used in web surveys to assess attitudes. While including videos may allow researchers to test immediate reactions, there may be issues associated with displaying videos that are overlooked. In this article, we examine the effects of using video stimuli on responses in a probability-based web survey. Specifically, we evaluate the association between demographics, mobile device usage, and the ability to view videos; differences in ad recall based on whether respondents saw a video or still images of the video; whether respondents? complete viewing of videos is related to presentation order; and the data quality of follow-up questions to the videos as a function of presentation order and complete viewing. Overall, we found that respondents using mobile browsers were less likely to be able to view videos in the survey. Those who could view videos were more likely to indicate recall compared to those who viewed images, and videos that were shown later in the survey were viewed in their entirety less frequently than those shown earlier. These results directly pertain to the legitimacy of using videos in web surveys to gather data about attitudes.

N2  - Legacy news media have invested substantially in developing digital and mobile news provisioning, alongside the widespread diffusion of information and communication technologies. Amid these developments, many people have shifted the ways they access the news in everyday life, with mobile devices gaining much significance. This has shifted the roles traditionally played by newspapers, television stations, radio broadcasters and news sites, ultimately relating to their democratic functions and the diminishing effect of their business models. This article will describe and explain displacing vis-à-vis complementary effects among age cohorts. It shows how the recent uptake of mobile devices has influenced news consumption via newspapers and news sites. It investigates three research questions, each focusing age cohorts in relation to single-media use, cross-media use, and nonuse. The article presents a statistical analysis of datasets nationally representative to Sweden and the specific case of evening tabloids. The data used originate from scientific omnibus survey projects conducted annually from 1986 to 2012 at the University of Gothenburg. The findings show that the public generally engage in single-media rather than cross-media news consumption, whereas age cohorts have developed divergent forms of single-media use: (a) the 1930s and 1940s age cohort are primarily single-media users in print, (b) the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s age cohorts are computer-oriented single-media users; and (c) the 1980s and 1990s age cohorts are mainly single-media users via mobile devices, but also cross-media users of mobile devices combined with a computer. As of 2012, the uptake of mobile news and cross-media news consumption reached new records, whereas the single-media use of printed newspapers reached a new low. The integrated theoretical framework proves useful for comprehending such transforming news consumption among age cohorts, and reveals the significance for legacy news media to explore and exploit the opportunities arising from mobile devices and tablets.

N2  - Previous research shows that the direction of rating scales can influence participants? response behavior. Studies also suggest that the device used to complete online surveys might affect the susceptibility to these effects due to the different question layouts (e.g., horizontal grids vs. vertical individual questions). This article contributes to previous research by examining scale direction effects in an online multi-device survey conducted with panelists in Spain. In this experiment, respondents were randomly assigned to two groups where the scale direction was manipulated (incremental vs. decremental). Respondents completed the questionnaire using the device of their choosing (57.8% used PCs; 36.5% used smartphones; and 5.7% used tablets). The results show that scale direction influenced response distributions but did not significantly affect data quality. In addition, our findings indicate that scale direction effects were comparable across devices. Findings are discussed and implications are highlighted.

N2  - Interview duration is an important variable in web surveys because it is a direct measure of the response burden. In this article, we analyze the effects of the survey design, respondent characteristics, and the interaction between these effects on interview duration. For that purpose, we applied multilevel analysis to a data set of 21 web surveys on political attitudes and behavior. Our results showed that factors on both levels, the individual and the survey level, had effects on interview duration. However, the larger share of the variation in interview duration is explained by the characteristics of the respondents. In this respect, we illustrate the impact of mobile devices and panel recruitment on interview duration. In addition, we found important relationships between the respondents? attitudes and how a web survey is designed: Highly motivated respondents spent significantly more time answering cognitively demanding questions than less motivated respondents. When planning a survey, not only the number and formats of questions need to be taken into account but also the expected sample composition and how the participants will respond to the design of the web survey.

N2  - In contemporary life, the mobile phone is integral to digital and material placemaking practices. In this article, drawing on ethnographic analysis conducted in Perth and Melbourne (Australia) in the first months of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, we explore how this relation has been recalibrated as an effect of ?stay-at-home? restrictions. We first provide a brief overview of our methodological and interpretative approach ? drawing from postphenomenology as a useful framework for understanding the mobile?body?place relation and digital placemaking at home. Second, we consider how mobile media are ?situated? in the domestic environment. Third, through an analysis of participant narratives, we explore the concept of net locality (Gordon and de Souza e Silva (2011) through the lens of embodiment theory and suggest that the Covid-19 context has altered our experience of ?networked corporeality?. Finally, we discuss the ambiguity of digital intimacy in the decoupling of mobile media and the body as a result of a rapid increase in both screen time and time spent at home. Throughout the article, we argue that mobile media use in the home is thoroughly enmeshed in the shifting boundaries of privacy, placemaking and domestic space. We question how the placemaking functionality of mobile media, the intimate body?technology relation specific to mobile media practices and ?being-at-home? were subsequently modified by physical distancing and isolation.

N2  - Surveys completed on mobile web devices (smartphones) have been found to take longer than surveys completed on a PC. This has been found both in surveys where respondents can choose which device they use and in surveys where respondents are randomly assigned to devices. A number of potential explanations have been offered for these findings, including (1) slower transmission over cellular or Wi-Fi networks, (2) the difficulty of reading questions and selecting responses on a small device, and (3) the increased mobility of mobile web users who have more distractions while answering web surveys. In a secondary analysis of student surveys, we find that only about one-fifth of the time difference can be accounted for by transmission time (between-page time) with the balance being within-page time differences. Using multilevel models, we explore possible page-level (question-level) and respondent-level factors that may contribute to the time difference. We find that much of the time difference can be accounted for by the additional scrolling required on mobile devices, especially for grid questions.

N2  - Access to the medical literature has not kept pace with the mobile revolution. We aimed to (1) gauge interest in a smartphone-optimized Web site for conveniently accessing otolaryngology literature and (2) create an easy-to-access and convenient Web site that displays otolaryngology journal abstracts in a format optimized for smartphones. A survey was sent to physicians of a major US academic otolaryngology?head and neck surgery department. Demographics, literature-browsing habits, and barriers to staying updated were assessed. The response rate was 87%. Ninety-one percent of respondents used a smartphone, and 85% wished they could stay more up to date with the otolaryngology literature. Most respondents believed a convenient smartphone-optimized Web site could help them achieve this goal. A Web site was then developed in collaboration with a university creative department as a proof of concept. The site uses a simple RSS aggregator to display journal abstracts formatted for smartphone-sized screens (www.otosurg.com).

N2  - A large fuselage panel is always connected to a full-scale shape-preserving bracket to enhance its stiffness in digital assembly processes and reduce assembly deformation induced by factors such as gravity. However, the full-scale shape-preserving bracket?s characteristics, such as large size and weight, usually result in a complex installation process and high maintenance costs. A method for optimizing a multi load-transmitting device based discrete support layout is presented in this paper. By constructing finite element model including the fuselage panel and LTDs, the panel?s strain energy under different support layout parameters is obtained according to the principle of mixed uniform design. Using the method of partial least squares regression, the mathematical relationship between the strain energy and the support layout parameters is established, which is then used to obtain the optimum multi LTD based support layout. Furthermore, by comparing the panel deformation under the optimum multi LTD based support with that under the full-scale shape-preserving bracket-based support, we conclude that the optimum multi LTD based support can not only suppress panel deformation effectively, but also keep the panel?s stiffness comparable to that under the full-scale shape-preserving bracket-based support.

N2  - We examined whether emerging adults would engage in mobile phone use (MPU) when given the opportunity to socialize face-to-face with a close friend in a laboratory setting. Sixty-three U.S. college student friendship dyads rated their friendship quality in an online survey before coming into the laboratory together. When they arrived for their appointment, they were asked to wait together in a room for 5 min. A hidden camera recorded each dyad. Friends then separately rated the quality of the interaction. We coded time spent using mobile phone in seconds. A hierarchical regression conducted at the level of the dyad controlling for friendship quality and gender showed that more MPU was associated with lower quality interactions. We discuss findings in terms of the potential for MPU to interfere with the development of friendship intimacy.

This article focuses on the order-by-click scales, studying the comparability of the data obtained for this scale when answered through PCs versus smartphones. I used data from an experiment where panelists from the Netquest opt-in panel in Spain were randomly assigned to a PC, smartphone optimized, or smartphone not-optimized version of the same questionnaire in two waves. I found significant differences due to the device and optimization at least for some indicators and questions.

N2  - As use of mobile technology grows rapidly, planning agencies experiment and adopt new policies to accommodate this increase. While a significant body of literature has extolled the growth and opportunity this technological change presents, little is looking about its use by local government and urban planning organizations. This research investigates whether planning departments are capable of responding to increased mobile users given their current web and information technology tools, applying a replicable method for benchmarking website capacity. Based on a 2014 survey of planning department websites (N?=?523), this study evaluates whether or not web technology, in planning departments, is tracking growth in mobile technology finding that while 99% of planning agencies have a web presence, very few planning websites have mobile responsive frameworks. Additionally, few websites have online GIS or e-permitting capability. Of those with such capacity, many use a common content management system for data management. These findings offer key design lessons for cities that want to pursue responsive websites that better match the user profile of the trend toward accessing websites from smartphones and tablets?providing useful and timely information to citizens, and respond to changing user needs.

N2  - Information and communications technology (ICT)-based government service delivery in India is rapidly achieving a stage of maturity. With the increasing teledensity and the penetration of mobile devices, the Indian central and state governments have started to offer government services over mobile devices. As more and more government services are offered over mobile phones, it is important to gain an understanding of parameters determining the quality of mobile government services. The identification of service quality parameters will help stakeholders appropriately prioritize and position mobile-based government service delivery. This article presents the findings of an exploratory study using an online survey of Indian e-government experts on the service quality parameters for m-government in India. The study aims to identify and prioritize the service quality parameters based on similar parameters identified by researchers for e-government and mobile service quality.

N2  - The increasing use of mobile devices in the frame of online surveys has been accompanied by the development of research apps. These research apps have the potential to facilitate the process for respondents (e.g. being able to complete surveys when Internet is not available provides more freedom on when and where participants can participate) and fieldwork companies (e.g. the possibility to use push notifications could lead to higher participation rates). However, previous research suggests that panelists may also be reluctant to install an app. In this study, we answer research questions related to the knowledge and use of the Netquest app. We found that a majority of panelist did not know about the app and although sending invitations significantly increased its installation, the overall total of respondents installing the app remained low. Furthermore, the profile of those who installed the app differs from those who did not. The participation of panelists after they installed the app seems stable. The main reason for installing the app is comfort while the main reason for not installing relates to space/battery usage. Most of those who did not install could accept to install the app.

N2  - Does completing a web survey on a smartphone or tablet computer reduce the quality of the data obtained compared to completing the survey on a laptop computer? This is an important question, since a growing proportion of web surveys are done on smartphones and tablets. Several earlier studies have attempted to gauge the effects of the switch from personal computers to mobile devices on data quality. We carried out a field experiment in eight counties around the United States that compared responses obtained by smartphones, tablets, and laptop computers. We examined a range of data quality measures including completion times, rates of missing data, straightlining, and the reliability and validity of scale responses. A unique feature of our study design is that it minimized selection effects; we provided the randomly determined device on which respondents completed the survey after they agreed to take part. As a result, respondents may have been using a device (e.g., a smartphone) for the first time. However, like many of the prior studies examining mobile devices, we find few effects of the type of device on data quality.

N2  - A major concern arising from ubiquitous tracking of individuals? online activity is that algorithms may be trained to predict personal sensitive information, even for users who do not wish to reveal such information. Although previous research has shown that digital trace data can accurately predict sociodemographic characteristics, little is known about the potentials of such data to predict sensitive outcomes. Against this background, we investigate in this article whether we can accurately predict voting behavior, which is considered personal sensitive information in Germany and subject to strict privacy regulations. Using records of web browsing and mobile device usage of about 2,000 online users eligible to vote in the 2017 German federal election combined with survey data from the same individuals, we find that online activities do not predict (self-reported) voting well in this population. These findings add to the debate about users? limited control over (inaccurate) personal information flows.

N2  - Follow-up for ongoing management and monitoring of patients is important in clinical practice and research. While common, telephone follow-up is resource intensive and, in our experience, yields low success rates. Electronic communication using mobile devices including smartphones and tablets can provide efficient alternatives ? including SMS (text), online forms and mobile apps. To assess attitudes towards electronic follow-up, we surveyed 642 parents and carers at Perth Children?s Hospital, targeting demographics, device ownership and attitudes towards electronic follow-up. Mobile phone ownership was effectively universal. Almost all respondents were happy to communicate electronically with the hospital. Promisingly, 93.2% of respondents were happy to receive follow-up SMSs from the hospital and 80.3% were happy to reply to SMS questions. There was less enthusiasm regarding other modalities, with 59.9% happy to use a website and 69.0% happy to use a mobile app. The results support the introduction of electronic communication for follow-up in our paediatric population.

N2  - Mobile donation has gained mainstream media attention since the Haiti Earthquake Relief in 2010. Yet, there is still a lack of research on mobile donation as a new venue of technology-mediated civic engagement. Using nationally representative survey data, this research examines the variations in mobile donation by mobile phone usage patterns and user characteristics such as age, race, and socioeconomic status. Results show that the diversity of mobile phone use and the frequency of relational mobile communication are positively associated with mobile donation. As importantly, mobile donation helps to overcome age, race and SES gaps, giving members of disadvantaged social groups a more accessible tool for civic engagement. Internet donation and mobile donation complement rather than compete with each other.

N2  - The emergence of web technology creates tremendous opportunity to advance good government, through increased information, interaction with the public, and cost-effective, efficient means of conducting public transactions. Some have proposed that e-government tools have two major roles: (1) receptive and (2) interactive. We argue that there is a third role for planning and e-government technology ? the transactive. To evaluate this, we survey public sector planning officials on their professional use of mobile technology. Results confirm the recent trends in increased smartphone use, but indicated that only a limited amount of this increased use is for work purposes. We find that there are still planners who not only do not rely on web technologies at all, within even desktop computer access. Furthermore, our results suggest that the current use of mobile technology appears to be less transactive than the literature suggests. This finding provides room for growth in these transactive and more dynamic exchanges, especially with the increasing prevalence of mobile devices. To assist in this, we provide a taxonomy to help define how mobile technology can change planning and local governance. Such a tool can provide a roadmap for increasing transactive exchanges between local government and citizens in the future.

N2  - Researchers are combining self-reports from mobile surveys with passive data collection using sensors and apps on smartphones increasingly more often. While smartphones are commonly used in some groups of individuals, smartphone penetration is significantly lower in other groups. In addition, different operating systems (OSs) limit how mobile data can be collected passively. These limitations cause concern about coverage error in studies targeting the general population. Based on data from the Panel Study Labour Market and Social Security (PASS), an annual probability-based mixed-mode survey on the labor market and poverty in Germany, we find that smartphone ownership and ownership of smartphones with specific OSs are correlated with a number of sociodemographic and substantive variables. The use of weighting techniques based on sociodemographic information available for both owners and nonowners reduces these differences but does not eliminate them.

N2  - Self-assessment and audit in anaesthesia require a systematic approach to postoperative data collection. The increasing prevalence of mobile internet technology offers a new data collection method for anaesthetists. In this paper, a system for mobile internet data collection is described and the preliminary experience with its use is presented. The system was developed by the author and combined an open source survey application and a short message service (SMS) gateway to send SMS messages to patients after their anaesthesia and surgery. The messages requested patients to complete an online Quality of Recovery survey questionnaire if they had a smartphone. The results were immediately available. A preliminary survey of consenting patients with available mobile telephone numbers in a private practice was undertaken by the author. A total of 123 procedures were eligible for follow-up and survey requests were sent to 94 patients. Sixty-five surveys were completed. This represents 69% of surveys requested, demonstrating that mobile phone technology can be used to provide significant amounts of data for quality assurance. However, the implementation of a mobile internet data collection system requires consideration of privacy principles, security and ethical handling of data.

N2  - The number of mobile phone subscriptions worldwide reached almost 7 billion in 2013. Therefore, the social and psychological consequences of the technology are of great interest to new media scholars and policy makers. Adopting an affordance-based approach, this study examines how different uses of the mobile phone are related to individuals? subjective well-being and social capital. Findings from a national survey showed that both voice and online communication with the mobile phone is positively related to various indicators of subjective well-being and bonding and bridging capital. Moreover, both bonding and bridging capital mediated the relationship between mobile phone use and subjective well-being. On the other hand, non-communicative uses, such as information seeking activities, were negatively related to positive affect and passing time activities were positively related to negative affect. Implications of the findings are discussed.

N2  - Smartphones are ubiquitous and frequently used in copresent interactions. This behavior is often seen as inappropriate and thus has been termed phubbing, compromising the words ?phone? and ?snubbing.? Although being a worldwide phenomenon, little is known about what predicts phubbing behavior in the first place. Drawing on injunctive norms (i.e., what ought to be done), the study?s aim was to shed light on the relationship between mobile phone norms (MPN) and phubbing behavior. Furthermore, the role of being permanently online and permanently connected (POPC) and fear of missing out (FOMO), reflecting approach and avoidance orientations, respectively, as additional predictors and moderators was investigated. As expected, the findings of an online survey (N = 278) supported the assumption that MPN were negatively related to phubbing behavior. Moreover, results showed that both FOMO and POPC were significantly positively connected to phubbing behavior but did not play significant moderating roles concerning the norm?phubbing relationship.

N2  - The proportion of web survey responses submitted from mobile devices such as smartphones is increasing steadily. This trend presents new methodological challenges because mobile responses are often associated with increased breakoffs, which, in turn, can increase nonresponse bias. Using data from a survey of college students with more than 20,000 respondents, response patterns are examined to identify which days and times the survey invitation and reminder emails were most likely to produce nonmobile responses. The findings provide guidance on the optimal timing for recruiting college student sample members via email to reduce their likelihood of responding from a mobile device, and potentially, breaking off.

N2  - Background:Tobacco smoking is a significant source of morbidity in patients with a durable left ventricular assist device. While various cessation strategies have been investigated, the ability of ventricular assist device centers to implement a successful tobacco cessation program remains uncertain. We explored various cessation strategies employed by ventricular assist device centers and assessed perspectives of their effectiveness, as well as institutional investment in these programs.Methods:A 37-question online self-report survey was created using Survey Monkey? and distributed worldwide. We investigated (1) programmatic strategies utilized for smoking cessation, (2) the respondent?s perspective on the effectiveness of these strategies, (3) the structure with which these therapies are administered, and (4) overall organizational support for these treatments.Results:A total of 47 centers worldwide completed the survey. The most common methods of tobacco cessation were pharmacologic and nicotine replacement therapy (78% and 66%). However, only about half (47% and 50%, respectively) of the centers indicated that these strategies were effective. When asked whether a respondent?s center perceives that tobacco smoking should be a deciding factor in destination therapy evaluations, nearly a third (15, 32%) responded in the affirmative.Conclusion:While significant overlap exists among centers regarding treatments used for smoking cessation with left ventricular assist device patients, the most common treatments are not thought to be effective. While the current recommendations require tobacco smoking cessation in only bridge-to-transplant patients and not destination therapy patients, a number of centers disagree with the national guidelines and believe smoking should be prohibited in both populations.

N2  - In vibration experiments demanding long-duration measurements, traditional point-wise techniques are often employed, despite the availability of high-speed digital image correlation. This is due to the high volume of images generated by the latter technique, which limit acquisition times and lengthen post-processing times. In this experimental investigation, it is demonstrated that standard frame rate charge-coupled device cameras yield results for the mean deflected shape of a reinforced aerospace panel subject to a random broadband excitation between 0 and 800?Hz that are not statistically different to those from high-speed cameras. The images from both types of camera were processed using digital image correlation to generate out-of-plane displacement maps, which were then decomposed using Chebyshev descriptors for ease of comparison and to determine the mean deflected shape. The results indicate that, with appropriate sampling rates and durations, standard frame rate charge-coupled device cameras can be used to study broadband random excitation behavior of structures when mean behavior needs to be characterized over long time scales compared to the excitation wavelengths. This is contrary to accepted procedures, but offers comparable accuracy with substantially reduced computational resources compared to using high-speed cameras, as well as effectively unlimited data acquisition periods, which is useful in condition monitoring, for example.

N2  - This article compares the factors affecting completion times (CTs) to web survey questions when they are answered using two different devices: personal computers (PCs) and smartphones. Several studies have reported longer CTs when respondents use smartphones than PCs. This is a concern to survey researchers because longer CTs may increase respondent burden and the risk of breakoff. However, few studies have analyzed the specific reasons for the time difference. In this analysis, we analyzed timing data from 836 respondents who completed the same web survey twice, once using a smartphone and once using PC, as part of a randomized crossover experiment in the Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences panel. The survey contained a mix of questions (single choice, numeric entry, and text entry) that were displayed on separate pages. We included both page-level and respondent-level factors that may have contributed to the time difference between devices in cross-classified multilevel models. We found that respondents took about 1.4 times longer when using smartphones than PCs. This difference was larger when a page had more than one question or required text entry. The difference was also larger among respondents who had relatively low levels of familiarity and experience using smartphones. Respondent multitasking was associated with slower CTs, regardless of the device used. Practical implications and avenues for future research are discussed.

N2  - This study aimed to determine contact and privacy risks encountered by Malaysian adolescents with access to the Internet and mobile phones and factors associated with face-to-face meetings with online acquaintances as well as to estimate the prevalence of subsequent victimization. Secondary school students from randomly selected public schools in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur responded to an anonymous self-administered questionnaire (78% response rate). Out of 3,349 Internet or mobile phone users, 51% had been invited to meet offline with an online-meeting acquaintance and 30% complied. Of the 1,005 respondents who went to offline meetings, 55% had meetings with more than six people. Male gender, Malay ethnicity, online access at an Internet café, viewing pornography on the Internet, the absence of parental restrictions on visiting certain website and chat rooms, not being explicitly forbidden to meet strangers encountered online, and disclosure of personal information were significantly associated with increased odds of face-to-face meetings with online acquaintances. Verbal, physical, or sexual assaults were reported by 5.5% of the 1,005 including 13 males and five females who reported forced sexual intercourse. Similarities as well as differences in factors associated with risk-taking behavior compared with adolescents in Western countries have important implications on policy and intervention.

N2  - Based on data collected through the Net Children Go Mobile survey of approximately 3500 respondents aged 9?16?years in seven European countries (Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Romania and the United Kingdom), this article examines the diffusion of smartphones among children and contributes to existing research on mobile digital divides by investigating what influences the adoption of smartphones among children and whether going online from a smartphone is associated with specific usage patterns, thus bridging or widening usage gaps. The findings suggest the resilience of digital inequalities among children, showing how social inequalities intersect with divides in access and result in disparities in online activities, with children who benefit from a greater autonomy of use and a longer online experience also reaching the top of the ladder of opportunities.

N2  - This study explores the role of mobile news in democracy by examining individual-level variations in mobile election news use based on demographics, socioeconomic indicators, and mobile media activity breadth, and, in turn, how mobile news use is associated with political participation. Nationally representative data from a random-sample survey of American adults (N = 2,250) in the 2010 general election were analyzed to better explain who mobile election news users are, how they compare to nonusers, and whether mobile news use was associated with voter turnout and mobile campaign donation. Findings underscore the significance of mobile media use and mobile news as phenomena of emerging importance in the election campaigns, and important differential patterns in the relationships of sociodemographics, mobile media, and electoral participation are discussed. By providing a nuanced accounting of the socioeconomic and demographic profile of mobile election news users and how those individuals differ from nonusers, this study enriches explanations of how societal privilege and the benefits of political engagement are related in complicated ways to individual-level variations in consuming and using mobile election news. Notably, for racial minorities, mobile media may provide a bridge across the digital-driven democratic divide and a more effective means of engaging with digital election information than other ICTs. Analysis also extends what is known about how citizens use mobile news to engage with increasingly personalized election campaigns. Results indicate that mobile election news use was a significant positive predictor of the odds of having voted and whether individuals used their mobile devices to make contributions during the campaign. These findings support arguments that the unique qualities of mobile devices are contributing to new and different pathways to political engagement while also retaining significance in relation to traditional forms of offline political participation.

N2  - IntroductionClosed-system transfer devices (CSTDs) were introduced into clinical practice to protect healthcare practitioners (HCPs) from exposure to hazardous drugs. However, ambiguous guidelines have led to confusion as to when CSTD use is required, as institutes are instructed to maintain their own hazardous drug lists and determine the appropriate level of personal protective equipment for their staff. This study seeks to understand the current use of CSTDs by Canadian oncology HCPs, the influence of various stakeholders on their use and the challenges faced by HCPs surrounding the use of these medical devices.MethodsThe researchers compiled a set of questions to inform on the current use of CSTDs in clinical practice and administered an online survey to oncology HCPs across Canada.ResultsThe results indicate that though CSTD use is common in Canadian oncology practice settings, there is variation in the extent of the use of these devices across provinces and with which products these devices are used. The survey results also show that the top challenges with the use of CSTDs include cost, lack of information on the compatibility of a CSTD with a drug product, and CSTD impact on drug quality. Many respondents are aligned that regulatory bodies are more likely to influence the use of CSTDs with specific drug products than drug manufacturers.ConclusionGuidelines for the application of CSTDs in clinical practice vary and are often ambiguous. Regulatory bodies are uniquely positioned to provide healthcare institutions with more clarity on when CSTD use is appropriate.

N2  - More and more respondents are answering web surveys using mobile devices. Mobile respondents tend to provide shorter responses to open questions than PC respondents. Using voice recording to answer open-ended questions could increase data quality and help engage groups usually underrepresented in web surveys. Revilla, Couper, Bosch, and Asensio showed that in particular the use of voice recording still presents many challenges, even if it could be a promising tool. This article reports results from a follow-up experiment in which the main goals were to (1) test whether different instructions on how to use the voice recording tool reduce technical and understanding problems, and thereby reduce item nonresponse while preserving data quality and the evaluation of the tool; (2) test whether nonresponse due to context can be reduced by using a filter question, and how this affects data quality and the tool evaluation; and (3) understand which factors affect nonresponse to open-ended questions using voice recording, and if these factors also affect data quality and the evaluation of the tool. The experiment was implemented within a smartphone web survey in Spain focused on Android devices. The results suggest that different instructions did not affect nonresponse to the open questions and had little effect on data quality for those who did answer. Introducing a filter to ensure that people were in a setting that permits voice recording seems useful. Despite efforts to reduce problems, a substantial proportion of respondents are still unwilling or unable to answer open questions using voice recording.

Data were collected through a student survey (n=1090) and focus groups with students (n=21) and semi-structured interviews with faculty members (n=4) were conducted. The findings suggested that the use of Tablet PCs with collaborative software promoted various types of faculty-student (e.g. real-time feedback, active engagement) and student-student interactions (e.g., online collaboration for co-located teams, virtual meetings). Additionally, students who use Tablet PCs in more courses showed higher level of engagement in classroom interactions. Recommendations for incorporating Tablet PCs into classrooms based on the findings are discussed.

N2  - Paper has been the format of choice for disseminating geographic information for millennia; however the arrival of the internet and mobile technologies has created new modes of map consumption. This paper investigates the future role of paper mapping in a society where access to online digital mapping is freely available. The research consists of an online survey to investigate how people use and view online/digital and paper maps, together with a task-based user study to investigate the suitability of each map format for a variety of given tasks. Similar to previous research, we categorize participants into two groups (experts and non-experts/novices) based on their level of geographic skill. Results demonstrate that geographic knowledge and the context of use clearly relate to preference of map format. As geographic skill increases, there is a greater preference for paper maps; non-experts prefer online/digital maps. Also, paper is the preferred medium for planning and executing navigation on foot across all groups. Overall, results suggest that paper maps are here to stay for the foreseeable future and remain the preferred choice for some in the digital age.

N2  - AbstractEuropean microfinance suffers from a visibility deficit. It is rarely mentioned in the media. Our research question is ?Why does European microfinance suffer from a lack of visibility in the press?? This study looked at news reports and press releases over a 18-month period (2016?2018) to check if European microfinance and its innovations were in the news. The study finds that, indeed, there are a lot of new innovations in finance. But, first, in Europe, the highly talked about fintech innovations are taking place outside of microfinance institutions (MFIs). Second, the innovations that are talked about in microfinance are taking place in developing countries out of Europe. The study followed this up by examining websites of some of the leading European fintech firms to see what they were doing that made them so visible. We share some best practices in the use of digital technologies by highly innovative fintech firms in areas that could be of use to MFIs in diverse sectors such as mobile payments, credit scoring, card readers, ATMs and management information systems. To become visible, European microfinance may need to demonstrate that it is doing new things and that it is using innovative technologies that helps it reduce costs, increase outreach and, thus, have an impact. Forii such as the European Microfinance Network and the European Microfinance Platform need to promote these innovations by offering appropriate awards. Finally, collaborating with training and educational institutes may help add to visibility.

N2  - Several state prisons have provided tablets to imprisoned people which appears to be indicative of a larger trend to increase access to technology for imprisoned people. However, access to and the use of technology in prison has not been evaluated by social scientists. This study surveyed 70 prison officials from six states to report their attitudes toward access to and the use of tablets in prison for imprisoned people and for the prisons themselves. Survey results show that prison officials who work in prisons with more access to technology are more likely to believe technology to be a positive contribution for imprisoned people.

N2  - Purpose:To analyze the impact of mobile electronic devices (MEDs) and apps in the daily clinical activity of young radiation or clinical oncologists in 5 Western European countries (Italy, Germany, Spain, Portugal, and Denmark).Methods:A web-based questionnaire was sent to 462 young (≤40 years) members of the national radiation or clinical oncology associations of the countries involved in the study. The 15 items investigated diffusion of MEDs (smartphones and/or tablets), their impact on daily clinical activity, and the differences perceived by participants along time.Results:A total of 386 (83.5%) of the 462 correctly filled questionnaires were statistically evaluated. Up to 65% of respondents declared to use an electronic device during their clinical activity. Conversely, 72% considered low to moderate impact of smartphones/tables on their daily practice. The daily use significantly increased from 2009 to 2012: users reporting a use ≥6 times/d raised from 5% to 39.9%. Professional needs fulfillment was declared by less than 68% of respondents and compliance to apps indications by 66%. Significant differences were seen among the countries, in particular concerning the feeling of usefulness of MEDs in the daily clinical life. The perception of the need of a comprehensive Web site containing a variety of applications (apps) for clinical use significantly differed among countries in 2009, while it was comparable in 2012.Conclusions:This survey showed a large diffusion of MEDs in young professionals working in radiation oncology. Looking at these data, it is important to verify the consistency of information found within apps, in order to avoid potential errors eventually detrimental for patients. ?Quality assurance? criteria should be specifically developed for medical apps and a comprehensive Web site gathering all reliable applications and tools might be useful for daily clinical practice.

N2  - This study examines the response rates for surveys used in organizational research. We analysed 1607 studies published in the years 2000 and 2005 in 17 refereed academic journals, and we identified 490 different studies that utilized surveys. We examined the response rates in these studies, which covered more than 100,000 organizations and 400,000 individual respondents. The average response rate for studies that utilized data collected from individuals was 52.7 percent with a standard deviation of 20.4, while the average response rate for studies that utilized data collected from organizations was 35.7 percent with a standard deviation of 18.8. Key insights from further analysis include relative stability in response rates in the past decade and higher response rates for journals published in the USA. The use of incentives was not found to be related to response rates and, for studies of organizations, the use of reminders was associated with lower response rates. Also, electronic data collection efforts (e.g. email, phone, web) resulted in response rates as high as or higher than traditional mail methodology. We discuss a number of implications and recommendations.

N2  - This study explores mobile phone use among people experiencing homelessness in downtown Los Angeles. It explores usage patterns and connectivity challenges, and how these affect access to social services as well as opportunities for information seeking, skills building, and social capital formation. To characterize the unreliable conditions under which this population uses mobile phones, we introduce the concept of access instability to capture not simply the obstacles to technology access imposed by poverty but more broadly those stemming from a combination of poverty, housing insecurity, and discrimination. The study is primarily based on a survey among adults experiencing homelessness (or at risk of) conducted over a span of 5 months, complemented by findings from a participatory research intervention carried out in collaboration with a local advocacy organization. Among the key findings is that reliable access to electrical power represents a fundamental yet understudied barrier to mobile use among marginalized populations, including (but not limited to) those experiencing homelessness. Lacking a safe and reliable place to charge their devices, the unstably housed must activate coping strategies that limit digital engagement and constrain use. Overall, access instability disrupts the expectation of constant reachability that underpins modern economic and social relations. Ultimately, this narrows pathways out of homelessness by limiting the ability to gain or sustain employment, to connect with healthcare providers and other vital resources, and to maintain networks of personal support.

N2  - We employ a mixed-methods approach to examine the state of mobile web publishing among U.S. local newspapers. Analysis of the mobile version of news websites (N = 100) across the 50 states yields an uneven picture, with innovation lagging in key areas. A survey with local owner-operators (N = 77) in a large U.S. state suggests that devoting attention to mobile audiences may be associated with revenue opportunities, and the ability to innovate is not necessarily associated with firm size. We explore implications for the viability of local news.

In a recent national meeting, we asked our audience of pharmacists how many of them had purchased the iPhone. Only about 5% raised their hands. Since its introduction earlier in the year, we are frequently asked about the iPhone. The number 1 question we receive is whether or not the 2 of us have chosen to move to this device. Other questions focus on whether or not the iPhone is a good fit for a pharmacist. What follows is our considered opinion.

N2  - In today?s world of networked, mobile, and global digital communication, Muslim martyrdom as a multi-layered communicative practice has experienced a new type of media saturation, thereby posing a challenge for the study of media, religion, and culture in a digital age. In this article, the analysis focuses on two cases of high symbolic relevance for the events later referred to as the ?Arab Spring??the deaths of a Tunisian fruit seller Mohammed Bouazizi and a young Egyptian man Khaled Saeed. Special focus is given to the discussion of digital solidarities and their construction in circulation and remediation of martyr narratives of Bouazizi and Saeed in diverse media contexts. In this global development of digital solidarities, we identify two categories of martyr images of particular relevance?a ?living martyr? and a ?tortured martyr??and discuss their resonance with different historical, religious, cultural, and political frames of interpretation. In conclusion, we reflect on the question of the ethics of global mediation of Muslim martyrdom and its implications for the study field of media, religion, and culture in its digital state.

N2  - How do people find answers to questions they encounter in everyday life? While extensive research has examined how people go about finding answers to questions online, there has been little work investigating the issue from a more holistic, in situ perspective that covers the various devices, resources, and contextual factors that influence everyday question-asking experiences. To address this, we developed a text-messaging-based data-collection framework. This paper details our approach including reflections on both the benefits and challenges of the methodology for researchers seeking to apply similar approaches to social science research. In doing so, we demonstrate how our methodology helps establish a contextually rich understanding of information-seeking processes. We also demonstrate our approach to analyzing data from a small but diverse group of adults across the United States about their everyday question-asking experiences.

N2  - Background:Advanced technology and improved outcomes have led to rapid growth of ventricular assist devices (VADs) throughout the world, but little exists regarding their structure. We sought to study trends in VAD programs on a global level.Methods:We distributed a 26-question online survey to 321 individuals who work within those programs. Four categories of questions were formed: patient management, coordinator role, multidisciplinary support, and leadership.Results:Fifty-eight surveys (47 United States, 11 international) were analyzed. The majority of programs cared for 26 to 100 device-assisted patients (62%), 26% cared for ≤25 patients, and 12% cared for ≥100 patients. Advanced practice providers (APPs) were used in 69% of programs as a device coordinator. In-hospital rounding was performed equally among the APPs and registered nurses. Most programs used a social worker (90%), nutritionist (74%), pharmacist (72%), palliative care (66%), and finance coordinator (64%). Less than half (43%) included a case manager and only 33% used a pharmacist. The program leader was identified as a cardiologist (31%) or surgeon (26%) or both equally (43%).Conclusion:This study demonstrates differences and similarities between VAD program structures. Additional research is warranted to evaluate the effect of program structure on outcomes, job satisfaction, and retention regions.

N2  - Across two studies, we aimed to determine the row and column size in matrix-style questions that best optimizes participant experience and data quality for computer and mobile users. In Study 1 (N = 2,492), respondents completed 20 questions (comprising four short scales) presented in a matrix grid (converted to item-by-item format on mobile phones). We varied the number of rows (5, 10, or 20) and columns (3, 5, or 7) of the matrix on each page. Outcomes included both data quality (straightlining, item skip rate, and internal reliability of scales) and survey experience measures (dropout rate, rating of survey experience, and completion time). Results for row size revealed dropout rate and reported survey difficulty increased as row size increased. For column size, seven columns increased the completion time of the survey, while three columns produced lower scale reliability. There was no interaction between row and column size. The best overall size tested was a 5 ? 5 matrix. In Study 2 (N = 2,570), we tested whether the effects of row size replicated when using a single 20-item scale that crossed page breaks and found that participant survey ratings were still best in the five-row condition. These results suggest that having around five rows or potentially fewer per page, and around five columns for answer options, gives the optimal survey experience, with equal or better data quality, when using matrix-style questions in an online survey. These recommendations will help researchers gain the benefits of using matrices in their surveys with the least downsides of the format.

N2  - For a long time, a common opinion among policy-makers was that the digital divide problem would be solved when a country?s Internet connection rate reaches saturation. However, scholars of the second-level digital divide have concluded that the divides in Internet skills and type of use continue to expand even after physical access is universal. This study?based on an online survey among a representative sample of the Dutch population?indicates that the first-level digital divide remains a problem in one of the richest and most technologically advanced countries in the world. By extending basic physical access combined with material access, the study finds that a diversity in access to devices and peripherals, device-related opportunities, and the ongoing expenses required to maintain the hardware, software, and subscriptions affect existing inequalities related to Internet skills, uses, and outcomes.

N2  - Questionnaire responses were compared between high school students and teachers, all of whom participate in their school's 24/7 access tablet PC (TPC) program. Primary areas of interest were students' and teachers' experiences with and attitudes about the TPCs, physical discomfort associated with TPC use, and patterns of TPC use. Results showed students' and teachers' attitudes were generally quite positive towards the TPCs, including both groups appreciating the TPC as an organizational aid. However, neither group tended to think TPCs had improved student grades. It is important to explore the similarities and differences between people who share a classroom and much more as they proceed through a school year together. This type of assessment provides a useful complement to more common assessments of impact of digital technology on academic performance.

N2  - Mobile devices (e.g., smartphones, personal digital assistants, and tablets) are evolving rapidly and growing exponentially in multiple facets around the globe. Specifically, mobile devices can be used as audio and video chat, reference guide, training tool, handoff facilitation, and decision support. Undoubtedly, there are clear advantages of leveraging this technology including automatic updates, portable and unobtrusive access to data, and time savings for documentation allowing clinicians more time for patient care. However, innovative technology brings new yet critical obstacles to overcome (e.g., usability and security). Thus, the current panel is designed to gather leading human factors and medical experts in the fields of clinical care, system design, and human-system interaction to provide their insight and perspective on the following question: What contributions can human factors science and medical experts combine to bring to bear on the development, implementation, and evaluation of mobile-based technology?

N2  - In this article, we report on an action case study on the use of mobile-assisted peer feedback to improve second language (L2) speakers? English performance. Drawing on the learning-oriented assessment (LOA) framework (Carless, 2007), the study made in-class use of a newly developed mobile app with the provision of peer feedback. The study was conducted with 25 Business School students in an English for Specific Purposes course at a Hong Kong university. A mixed-methods approach was adopted, including a questionnaire survey, a focus group discussion after the class and a teacher journal. In addition to the participants? general attitudes, two broad themes were found in relation to the participants? learning experience, namely the use of peer feedback and the affordances and constraints of technology. Results showed that students generally agreed on the positive effects of mobile-assisted peer feedback (e.g. real-time and anonymous feedback), while they recognized some limitations such as the small screen size of their phones and the limited number of given rubrics. Finally, we discuss the implications from different perspectives based on the reported themes.

N2  - The purpose of this article is to provide evidence regarding the comparability of results provided by two survey methods?a random phone survey and a nonrandom online survey?using the derived importance?performance approach to examine service satisfaction data at the local level. Specifically, we measure whether nonprobability opt-in online survey results produce results that are convergent or divergent to random phone survey results. The findings show that the phone and online survey techniques yield divergent results when simple univariate statistical techniques are employed but produce similar results when the data are analyzed using the more advanced derived importance approach. Though preliminary, the findings suggest that recent advances in the analysis of satisfaction survey data might have the possibility to offset the methodological drawbacks of nonrandom survey techniques such as opt-in online questionnaires. Because of the cost and resource implications of the use of each survey technique, the results hold potentially important lessons for researchers and administrators interested in understanding the costs and benefits of using various survey methods to assess satisfaction with municipal services.

N2  - Many psychological processes unfold over time, necessitating longitudinal research designs. Longitudinal research poses a host of methodological challenges, foremost of which is participant attrition. Building on Dillman?s work, we provide a review of how social influence and relationship research informs retention strategies in longitudinal studies. Objective: We introduce the tailored panel management (TPM) approach, which is designed to establish communal norms that increase commitment to a longitudinal study, and this commitment, in turn, increases response rates and buffers against attrition. Specifically, we discuss practices regarding compensation, communication, consistency, and credibility that increase longer term commitment to panel participation. Research design: Throughout the article, we describe how TPM is being used in a national longitudinal study of undergraduate minority science students. TheScienceStudy is a continuing panel, which has 12 waves of data collected across 6 academic years, with response rates ranging from 70% to 92%. Although more than 90% of participants have either left or graduated from their undergraduate degree program, this highly mobile group of people remains engaged in the study. TheScienceStudy has usable longitudinal data from 96% of the original panel. Conclusion: This article combines social psychological theory, current best practice, and a detailed case study to illustrate the TPM approach to longitudinal data collection. The approach provides guidance for other longitudinal researchers, and advocates for empirical research into longitudinal research methodologies.

N2  - Background:With the pharmaceutical industry?s increased attention on enhancing patient experiences during their participation in clinical trials, the use of mobile nurse (MN) services to support the conduct of clinical trial assessments in the home (or in alternative locations other than in investigational sites) has been gaining momentum.Methods:Because no quantitative data capturing industry-wide practices are available, in July 2014, Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development and Hoffman-La Roche conducted an online survey to gather data on the prevalence and utilization of MN services in clinical trials taking into account the following factors: industry perceptions of the business model, risks barriers to adoption, vendor landscape, cost, and prospects for future growth. A total of 113 respondents answered the survey, with 53 respondents answering all questions.Results:The use of MN services in clinical trials is an established and growing business practice. Utilization of MN services has so far been most prevalent in North America, followed by Western Europe. Sponsor companies that have adopted this model have done so mainly to improve patient retention and protocol compliance, as well as improve access to rare patients. Most of the companies surveyed work directly with vendors specializing in home nurse services. Experience with vendors was considered favorable in most cases.Conclusions:Building effective partnerships with 1 to 2 vendors is considered a key factor for long-term success.

Following an exploratory sequential mixed-methods design, interviews with parents in Bogotá, Colombia, explored how they managed to keep in touch with their children despite facing access barriers and how these barriers still affected their parent?child mobile interactions. A survey was conducted in the quantitative phase to confirm the relationship patterns suggested by qualitative findings. Financial, cognitive, and environmental resources constituted access barriers. Despite gaining material access through alternative social and environmental resources, the barriers they faced still influenced the nature and frequency of their parent?child mobile interactions. Findings also showed that cognitive barriers, observed as parents? low levels of perceived capability to learn how to use mobile phones, affected parents? text messaging through their acquisition of skills.

N2  - Digital technologies have led to the emergence of new forms of flexible work, such as crowdwork or information and communication technology-enabled mobile work, over the past decade. This is considered as a positive development for its high flexibility in hours and place of work, and also for providing employment opportunities to workers in developing countries, individuals with disabilities or those with care responsibilities. This article examines the on-going trend in outsourcing low-skilled work to the crowd through online platforms, and how platform design features and algorithmic management are used by digital labour platforms to assign, monitor and evaluate work. The paper argues that these distinctive features of digital platforms have an impact on working conditions in terms of access to tasks, remuneration and working time flexibility. The paper draws on a global survey of 675 workers on five globally operating platforms in 27 developing countries. Its findings highlight the need for transparency in platform architecture, design and algorithms to ensure that workers are protected from the vulnerabilities they face with digital work.

N2  - Digital interfaces, in the form of websites, mobile apps and other platforms, now mediate user experiences with a variety of economic, cultural and political services and products. To study these digital mediations, researchers have to date followed a range of methodological strategies including the modification of pre-existing qualitative research methods, such as content analysis, discourse analysis and semiotics, among many others, and an experimentation with new methods designed to make visible the operation of data aggregation, analytics and algorithms that are hidden from users. Building upon, while distinct from these strategies, the article sets out a post-phenomenological approach to studying interfaces, websites and apps that explicitly interrogates how they appear as objects. In doing so, the article provides a response to a problem that animates contemporary cultural geography: that new cultural objects are emerging which place in question the habits and practices of analysis that composed the ?new? cultural geography. To do this, the paper develops the concepts of unit, vibration and tone to unpack interfaces as sets of entities that work together to shape the experiences and responses of users. As such, the article provides a methodological vocabulary for the analysis of how interfaces operate to modulate user response and action on a series of habitual and un-reflected upon levels and thereby to create outcomes that suit their owners and operators.

N2  - This article explores the ways in which contemporary digital visualization technologies offer grounds for a reappraisal of the relationship between qualitative and quantitative data. Using the example of a 3D digital model of the city of Manchester, the question of descriptive adequacy in the social sciences is addressed.The model is an interesting descriptive device oriented simultaneously to providing an accurate account of what is present in the world and a persuasive image of what that world could become. The analysis asks what kind of descriptive device the 3D model is, and looks at how it exercises its persuasive effects. While attending to how diverse knowledge forms are rendered compatible in the model, the concept of `discontinuous data' is introduced to draw attention to incompatible knowledges that do not appear in the model.The article explores the potential of such models to reconfigure discontinuous data forms and to produce provocative counter-maps.

N2  - The aim of this research is to study the factors impacting usage of mobile banking (mBanking) by consumers in India. The study adopts the Extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) with Social Value (SV), Monetary Value (MV), Emotional Value (EV), Quality Value (QV), Trust and the moderation effect of gender. Online and offline survey methods were used to collect primary data from 457 Indian consumers using mBanking. SPSS AMOS was utilized to empirically validate the conceptual model, test research hypothesis and moderation effect. The factors effort expectancy (EE), monetary value (MV), emotional value (EV), quality value (QV) and trust (TR) were found to be significant on behavioural intent (BI), whereas performance expectancy (PE) and social value (SV) were not found to be significant. Banking organizations can formulate strategies to attract new consumers and continue to engage in retaining consumers in using these influencing factors to adopt mBanking and other related mobile financial services (MFS). The study integrates perceived value components and trust with UTAUT2 to form a comprehensive model for examining mBanking adoption.

N2  - We examined how family communication patterns (FCPs) are associated with frequency of adolescent?parent communication in person, over the phone, via text message, and via email. Adolescents (N = 195) aged 13 to 18 completed an online survey assessing FCPs and frequency of communication methods used with parents. The results revealed that both frequency and method of communication differed by general FCPs; adolescents in higher conformity families reported less frequent text messaging with mothers than adolescents in lower conformity families, and adolescents in higher conversation families (mothers only) and lower conformity families reported more frequent email communication with parents. Results set the stage for future research to further explore the processes and outcomes of adolescent?parent communication through communication technology.

N2  - The pervasive use of mobile information technologies brings new patterns of media usage, but also challenges to the measurement of media exposure. Researchers wishing to, for example, understand the nature of selective exposure on algorithmically driven platforms need to precisely attribute individuals? exposure to specific content. Prior research has used tracking data to show that survey-based self-reports of media exposure are critically unreliable. So far, however, little effort has been invested into assessing the specific biases of tracking methods themselves. Using data from a multimethod study, we show that tracking data from mobile devices is linked to systematic distortions in self-report biases. Further inherent but unobservable sources of bias, along with potential solutions, are discussed.

N2  - Digital revolution is instrumental to the wave of globalisation and transformation of the global economy. But the pace of digital transformation and service trade is low in the West African region. This article investigates the effect of digital transformation on the development of service trade in the region. This research captured digitisation in two standpoints: internet penetration rate and mobile subscription rate. The Im-Pesaran-Shin unit-root test affirms that the model is appropriate for panel autoregressive distributed lag estimation method. Adopting pool mean group estimator, the results attest for the existence of cointegrations in the model. The estimations reveal that the effect of digitisation on service trade is a long-run phenomenon. While the result is robust with export, it is not consistent with import. The long-run positive impact of digitisation on service export ranges from 0.087% to 0.159%, depending on the proxy for digitisation. The overall short-run effect is not statistically significant in export and not robust in import. It is reportedly consistent in some countries but not robust with some others. The region needs to rally in adopting and adapting to the new face of technology to improve service trade.JEL Codes: C23, F14, O33

N2  - AbstractThe purpose of this article is to explore the mediating role of perceived usefulness, trust and attitude on a user?s intention towards use of mobile wallets in India. While mediation has been studied by earlier researchers in the context of online commerce, mobile banking, short message service (SMS) banking, mobile money, etc., not many studies exist in the context of mobile wallets. Considering the potential of mobile wallets in India, previous relationships from the theories of technology adoption like technology acceptance model (TAM) and unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) were adapted to investigate the determinants of user attitude and intention towards mobile wallet adoption. Based on data from 744 respondents collected through a survey, partial least squares (PLS) structural equation modelling was used to test the research model. Convenience sampling was used to select the respondents. The results revealed that out of the nine paths wherein mediation was examined, in two paths full mediation was found while it was partial in the remaining cases. This study extends research in explaining attitude and intention through multiple mediating relationships. The implications for research and practice and future research directions are discussed.

N2  - Facebook?s usage has reached a point that the platform?s infrastructural ambitions are to be taken very seriously. To understand the company?s evolution in the age of mobile media, we critically engage with the political economy of platformization. This article puts forward a conceptual framework and methodological apparatus to study Facebook?s economic growth and expanding platform boundaries in the mobile ecosystem through an analysis of the Facebook Messenger app. Through financial and institutional analysis, we examine Messenger?s business dimension and draw on platform studies and information systems research to survey its technical dimension. By retracing how Facebook, through Messenger, operationalizes platform power, this article attempts to bridge the gap between these various disciplines by demonstrating how platforms emerge and how their apps may evolve into platforms of their own, thereby gaining infrastructural properties. It is argued that Messenger functions as a ?platform instance? that facilitates transactions with a wide range of institutions within the boundaries of the app and far beyond.

N2  - This article provides evidence that there is a substantial difference between slider scales and visual analogue scales (VAS), two types of rating scales used in web surveys that are frequently mixed up. In an experimental design, both scales were compared to standard HTML radio buttons and offered three, five, or seven response options. Slider scales negatively affect response rate (especially on mobile devices), the sample composition, the distribution of values, and also increase response times. VAS and radio buttons, however, can be used without negative side effects, even on touch screen devices like smartphones. Overall, it is recommended to avoid slider scales. As small differences in rating scales?here drag and drop versus point and click?have a huge influence on data collection, an optimal implementation of VAS is suggested. However, measurement of discrete variables with a moderate number of response options should be done with radio buttons scales unless a small screen size?for example, on smartphones?requires an economical use of space.

N2  - Given the high cost of traditional survey administration (postal mail, phone) and the limits of convenience samples such as university students, online samples offer a much welcomed alternative. Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) has been especially popular among academics for conducting surveys and experiments. Prior research has shown that AMT samples are not representative of the general population along some dimensions, but evidence suggests that these differences may not undermine the validity of AMT research. The authors revisit this comparison by analyzing responses to identical survey questions administered to both a U.S. national sample and AMT participants at the same time. The authors compare the two samples on sociodemographic factors, online experiences, and prosociality. The authors show that the two samples are different not just demographically but also regarding their online behaviors and standard survey measures of prosocial behaviors and attitudes. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for data collected on AMT.

N2  - This article assesses the rationale for India?s November 2016 demonetization, in terms of its origins and impact over the following year. I argue that this intervention was conceived and understood as part of a larger international monetary experiment. The article draws upon international media commentary, impact assessments by Indian scholars and the professed goals of the Government of India. Having established a direct link between demonetization and an advancing ?cashless agenda? around the world, I situate Narendra Modi?s Digital India programme as the putative foundation for a transactional economy. Drawing upon ethnographic studies exploring the everyday experience of India?s year of living digitally, this article raises the critical question of who must, or indeed can, bear the transaction costs of this digital utopia. In conclusion, I argue that the rapid expansion of digital money situates these concerns at the heart of social and cultural, as much as economic, analysis.

N2  - Driven by the rapid adoption of Internet-based technologies amongst producers in the Global South, the question of how and whether global value chain arrangements are reconfigured remains open to debate. This article addresses the changing practices of export-oriented smallholders accompanying the transition from simple phone towards smartphone use. Our dynamic approach compares cross-sectional survey data from 2013 and 2017 to answer to what extent Kenyan smallholders have adopted the Internet, which digital practices in relation to agricultural value chains they use and how this affects the inter-firm coordination between smallholders and subsequent actors. Smartphones have gained broad importance for smallholders as they are used for digital practices in value chains. Contrary to the debated dark sides of Internet connectivity, we can however not confirm sweeping digital control or value appropriation by lead firms. So far, long-established, analogue practices widely persist in arrangements between smallholders and exporters. Nevertheless, smartphones are used to nurture multilateral knowledge networks of unprecedented reach and size and further allow for incipient experiments with marketing strategies on digital marketing platforms devoted to domestic markets. We argue that these practices resemble strategic niche seeking that has to be interpreted in relation to captive export arrangements. With qualitatively and quantitatively increasing options to access and share knowledge and to market commodities, the Internet can serve to navigate the multiplicity of chain alternatives (domestic production, informal export production). Such niches should be considered as creating leverage against the take it or leave it deal of captive export production.
