N2  - There is a common perception that ?every refugee carries a smartphone?, but research on this phenomenon is limited. We conducted a representative survey of 400 refugees to Germany which provides insight into their use of digital media in preparation for and during forced migration. We also asked whether digital media shaped images of and expectations about the refugees? target country Germany. The data show that refugees are not a homogeneous group and that usage patterns depend on regional origins. Internet use also contributed to a positively biased perception of Germany, but the effect of traditional media use was stronger.

N2  - BackgroundPersonal Mobility Device (PMD) refers to ?Smart Mobility? or ?Micro Mobility? for one or two persons, and it is appreciated as an environmental-friendly means operated by electric resources (Burns, 2013). According to Transparency Market Research in 2016, the world?s personal transport market is expected to grow two times bigger from 2014 to 2023. In fact, PMD has various product types, competence levels and safety problems, so it cannot help covering many user experiences (UXs). Thus, this study aimed to analyze previous researches about PMD in terms of UX and usability.MethodIn this study, 160 papers were collected through five search engines with keyword combinations of UX (e.g., user interaction and interface) and PMD (e.g., Segway and electric vehicle). Through two filtering processes, the 19 papers were finally selected, and each was analyzed by the next six criteria; device types, research environments, participants, user experience factors, UX evaluation methodologies, and UX measurement.ResultsThe results showed that Segway was the most common device type rather than electric vehicles, powered wheelchair, proposed product, E-scooter, E-bicycle, and E-bike. In addition, the outdoor environment accounted for the biggest percentage of researches beyond indoor, semi-outdoor, and online survey. People who participated in researches were usually expert and novice, who got used to handle the assigned PMD for each paper. A total of 26 UX factors (e.g., effectiveness, safety, usability, and acceptability) was collected and classified considering each experimental context; safety and usability turned out to be the most two important factors. From the UX methodological view, the PMD were usually evaluated by a questionnaire rather than by objective methods, which enable the participant to give more instinctive reactions and the researchers to gather quantitative data easily. In this way, UX objective measurements on previous researches were categorized into body observation (e.g., body angle on device), usage behavior (e.g., running distance) and compatibility on field (e.g., riding against traffic).Discussion  OMF), effectiveness, device performance, efficiency, and physical load (subjectively measured factors; SMF). Satisfaction included intuitive, customer-services-quality, charging, operability, comfort, predictability, mobility, and maintainability (SMF). Acceptability included compatibility (OMF), aesthetics, device learnability, cost, and training (SMF). Safety included stability, risk behavior (OMF), independency, guard, controllability, security, and testability (SMF).These results implied that most UX factors for PMD were usually measured subjectively rather than objectively. In particular, satisfaction had not been measured objectively even though it plays a significant role in UX factors with usability, acceptability, and safety. In other areas, some researches used objective measurements such as heart rate, EEG, or action log for sensing satisfaction (Gao, 2012; Taylor, 2015), so it is also possible to measure PMD satisfaction using objective methods.In this study, the previous researches about UX and PMD were analyzed to identify the trend of the UX research of PMD. A total of 19 papers were collected and classified by device type, research environment, participants, UX factors, evaluation method, and objective measurements. As a result, it was found that various UX factors were introduced, and the systematized UX factors framework was proposed. Through this UX framework, we expect to apply more objective measurements on UX factors of PMD in future researches.

N2  - The viewing of television programming on screens other than a television set has become increasingly common. This article discusses the different modes of viewing that have emerged as a result of timeshifting, downloading, streaming and mobile technologies. Using data collected from an online survey (n = 671) over a six-month period in 2010?2011, we present a descriptive and inferential statistical analysis of both traditional and emerging modes of viewing. We also examine whether significant differences exist across three demographic variables: gender, age and country or region of residence. Our findings show that while the majority of viewing still takes place in front of a television screen, the computer has achieved secondary screen status among North Americans and equal status among younger viewers and Europeans. Viewing on a mobile device remains minimal across all demographics.

N2  - The ubiquity of mobile devices and the apps that power them has spurred concerns that they are contributing to the decline in news media use. Mobile devices, however, have been credited with spurring political participation. In its examination of app-reliant individuals, this study found that reliance on apps positively predicts political participation, and respondents who rely heavily on mobile apps for political information are more politically active than light app users on six of the seven measures of nononline participation and three of the six measures of online political activity. Heavy-reliant users also rely more heavily on all six online-only media tested than light app users and rely more heavily on broadcast television news, CNN, and news magazines. Data were collected from October 31, 2016, through November 2, 2016, from 644 respondents of a national online panel.

N2  - Researchers attempting to survey refugees over time face methodological issues because of the transient nature of the target population. In this article, we examine whether applying smartphone technology could alleviate these issues. We interviewed 529 refugees and afterward invited them to four follow-up mobile web surveys and to install a research app for passive mobile data collection. Our main findings are as follows: First, participation in mobile web surveys declines rapidly and is rather selective with significant coverage and nonresponse biases. Second, we do not find any factor predicting types of smartphone ownership, and only low reading proficiency is significantly correlated with app nonparticipation. However, obtaining sufficiently large samples is challenging?only 5 percent of the eligible refugees installed our app. Third, offering a 30 Euro incentive leads to a statistically insignificant increase in participation in passive mobile data collection.

N2  - The development of information and communication technologies has led to the rise of new working forms in firms, some of which are temporally and spatially dispersed, such as telework practices. However, ?telework? is a broad concept, including different forms of remote work as well as diverse reasons and performance implications for the separation of work from the firm's premises. Following this consideration, this paper has explored two sides of telework: 1) the main types of telework practises adopted by firms in relation to their technological, organizational and environmental context; 2) the association between the adoption of telework practices and labour productivity. Specifically, analysing data gathered through a survey analysis conducted from 2005 and 2009 on Italian enterprises, we identified two main typologies of telework: 1) firms using forms of home-based telework; 2) firms using mobile forms of telework. Whereas firms prevalently using the first type of telework modality do not exhibit a superior endowment of information systems and do not exhibit higher labour productivity, firms deploying ?mobile work? practices are characterized by a higher adoption of information systems, deal with more dynamic business environments and exhibit higher labour productivity with respect to firms that do not use telework practices.

N2  - An online survey was conducted in Estonia among 223 judges, prosecutors, police officers and victim support officers; 223 victims were interviewed via phone and 26 legal professionals (including lawyers) were interviewed face to face with an aim to determine the level of protection of victims after implementation of the Directive 2012/29/EU. The results reveal that victims lack knowledge about their rights although law enforcement agencies are, in general, convinced that they do a good job in this respect. Victims desire criminal proceedings in which they are respected, their opinion is heard and matters, and they are kept informed about developments of the case. The reality, however, does not meet their expectations. As law enforcement agencies are focused on determining guilt of a defendant, victims? needs fall to the background. There seems to be a dichotomy between the expectations of law enforcement officials and those of the victims: While the latter awaits to be contacted and informed, the officials expect at least certain initiative from victims themselves. The idea that victims should be allowed to speak just to provide them with satisfaction and sense of fair proceedings is still somewhat strange for the authorities. When it comes to sentencing, some state officials believe that the opinions of a victim should not even be asked as determination of the punishment is court?s business. Victims? opinions are much more readily heard in the conciliation proceedings, which are based on the ideas of restorative justice, but in which defendants? needs seem to have been forgotten.

N2  - Filter questions are used to administer follow-up questions to eligible respondents while allowing respondents who are not eligible to skip those questions. Filter questions can be asked in either the interleafed or the grouped formats. In the interleafed format, the follow-ups are asked immediately after the filter question; in the grouped format, follow-ups are asked after the filter question block. Underreporting can occur in the interleafed format due to respondents? desire to reduce the burden of the survey. This phenomenon is called motivated misreporting. Because smartphone surveys are more burdensome than web surveys completed on a computer or laptop, due to the smaller screen size, longer page loading times, and more distraction, we expect that motivated misreporting is more pronounced on smartphones. Furthermore, we expect that misreporting occurs not only in the filter questions themselves but also extends to data quality in the follow-up questions. We randomly assigned 3,517 respondents of a German online access panel to either the PC or the smartphone. Our results show that while both PC and smartphone respondents trigger fewer filter questions in the interleafed format than the grouped format, we did not find differences between PC and smartphone respondents regarding the number of triggered filter questions. However, smartphone respondents provide lower data quality in the follow-up questions, especially in the grouped format. We conclude with recommendations for web survey designers who intend to incorporate smartphone respondents in their surveys.

N2  - Much research has been done comparing grids and item-by-item formats. However, the results are mixed, and more research is needed especially when a significant proportion of respondents answer using smartphones. In this study, we implemented an experiment with seven groups (n = 1,476), varying the device used (PC or smartphone), the presentation of the questions (grids, item-by-item vertical, item-by-item horizontal), and, in the case of smartphones only, the visibility of the ?next? button (always visible or only visible at the end of the page, after scrolling down). The survey was conducted by the Netquest online fieldwork company in Spain in 2016. We examined several outcomes for three sets of questions, which are related to respondent behavior (completion time, lost focus, answer changes, and screen orientation) and data quality (item missing data, nonsubstantive responses, instructional manipulation check failure, and nondifferentiation). The most striking difference found is for the placement of the next button in the smartphone item-by-item conditions: When the button is always visible, item missing data are substantially higher.

N2  - As an important part of the public service and educational infrastructures for national culture and heritage culture, a virtual museum presents the user experience of a real museum, with visitors, educators, and tourists interacting with the prepared digital culture contents by a mouse, touch panel, and other augmented reality devices. The goal of virtual museum is to help students and visitors to move around the virtual museum space freely and generate experience and satisfaction from the fruition of cultural heritage anytime, anywhere, and from any device. This study presents a hybrid three-dimensional virtual museum based on panoramic images and three-dimensional models. A technical framework of hybrid three-dimensional virtual museum is proposed on the basis of a typical three-tier architecture, which includes the data layer, technique supporting layer, and application layer. A hybrid three-dimensional data organization approach with geo-referenced sequence panoramic images and three-dimensional models is designed to build the data layer of hybrid three-dimensional virtual museum. A three-dimensional scene of geo-referenced sequence panoramic images and three-dimensional models is created in real time using Unity three-dimensional and web service under the mobile Internet environment for hybrid three-dimensional virtual museum. The different applications of hybrid three-dimensional virtual museum based on the data layer and technique infrastructure are designed to achieve handheld virtual museum guidance and navigation, three-dimensional browsing, and heritage culture information query for visitors with smartphones to access anytime and anywhere. As an example, a hybrid three-dimensional virtual museum application for Jinsha Archaeological Site Museum is developed with the proposed approach. The geo-referenced sequence panoramic images of museum galleries, together with three-dimensional models of cultural relics, can integrate seamlessly to a three-dimensional reality-based museum space where users can move around the space actively and freely with all kinds of personal computer and smartphone clients.

N2  - The study of mundane, everyday uses of the Internet remains an emerging field of inquiry. Analysing data from a large seven country survey of Internet use and adapting concepts and methods developed by Bourdieu, we show that there are distinct clusters of users who use the Internet in diverse ways to solve everyday problems, such as buying a mobile phone or diagnosing an illness. Such everyday problem-solving is dependent upon degrees of economic, social, digital and cultural capital, and varies across countries. A comparative methodological strategy combined the use of multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), and for the first time in the field, multiple factor analysis for contingency tables (MFACTs). Extending the work of Bourdieu and the sociology of class more generally, we argue that digital capital functions as a bridging capital aiding the convertibility of other forms of capital to the benefit of already advantaged groups.

N2  - Cell phone use has become a mainstay in the lives of young adults, with 93% of Millennials owning a smartphone. With the increased accessibility of technology, individuals? cell phone use may lead to personal distress in various facets of life. Specifically, problematic cell phone use may be the result of attempts to fulfill emotional needs or avoid connection with others. The present study used a systemic, attachment-based lens to investigate the roles of parental and romantic attachment in problematic cell phone use. A sample of 479 young adults (ages 18?26) completed an online survey gauging their cell phone use and attachment styles. Mediation analyzes were run to determine if adult attachment mediates the relationship from parental attachment to problematic cell phone use. The results found that attachment anxiety mediates the relationship between communication and alienation subscales for mother and alienation only for father to problematic cell phone use. Clinical implications are discussed with results informing assessment, prevention, and intervention efforts for individuals, families, and couples.

N2  - Design principles for survey questionnaires viewed on desktop and laptop computers are increasingly being seen as inadequate for the design of questionnaires viewed on smartphones. Insights gained from empirical research can help those conducting mobile surveys to improve their questionnaires. This article reports on a systematic literature review of research presented or published between 2007 and 2016 that evaluated the effect of smartphone questionnaire design features on indicators of response quality. The evidence suggests that survey designers should make efforts to ?optimize? their questionnaires to make them easier to complete on smartphones, fit question content to the width of smartphone screens to prevent horizontal scrolling, and choose simpler types of questions (single-choice questions, multiple-choice questions, text-entry boxes) over more complicated types of questions (large grids, drop boxes, slider questions). Based on these results, we identify design heuristics, or general principles, for creating effective smartphone questionnaires. We distinguish between five of them: readability, ease of selection, visibility across the page, simplicity of design elements, and predictability across devices. They provide an initial framework by which to evaluate smartphone questionnaires, though empirical testing and further refinement of the heuristics is necessary.

N2  - The rise in the network society might lead to a decline in face-to-face contact as people substitute it with more mediated forms, or an increase in both face-to-face and mediated contact as complements, with unknown consequences for social support. This article examines trends in social contact, mediated contact (phone, online, etc.), and social support in 2002, 2006 and 2010, using aggregated ABS General Social Survey data. Results show an aggregate decline in face-to-face contact and rise in mediated contact in Australia between 2002 and 2010, but no aggregate decline in perceived social support, and a strong positive individual-level association between both forms of contact and social support. There are, however, signs of an emerging class-based digital divide, with low-income older men and less educated respondents reporting lower levels of mediated contact and social support by 2010.

N2  - Digital technologies have redefined how people use audio media, especially for the millennial audience segment. Faced with the challenge from streaming music, many broadcast radio stations have launched their own mobile apps to compete with the new audio services such as Spotify. Guided by the uses and gratifications conceptual framework, this study employed a national survey to investigate millennials? perceptions of the substitutability and complementarity of broadcast radio, its apps, and music streaming services. The results showed that while radio listeners perceived broadcast radio and its apps as similar products, they regarded music streaming services as distinct from the two. In addition, this study examined motivators behind the diverse perceptions and identified information, escapism, entertainment, and socialization as important. The results suggest that radio stations should take advantage of the mobile technology and offer unique values through their apps, rather than duplicate the offline consumption experience.

N2  - The current study examines cyberbullying and victimization among African American college students who spend large amounts of time on the Internet and using their smartphones. In a survey of 321 African American college students, the most common venues for victimization occurred through text messages, phone calls, and social networking sites. Posting indiscreet images and sharing personal information with a large number of Facebook friends were positively associated with the victimization. Cyberbullying perpetration, as measured by Cyberbullying Questionnaire (CBQ), revealed a significant gender difference, with male students exhibiting higher prevalence. In a multiple regression analysis, the phenomenon of online disinhibition?a lessening of inhibitions during online interactions that would otherwise be present in face-to-face interactions?emerged as the strongest predictor of cyberbullying perpetration. Recommendations for future research include studying the negative impact of cyberbullying among African American adults, particularly in the workplace.

N2  - Experience sampling or ecological momentary assessment offers unique insights into how people think, feel, and behave in their natural environments. Because the method is able to capture situational variation as it happens in ?real time,? experience sampling has become an increasingly popular method in social and personality, psychology, and beyond. With the ubiquity of smartphone ownership and the recent technical advances, conducting experience sampling studies on participants? own devices has become increasingly easy to do. Here, we present one reliable, user-friendly, highly customizable, and cost-effective solution. The web-based application, SurveySignal, integrates the idea of using short message service (SMS) messages as signals and reminders, according to fixed or random schedules and of linking these signals to mobile surveys designed with common online survey software. We describe the method and customizable parameters and then present evaluation results from nine social?psychological studies conducted with SurveySignal (overall N = 1,852). Mean response rates averaged 77% and the median response delay to signals was 8 min. An experimental manipulation of the reminder signal in one study showed that installing a reminder SMS led to a 10% increase in response rates. Next to advantages and limitations of the SMS approach, we discuss how ecologically valid research methods such as smartphone experience sampling can enrich psychological research.

N2  - Background:Upper limb, in particular forequarter amputations, require highly customised devices that are often expensive and underutilised.Objectives:The objective of this study was to design and develop a comfortable 3D-printed cosmetic forequarter prosthetic device, which was lightweight, cool to wear, had an elbow that could lock, matched the appearance of the contralateral arm and was completely free of metal for a specific user?s needs.Study Design:Device design.Technique:An iterative user-centred design approach was used for digitising, designing and developing a functional 3D-printed prosthetic arm for an acquired forequarter amputation, while optimising the fit and function after each prototype.Results:The cost of the final arm was 20% less expensive than a traditionally-made forequarter prostheses in Singapore. The Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with Assistive Technology (QUEST) 2.0 survey was administered, with results indicating that the 3D-printed arm was preferred due to its overall effectiveness, accurate size, ease of use and suspension. However, durability had a lower score, and the weight of the arm was 100?g heavier than the user?s current prosthesis. The technique described resulted in a precise fitting and shaped forequarter prosthesis for the user. Using the user?s feedback in the iterations of the design resulted in improved QUEST survey results indicating the device was effective, easy to use, perceived as lighter and more secure than the user?s traditionally-made device.Conclusion:A fully customised cosmetic forequarter prosthesis was designed and developed using digital scanning, computer-aided design modelling and 3D printing for a specific user. These technologies enable new avenues for highly complex prosthetic design innovations.

N2  - In this study, we assessed the status of electronic recruitment for U.S. state government employees and analyzed the issues and challenges state governments faced while they implemented e-recruitment systems. All of the 23 state personnel agencies that responded to a phone survey either offered downloadable application forms or allowed candidates to submit applications online. Ten states had adopted options for assessing applicants and selecting job candidates online, but only three states reported that they had adopted online testing. The number of applications received online increased from 2002 to 2003, and the most common implementation challenges that states faced when introducing e-recruitment were budget constraints, technical difficulties, and HR staff adapting to using a new system. While 15 states reported that they evaluated their electronic recruitment system, only three said they measured the cost per hire. Based on the survey responses, we conclude this article by presenting lessons and implications for effectively implementing e-recruitment for state government employees.

N2  - Nepali information and communication technology (ICT) policies, informed by dominant international discourses on internet and ICT for development, have attributed a ?self-evident? positive impact to economic growth. Such a conception is inconclusive and hides the underlying socioeconomic inequalities and the barriers they oppose to universal connectivity ambitions. The self-evident discourse overlooks the importance of adjacent infrastructures like electricity, critical for efficient functioning of a ?digital society?. History has shown Nepal?s eagerness to buy the irrational exuberance of the dot-com era. It also shows policy targets were not based on local evidence and experiences. While the question about when the next bubble will emerge and burst is debatable, the techno-deterministic arguments need to be checked in light of evidence. We offer insights from import trajectories since the drafting of the first IT policy. The proliferation of mobile phones is explored in light of data consumption (i.e., usage) and access during the deadly earthquake in 2015. The evidence clearly highlights the mismatch between connectivity ambitions and socioeconomic realities in a stratified information society. We contend that the self-evident visions of connectivity need to be checked empirically. We call for internet and ICT policies that have a nuanced conceptualisation of access and its gradation.

U.S. teleworkers (N = 384) completed an online survey and self-reported on dimensions of communication channel satisfaction, job satisfaction, and personality. Results indicated that extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness are positively correlated with job satisfaction. Additionally, significant moderating effects were found for the relationship between openness and phone and video communication, and agreeableness and phone communication on job satisfaction. Findings from this study yield important practical implications for organizations including suggestions for optimizing communication satisfaction for employees of differing personality types and recommendations to help organizations effectively hire and retain teleworkers.

Those youth who engaged in aggressive behavior online and those who used the Internet on a cell phone were about twice as likely to be classified as high risk (having experienced high parent conflict or child maltreatment) as compared to other Internet users. Those youth who talked with known friends online were significantly less likely to be included in the high risk group. Controlling for demographic and Internet use characteristics, youth who received an aggressive sexual solicitation were almost 2.5 times as likely to report experiencing physical abuse, sexual abuse or high parent conflict. Implications for prevention are discussed, including avenues for reaching high risk populations of youth.

N2  - This article analyses how changing life situations affect media use, conceptualized as a question of how biographical disruption could destabilize media repertoires and public connection. To answer this question, the analysis draws on qualitative data from a comprehensive study of media use in Norway, with in-depth interviews and media diaries. The theoretical approach joins domestication and media repertoire theory with research on public connection, considering the ubiquity of digital media in contemporary society. Findings indicate that smartphone use is key to people?s reorientations in periods of change, and that intimate and emotional responses to mobile media warrant closer attention. The article contributes to debates on the transformation of media repertoires, a question of growing concern within research on cross-media use, and to long-standing interests in the role of media in everyday life and as central to public connection.

N2  - Rising demand for parking at suburban transit stations, such as the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) District in San Francisco, California, necessitates strategies to manage traveler demand. To better manage parking supply, researchers implemented a smart parking field test at the Rock-ridge BART station from 2004 to 2006 to evaluate the effects of smart parking technologies [changeable message signs (CMSs), Internet reservations and billing, mobile phone and personal digital assistant communications, and a wireless parking lot counting system] on transit ridership and response to service pricing. Researchers used expert interviews, Internet surveys, focus groups, and parking reservation data to conduct this analysis. Survey data indicated that the field test increased BART trips and resulted in 9.7 fewer miles per participant per month on average. Key lessons learned include that it would have been beneficial to anticipate additional time for project scoping and permitting, and that fixed wayfinding signs were beneficial in terms of both directing vehicles from the highway to the smart parking lot and addressing resident concerns about increased traffic. In addition, most participants continued to use the service when fees were implemented. However, CMSs were not widely employed in users? decision-making processes in this application. Finally, the wireless counting system worked well, with the exception of the in-ground sensors, which were prone to miscounts.

Three of the six technologies?notebooks, netbooks, and tablet PCs?are information technologies, while the remaining three technologies?Wii, Kinect, and digital videos (DVs)?are entertainment technologies. A telephone survey was adopted to obtain a representative sample, which obtained 1157 valid calls with a response rate of 53.1%. Two conclusions are drawn from the data analysis. First, lifestyles did play a significant role in predicting the adoption of the six technologies. Second, this study found that demographics and mass media use were more predictive of the adoption of information technologies than that of the adoption of entertainment technologies.

N2  - Purpose:To discover oculofacial plastic surgeon practice patterns for cautery selection in the setting of implantable electronic devices and present guidelines based on a review of current literature.Methods:A 10-Question web-based survey was sent to the email list serve of the American Society of Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery to determine surgeon cautery preference in the setting of various implantable electronic devices and comfort level with the guidelines for cautery selection in their practice or institution. The relationship between survey questions was assessed for statistical significance using Pearson?s Chi-square tests.Results:Two hundred ninety-three (41% response rate) surveys were completed and included for analysis. Greater than half of respondents either had no policy (36%) or were unaware of a policy (19%) in their practice or institution regarding cautery selection in patients with a cardiac implantable electronic device. Bipolar cautery was favored for use in patients with a cardiac implantable electronic device (79%?80%) and this number dropped in patients with implantable neurostimulators (30%). Overall, one-third of respondents did not feel comfortable with their practice/institution policy.Conclusion:Choices and comfort level among oculofacial plastic surgeons for cautery selection in patients with implantable electronic devices vary considerably, and some choices may increase the risk for interference-related complications. Practice patterns vary significantly in the setting of a neurostimulator or cochlear implant, where interference can cause thermal injury to the brain and implant damage, respectively. Guidelines are proposed for cautery selection in patients with implantable electronic devices undergoing oculofacial plastic surgery.

N2  - With increasing usage of electronic devices, people are creating digital footprints of their everyday actions. These footprints come in the form of big data, and can provide useful insights into customer preferences, thus enabling companies to gain business benefits. However, customers may perceive usage of their personal information as a threat. The telecommunications sector is facing this issue. It is capable of collecting huge amount of data due to wide usage of smartphones and mobile Internet. Yet, it is unable to capitalize on these data. To manage customer perception of information risks in giving telecommunications companies permission to use their personal information, this study examines factors that influence customers? risk perception. A survey of 512 Internet panel members in Korea shows that information practices play an important role in shaping information privacy concerns, trust, and perceived information risks. Information privacy concern is the strongest predictor of perceived information risks, followed by perceived data control, and trust. Perceived policy awareness and perceived information protection significantly influence perceived data control. The findings imply that telecommunications companies ought to increase the level of customer trust, improve their information practices, and reduce customers? information privacy concerns if they want to lower customer perception toward information risks.

N2  - AbstractThe advent of Web 2.0-based Internet technologies coupled with mobile digital telecommunication devices have altered the landscape of interaction between a firm and its stakeholders. Increasingly firms are interacting with their stakeholders through electronic means such as group e-mails, batch Short Messaging Services (SMSs), short text posts, social networking sites, and others. This is ushering a rich era in firm?stakeholder communication occurring on real-time basis (24?7) and from anywhere. Technology-based interactions are viewed as lacking the humanistic perspective. This is especially true for such stakeholders who are differently abled, illiterate, elderly, and others who are not able to adapt to the new realities in technology-based firm?stakeholder communication. In this research, the author explored the effect of inclusion of humanistic orientation in technology-based interaction between a firm and its stakeholders. One hundred and fifty two CSR managers? responses were considered for scale development to measure the variables, firm management engagement (FME), firm technology medium deployed (FTMD), stakeholder interaction (SI), humanistic orientation in interaction (HOI), and interactional stakeholder satisfaction (ISS) with the help of a structured questionnaire survey instrument. Furthermore, a model on ISS was developed. In the model, FME and FTMD were the antecedent variables; SI was the mediating variable; and HOI was the moderating variable with ISS as the dependent variable.

N2  - The Oregon Citizens? Initiative Review (CIR) distinguishes itself by linking a small deliberative body to the larger electoral process. Since 2010, CIR citizen panels have been a legislatively authorized part of Oregon general elections to promote a more informed electorate. The CIR gathers a representative cross-section of two dozen voters for 5 days of deliberation on a single ballot measure. The process culminates in the citizen panelists writing a Citizens? Statement that the secretary of state inserts into the official Voters? Pamphlet sent to each registered voter. This study analyzes the effect of one such Citizens? Statement from the 2010 general election. In Study 1, an online survey experiment found that reading this Statement influenced Oregon voters? values trade-offs, issue knowledge, and vote intentions. In Study 2, regression analysis of a cross-sectional phone survey found a parallel association between the Statement?s use and voting choices but yielded some mixed findings.

N2  - In what conditions does a technical mediation allow subjects to meet and to recognize each other? In digital networks, virtual spaces of collaborative work and play give rise to interactions at a distance between users. But to what extent do these interactions allow each partner to recognize the living presence of other perceiving subjects? In order to study this question, we use perceptual supplementation devices (more commonly known as sensory substitution systems). These devices for prosthetic perception represent an extreme situation, which is highly revealing as to the way that technological devices transform our perceptual capacities. Here, they make it possible to identify the conditions for the existence of perceptual crossing, i.e. a situation which makes it possible for two subjects to recognize each other. To carry out this research, we propose a minimalist experimental paradigm, constructed with the aid of the `Tactos' system. This perceptual supplementation device has been developed in order to give a tactile perception of digital forms present on the screen of a computer. When two such devices are connected in a network, they also allow tactile interactions between users at a distance (one can speak of distal caresses). The minimal version of this device gives scope for an experimental study and a precise analysis of the perceptual interactions. These experiments lead us to suggest several conditions which seem necessary for the constitution of a lived experience of perceptual crossing: the presence for each partner of a body-image perceivable by the other participants; a direct link between the perceptual activity and the dynamics of this body-image; and the impossibility for each partner to themselves perceive the body-image they present to the other participants.

N2  - Post-discharge phone calls are a widely used yet suboptimal method of ascertaining recovery of day surgery patients. We compared the efficiency of an automated electronic system of follow-up, the Day Care Anaesthesia Outcomes Recording Registry (DayCOR), and a telephone call system that was standard practice in our non-profit private healthcare organisation in Victoria, Australia. We also surveyed a group of clinicians to assess their acceptance of DayCOR compared with the telephone call system. DayCOR is a web-based system which collects, alerts, manages and analyses patient-reported outcomes. Patients may opt in to respond to a 15-question survey via a link sent by text message or email. DayCOR?s patient response rate was 77.5%, compared with 66.0% for the telephone call system. Both systems collected data on clinical, process, and experience outcomes. Completeness of data collection was 100% using DayCOR compared with 51%?61.4% of data items using the telephone call system. We estimated that replacing our telephone call system with DayCOR to follow up 60,000 day surgery patients a year would represent an annual cost reduction of AUD$101,345 (53%) using manual demographic data entry, and AUD$142,745 (74%) if DayCOR was integrated with the institution?s existing administrative software. Seventy-eight percent of day surgery nurses and 94% of anaesthetists preferred DayCOR to the telephone call system. All anaesthetists surveyed stated that DayCOR provided more valuable feedback, and almost one-fifth had changed their clinical practice as a result. DayCOR?s efficiency and acceptability will allow more effective collection of post-discharge patient outcomes than is currently possible in our institution, and will support interventional studies aimed at improving quality of recovery of day surgery patients.

N2  - ObjectiveOur study aimed to measure the percentage of reported olfactory or taste losses and their severity, recovery time, and association with other features in a large cohort of patients with COVID-19.Study DesignProspective survey.SettingQuaternary medical center and online survey.MethodsThe perceived chemosensory capacities of 655 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were assessed with 11-point category rating scales (0, no function; 10, normal function). Patients were contacted in hospital, by phone calls, or by internet regarding their ability to smell or taste, and 143 were interviewed by phone 1 to 4 months later to assess the recovery of their chemosensory abilities.ResultsThe prevalence of self-reported olfactory, general taste, and taste quality?specific disturbances (sweet, sour, bitter, and salty) in the patients with COVID-19 were 82.4% (95% CI, 79.5%-85.3%), 76.2% (95% CI, 72.9%-79.4%), and 52.2% (95% CI, 48.3%-56.1%), respectively. The majority reported anosmia (42.9%). The presence of chemosensory symptoms was not associated with COVID-19 severity. At a median time >2 months after the onset of symptoms, rates of total and partial olfaction recovery were 53.8% and 44.7%, while complete or partial return to previous taste function was 68.3% and 27.6%. Less than 5% of the patients reported no chemosensory function improvement at all.ConclusionThe prevalence of self-reported chemosensory dysfunction is high among patients with COVID-19. Almost all patients seem to recover a significant part of their smell and taste abilities in the first 4 months after the onset of symptoms.

N2  - ObjectiveTo identify the current clinical practices of Medicare-certified facilities offering ventricular assist devices as destination therapy and to attain a consensus of recommended clinical practices across the United States for the management of adults with ventricular assist devices as destination therapy.MethodSixty ventricular assist device coordinators from Medicare-certified centers were invited to participate in an online, 2-round Delphi survey. The surveys asked whether recommended practices are current practices and whether respondents always/agreed or never/disagreed with performing the recommended practice guidelines. Consensus was defined as 75% agreement. The clinical areas of focus were patient selection, preoperative preparation, postoperative care, infection control, nutrition, and patient discharge preparation. Practices were extracted from the advanced practice guidelines for HeartMate destination therapy and the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation's 2006 guidelines for the care of heart transplant candidates.ResultsRepresenting 21 states across the country, the first-round survey had a response rate of 57% (n = 34). The second-round survey had a response rate of 74% (n= 17), representing 28% of the 60 centers. Consensus was obtained for 122 practices. The dimension of patient selection?diagnostic tests and screening had the highest level of consensus (16%, n = 20), and the dimension of postoperative care?intermediate/intensive care unit dimension had the lowest level of consensus (3.3%, n = 4).ConclusionSurvey results identify a consensus of practices for the specific group of ventricular assist device coordinators who responded, but that consensus cannot be generalized to all ventricular assist device facilities. These results can, however, provide a foundation for further research leading to the development of standard-of-care practices for patients with ventricular assist devices as destination therapy.

N2  - Highway corridor surveys are becoming more difficult and expensive to carry out because of the need to minimize lane closures, traffic disruptions, and safety hazards posed to the surveyors and public. Roadway surveyors are at risk when working in the traffic corridor if they are unable to move with the flow of traffic. Safety for the traveling public is also a concern when lanes are closed or blocked by slow-moving vehicles. Costs for the placement of safety features to protect a survey crew can in some instances be greater than the cost of the survey itself. To mitigate these problems, a survey data acquisition tool is needed that can collect topographic and infrastructure information without disrupting traffic flow. Terrapoint has developed a novel kinematic laser scanning system that can be deployed on a passenger vehicle or small watercraft. Light-detection and ranging (LIDAR) digital imagery and video are collected from the survey platform while it is moving at traffic speeds. The system is georeferenced with a high-accuracy Global Positioning System?inertial measurement unit. Terrapoint's mobile LIDAR scanner has successfully surveyed existing highway corridors all over North America. It has also proven sufficiently accurate for scanning airport runway surfaces so as to predict areas where water will pool. Moving with the traffic flow and not requiring an escort, the system scans a 360Â° swath that includes the pavement surface and objects to the sides and above the survey vehicle.

N2  - Gaining accurate information on illicit drug use and policing in real-world settings is a challenge. This study examines the utility of a smartphone app (?Going Out In Sydney?) to prospectively follow up illicit drug use and policing encounters at music festivals and licensed entertainment precincts in Sydney, Australia. In all, 38 regular festival and licensed entertainment venue attendees used the app to log nights out over a 3-month period, including (1) where they went (eg, festival, nightclub), (2) the prevalence of illicit drug use, and (3) the incidence and nature of police encounters. A survey and interview were then conducted about the utility of the app. The app enabled rich data collection (n?=?353 entries) about illicit drug use and policing at both target settings. Follow-up surveys indicated that most participants were extremely satisfied with the ease of use of the app and privacy afforded, and compared with other data collection modes, such as paper-based logs and online surveys, rated the app the most desirable method of data collection. This suggests smartphone apps may be a viable option for future studies on illicit drug use and policing of drugs.

N2  - During the course of this paper we mobilise an ideal typical framework that identifies three waves of reduction within contemporary qualitative inquiry as they relate to key aspects of the sociological tradition. The paper begins with a consideration of one of sociology's key questions; namely how is social organisation possible? The paper aims to demonstrate how this question moves from view as increased specialisation and differentiation in qualitative methodology within sociology and related disciplines results in a fragmentation and decontextualisation of social practices from social orders. Indeed, the extent to which qualitative methods have been detached from sociological principles is considered in relation to the emergence of a reductionist tendency. The paper argues that the first wave is typified by conceptual couplings such as ?discourse and the subject?, ?narrative and experience?, ?space and place? and the second by ?activity type couplings? such as ?walking and talking? and ?making and telling? and then, finally, the third wave exemplified through auto-ethnography and digital lifelogging. We argue each of these three waves represent a series of steps in qualitative reduction that, whilst representing innovation, need to reconnect with questions of action, order and social organisation as a complex whole as opposed to disparate parts.

N2  - Through a large-scale national survey, this study provided the first comprehensive examination of podcast users in the United States from the perspectives of motivation and usage. It deepened our understanding of this new on-demand audio platform in the context of consumption drivers, behaviors, and competing media options. The results showed that entertainment, information, and audio platform superiority were the most important motivators for podcast consumption. In addition, motives were found to affect listening behaviors, including listening settings, width, depth, and routine of listening, and usage of competing audio media, such as regular radio, online radio, and streaming music. The findings revealed that podcasting is a distinct medium with unique characteristics rather than a mobile, on-demand extension of existing audio platforms like radio. Podcast consumption, especially on today?s complex media platforms, is multidimensional and should be measured from multiple aspects and examined in various settings.

N2  - Executive SummaryThe year 2020 will go down in the annals of history as the year of COVID-19, the year the whole world was left devastated. Even in 2021, countries are being ravaged by the virus, with no immediate end in sight. In fast-moving and uncertain situations, leaders face many questions for which they might not have any answers (Argenti, 2020). Therefore, the question is how leaders can manage the communication environment with clarity, consistency and empathy during this period of extreme disruption (Glinska, 2020). Crisis communication is generally defined as the accumulation and dissemination of information during crisis situations to alleviate the severity of the crisis. This study outlines and analyses the communication strategies and measures adopted by the management of one of the biggest manufacturing industries of the country, the Steel Authority of India Limited, Rourkela Steel Plant (RSP), during this ongoing COVID-19 crisis. A survey on the efficacy of the communication measures adopted by the management was conducted on 345 employees. The results showed a high level of support for all the implemented communication measures. Yet employees at the junior level articulated a need for better communication exchange with the top management. They perceived their voices as going unheard and sought additional communication channels connecting them to the highest authority. Considering the feedback received from the employees, additional communication measures were adopted. RSP?s Mass Contact Exercise was revived in an online format. A mobile app was developed containing all information and guidelines that an employee would need regarding precautions, prevention, testing and treatment of COVID-19. Quick and clear communication at every juncture let RSP tide through arguably the toughest pandemic period. Thus, it should always be ensured that appropriate communication channels are effectively implemented for vital information to reach every corner of the organization.

N2  - Highway construction occasionally takes place in remote locations, making its document management challenging especially when frequent document revisions occur. With the recent advancement of smartphones and tablets, Quick Response (QR) codes can provide project teams rapid and reliable access to up-to-date documents required for field operations. As a result, the use of QR codes can lead to a reduced need for traveling or meeting for document revisions, and reduce the amount of hardcopy documents and storage space. Despite the potential for significant benefits, there have been few studies aimed at assessing the feasibility of using QR codes in highway construction. In response, the objective of the study was to investigate the benefits of and barriers to using QR codes in highway construction for document management. To conduct the study, first a multi-step process was used, involving an online survey and interviews, with a goal of determining the status quo of highway construction in terms of document management and mobile information technology (IT). The results indicate that hardcopy documentation is still the most prevalent form of document management in highway construction, and hence there is an opportunity for implementing QR codes in conjunction with mobile IT. In the second part of the study, a time study using a real-world infrastructure project was conducted based on three activities: detail look up, specification check, and version check. As a result, the study found statistical evidence that using QR codes can lead to significant time savings.

N2  - This article addresses the cumulative effect of graduate migration and opportunities for career development. Using data from an online survey of 756 master?s-level graduates educated in China and the UK, it examines their geographical mobility patterns and reveals significant differences between Chinese students who graduated from domestic universities and those who were educated abroad. Spatial autocorrelation analysis shows that international returnees, who usually had more privileged family backgrounds, clustered in China?s highly developed core cities of the Bohai Economic Rim and Yangtze River Delta regions, such as Beijing and Shanghai, while domestic graduates tended to work and live in less affluent medium-sized cities around these regions. Women international graduates were more mobile than their men counterparts. Our results provide new evidence that draws attention to migration?s role in graduate career development opportunities and highlights inherent economic discrimination within China, which is perpetuated by the national residency permit systemÂ ? Hukou. The case of Chinese graduates shows that the mobility patterns of international and domestic graduates are influenced by and contribute to growing regional inequalities for career development in China.

N2  - Remote driving operations represents an area of growing promise to exercise human driving capability rather than replace it. Autonomous driving technology is often motivated towards removing humans from the control loop of driving but up to now, has not been able to fully realize such aims. This paper summarizes two experiments that were conducted to investigate viability aspects of emulated teledriving from the point of view of a teledriver and of telepassengers. In the first experiment, a test driver improved lateral lane conformance across a closed-course track after only a few laps while experiencing novel arrangements of live-filmed driving camera and display views. In the second experiment, acceptance ratings from online survey respondents showed prominent negative scores only after viewing simulated driving videos with up to 20x to 50x the steering angle error of a modeled tele-steering device. Together, these studies suggest plausibility for teledriving and promise for future human factors research in this area.

N2  - Safety planning, simply put, is a detailed, personalized, and practical plan that is created to protect oneself against an abusive (or potentially abusive) partner. Relying on self-reported data from an online survey of female college students from a state university in Texas, this study focuses on safety strategies centered around escape planning (e.g., whether or not students have a safe place to go, where they would go, and what they would take with them) as well as what factors influence this (e.g., prior experiences with intimate partner violence). Using bivariate analyses to determine any association between factors that influence various aspects of the safety planning process, a number of important findings are reported. The majority of students indicated that they had a safe place to go and this was most likely to be a family or friend?s residence. Additionally, most students noted that they would take what is typically discussed in safety planning strategies (e.g., money, cellular phone, keys, identification, and clothing). Students who reported lower levels of social support and prior exposure to parental domestic violence were more likely to report they did not have a safe place to go. These findings underscore the importance of expanding violence prevention activities on college campuses beyond sexual assault, with information provided to all students on safety planning.

N2  - The traditional innovation function, focusing on extrinsic motivations such as economic benefits and returns, has neglected the side of intrinsic values and public motivations for innovation function. Recent innovation examples in an era of mobile network and web-based information environment pursue open connected innovations such as open source movement and crowding source. Such open, collective and social innovations result from strong public motivation and trust network. Although previous studies argue the potential effects of intrinsic values on innovative attitude, research has not yet provided a comprehensive empirical evidence on how innovative attitude is associated with intrinsic and public motivations. Little empirical research remains for the impact of public motivations and intrinsic values on innovative attitudes. This study, relying on nationally represented survey (n = 3,188) in South Korea, explores an empirical link between public motivations and innovative attitudes to explore and allow new ideas. We found that public interest, empathy, altruism and job involvement facilitate innovative attitude to pursue and accept new ideas and suggestions. This implies that both intrinsic values (job enjoyment and satisfaction) and public motivations (public interests, empathy and altruism) are crucial factors to promote innovative attitudes. We also found strong non-linear relationships between satisfaction, trust and innovative attitude. We discuss implications for future innovation function of intrinsic and public motivations in terms of the process of social construction.

N2  - Smart speakers have the potential to support independent living and wellness among low-income senior housing (LISH) residents. The aim of this study was to examine and compare LISH residents? attitudes and perceptions toward smart speakers at two time points: before and after technology use (N?=?47). A descriptive survey was administered to ask questions about hedonic motivation, perceived ease of use, self-efficacy, perceived usefulness of some potential or existing smart speaker features, cost, and privacy. Participants were initially favorable toward using a smart speaker and its digital agent (e.g., Alexa) as a daily assistant and wellness tool. They especially liked the smart speaker?s potential functionality of detecting harmful events and notifying someone to receive immediate help. The comparison of pre- and post-use responses revealed non-significant declines in most items, with the exception of willingness to use Alexa as a reminder system (p?<?.01), asking Alexa for help (p?<?.01), and asking for help in using Alexa (p?<?.01). This finding may reflect confusion or frustration with the device among participants. We conclude with recommendations for the design of smart speakers specifically tailored to the needs of LISH residents.

N2  - The paper investigates the impacts and barriers posed by connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) for pedestrians with visual impairment. This study uses a customized web-based survey of visually impaired people from Canada and abroad. Collected data are used to estimate econometric models to identify the critical factors that affect the level of trust in CAVs and the preference for using CAVs from the visually impaired individuals? perspective. Separate models are estimated for Canadian and non-Canadian samples, as Canadian and non-Canadian participants show some differences in perception and positive attitude towards CAVs. The models reveal that the majority of the respondents prefer to get feedback and alerts from CAVs. Congenitally blind Canadians are less likely to trust CAVs, but non-Canadian congenital blinds tend to trust CAVs. The models also indicate that the respondents who experienced being near an accident with an electric vehicle (EV) are less likely to choose CAVs. Respondents who rely on mobile applications and technology-based devices for navigating purposes tend to trust CAVs. Blind people who rely on conventional navigation tools (e.g., white cane, guide dog, etc.) are less likely to be the users of CAVs. Gender effect is visible, as the female participants tend not to trust CAVs. In relation to policy recommendations, subsidies should be provided to various advocacy groups to offer orientation and mobility (O&M) training services, which are pivotal to educate how to use technology-based navigational services. Also, automobile manufacturers should be enforced to add acoustic vehicle alert systems (AVAS) to both EVs and CAVs.

N2  - The rise of Big Data in the social realm poses significant questions at the intersection of science, technology, and society, including in terms of how new large-scale social databases are currently changing the methods, epistemologies, and politics of social science. In this commentary, we address such epochal (?large-scale?) questions by way of a (situated) experiment: at the Danish Technical University in Copenhagen, an interdisciplinary group of computer scientists, physicists, economists, sociologists, and anthropologists (including the authors) is setting up a large-scale data infrastructure, meant to continually record the digital traces of social relations among an entire freshman class of students (N?>?1000). At the same time, fieldwork is carried out on friendship (and other) relations amongst the same group of students. On this basis, the question we pose is the following: what kind of knowledge is obtained on this social micro-cosmos via the Big (computational, quantitative) and Small (embodied, qualitative) Data, respectively? How do the two relate? Invoking Bohr?s principle of complementarity as analogy, we hypothesize that social relations, as objects of knowledge, depend crucially on the type of measurement device deployed. At the same time, however, we also expect new interferences and polyphonies to arise at the intersection of Big and Small Data, provided that these are, so to speak, mixed with care. These questions, we stress, are important not only for the future of social science methods but also for the type of societal (self-)knowledge that may be expected from new large-scale social databases.

N2  - The aviation industry continues to experience landing overruns at general aviation airports due in part to pilots touching down beyond the midpoint of the available runway. In some landing overruns, pilots were unaware that the midpoint was reached and nonetheless continued the landing instead of implementing a go-around/aborted landing procedure. Incident reports confirmed that forced landings were coupled with frequent overruns. Over the years airport operators and pilots have occasionally reported that knowing the location of the midpoint of runways would help them to minimize such accidents. There is a greater tendency for landing overruns at airports that primarily serve general aviation operations with runway lengths less than 4,200 ft in length and being utilized by student pilots and those pilots that primarily fly on the weekends only. In order to identify potential markings that could assist in mitigating this risk, the research team evaluated the design for and potential benefits of a marking placed at or near the midpoint of a general aviation runway that would inform pilots of the potential for an overrun/overshoot on a landing. The research team evaluated several preliminary prototype midpoint runway markings using stakeholder input and an online survey of pilots. The best performing marking was further evaluated in an aviation training device study and in field evaluations at six airports. The study results found that the numeric Â½ located to the left of the runway centerline provided pilots with useful information on the remaining length of runway.

N2  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to perform an in situ assessment of office seating habits that influence chair testing and design.Background: Many chair testing parameters were derived decades ago when the average weight of people within the United States was dramatically lower and the office work tasks less computer based.Method: For the study, 51 participants were randomly selected from Brazos Valley, Texas, businesses to participate in 8-hr assessments of office seating habits. Overall results were compared with current chair testing and design assumptions. Data were collected through written survey and through data logging of seat and back contact pressure and duration with the use of the X-SENSOR? pressure mapping device and software. Additionally, 1 day per participant of caster roll distance was recorded with the use of a caster mounted digital encoder. Participants were grouped by body mass index (BMI) and weight (BMI <35 and weight <102 kg or BMI >35 and weight >102 kg).Results: It was determined that a significant difference did exist between the groups in mean seat time per shift (p < .001), back cycles per shift (p < .002), seat cycles per shift (p < .01), and caster distance rolled per shift (p < .001).Conclusion: Several key parameters and assumptions of current chair test methods and design specifications may no longer be valid for the upper quartile of weight range of the current U.S. population.Application: The data collected in this study will enable engineers to determine whether revision of design standards for testing office seating for both normal weight and extremely obese workers is indicated.
