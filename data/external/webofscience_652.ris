AB  - This research investigates the impact of service failure severity on consumers' negative emotion (anger) and coping behaviors (revenge and avoidance) in the context of mobile application service failure. It also identifies the moderating role of technology anxiety on the relationship between service failure severity and blame attribution. The sample for this study consisted of users who had experienced a mobile application service failure in Taiwan. This study distributed online surveys to potential respondents via MySurvey, an online survey distribution platform. Seven hundred and thirty-one mobile application users participated in this study. This study adopted Structural Equation Modeling to test the research hypotheses. The results showed that service failure severity positively affected blame attribution and, thus, amplified the anger of negative emotion. Revenge and avoidance occurred. Technology anxiety had a moderating effect on the relationship between service failure severity and blame attribution.

AB  - Purpose This study investigates perceptions of the use of online tracking, a passive data collection method relying on the automated recording of participant actions on desktop and mobile devices, for studying information behavior. It scrutinizes folk theories of tracking, the concerns tracking raises among the potential participants and design mechanisms that can be used to alleviate these concerns. Design/methodology/approach This study uses focus groups composed of university students (n = 13) to conduct an in-depth investigation of tracking perceptions in the context of information behavior research. Each focus group addresses three thematic blocks: (1) views on online tracking as a research technique, (2) concerns that influence participants' willingness to be tracked and (3) design mechanisms via which tracking-related concerns can be alleviated. To facilitate the discussion, each focus group combines open questions with card-sorting tasks. The results are analyzed using a combination of deductive content analysis and constant comparison analysis, with the main coding categories corresponding to the thematic blocks listed above. Findings The study finds that perceptions of tracking are influenced by recent data-related scandals (e.g. Cambridge Analytica), which have amplified negative attitudes toward tracking, which is viewed as a surveillance tool used by corporations and governments. This study also confirms the contextual nature of tracking-related concerns, which vary depending on the activities and content that are tracked. In terms of mechanisms used to address these concerns, this study highlights the importance of transparency-based mechanisms, particularly explanations dealing with the aims and methods of data collection, followed by privacy- and control-based mechanisms. Originality/value The study conducts a detailed examination of tracking perceptions and discusses how this research method can be used to increase engagement and empower participants involved in information behavior research.

AB  - Accessibility revolves around building products, including electronic devices and digital content, so that diverse users can conveniently utilize them, irrespective of their capabilities. In recent years, the concept of touchscreen accessibility has gained a remarkable attention, especially within the considerable reliance on mobile touchscreen devices (MTDs) for information acquisition and dissemination as we witness nowadays. For users who are visually impaired, MTDs unlock different opportunities for independence and functioning. Thus, with the increasing ubiquity of MTDs and their potential extensive utility for all demographics, it becomes paramount to ensure that these devices and the content delivered on them are accessible. And while it might seem straightforward to achieve accessibility on MTDs, attaining this outcome is governed by an interplay between different elements. These involve platform (i.e., operating system) built-in support of accessibility features, content rendering modalities and structures pertaining to user needs and the peculiarities of MTDs as informed in standard accessibility guidelines, user studies uncovering preferences and best practices while interacting with MTDs, national legislations and policies, and the use of third-party devices such as assistive technologies. In this paper, mobile touchscreen accessibility for users who are visually impaired is surveyed with focus on three aspects: (1) the existing built-in accessibility features within popular mobile platforms; (2) the nature of nonvisual interaction and how users who are visually impaired access, navigate, and create content on MTDs; and (3) the studies that tackled different issues pertaining to touchscreen accessibility, such as extraction of user needs and interaction preferences, identification of most critical accessibility problems encountered on MTDs, integrating mobile accessibility in standard accessibility guidelines, and investigation of existing guidelines in terms of sufficiency and appropriateness.

AB  - Applying self-determination theory, this study investigates how users' tracking behaviors relate to self-determination in the use of smart wearables, which enhances their intrinsic motivation (i.e., enjoyment) to use the device across age groups. An online survey with 494 smartwatch users aged 18 to 76 shows that the frequency of fitness data tracking is positively related to competence, autonomy, and relatedness needs fulfillment; only need for autonomy is positively associated with enjoyment. Age moderates the mediating effect of autonomy on the relationship between tracking fitness data and enjoyment. The findings are discussed from theoretical and practical perspectives.

AB  - Users acceptance of innovative product appearance authoring tools based on Spatial Augmented Reality (SAR) is still limited due to their perception of a high technology complexity and a low performance/functionality of the current interaction systems. The integration of SAR technologies in professional design activities is still marginal, though many studies in this field have already proved their potential as supporting tools. To overcome this barrier, efficient means for interacting with the digital images projected onto the surfaces of real objects are essential. The aim of the current study is to respond to this demand by proposing and validating three UI configurations displayed by an unique and portable device embedded with a touch screen. These interface layouts, designed to cooperate with the output of the SAR system and to not affect the well-known benefits of its augmented environment, provide different types of visual feedback to the user by duplicating, extending or hiding the information already displayed by the projected mock-up. The experimental study reported here, performed with a panel of 41 subjects, revealed that accuracy, efficiency and perceived usability of the proposed solutions are comparable with each other and in comparison to standard desktop setups commonly used for design activities. According to these findings, the research simultaneously demonstrates (i) the high performances achieved by the touch device when coupled with a SAR system during the execution of authoring tasks, (ii) the capability of the projected mock-up to behave as an actual three-dimensional display for the real time rendering of the product appearance and (iii) the possibility to freely select according to the users preference, the design task or the type of product one of the three UI configurations without affecting the quality of the result.

AB  - A major challenge in web-based cross-cultural data collection is varying response rates, which can result in low data quality and non-response bias. Country-specific factors such as the political and demographic, economic, and technological factors as well as the socio-cultural environment may have an effect on the response rates to web surveys. This study evaluates web survey response rates using meta-analytical methods based on 110 experimental studies from seven countries. Three dependent variables, so-called effect sizes, are used: the web response rate, the response rate to the comparison survey mode, and the difference between the two response rates. The meta-analysis indicates that four country-specific factors (political and demographic, economic, technological, and socio-cultural) impact the magnitude of web survey response rates. Specifically, web surveys achieve high response rates in countries with high population growth, high internet coverage, and a high survey participation propensity. On the other hand, web surveys are at a disadvantage in countries with a high population age and high cell phone coverage. This study concludes that web surveys can be a reliable alternative to other survey modes due to their consistent response rates and are expected to be used more frequently in national and international settings.

AB  - Due to 'stay-at-home' measures, individuals increasingly relied on smartphones for social connection and for obtaining information about the COVID-19 pandemic. In a two-wave panel survey (N-Time2 = 416), we investigated associations between different types of smartphone use (i.e., communicative and non-communicative), friendship satisfaction, and anxiety during the first lockdown in Austria. Our findings revealed that communicative smartphone use increased friendship satisfaction over time, validating how smartphones can be a positive influence in difficult times. Friendship satisfaction decreased anxiety after one month, signaling the importance of strong friendship networks during the crisis. Contrary to our expectations, non-communicative smartphone use had no effects on friendship satisfaction or anxiety over time. Reciprocal effects showed that anxiety increased both types of smartphone use over time. These findings are discussed in the context of mobile media effects related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Specifically, this study examined the relationships that enhance hotel guests' experiences through hotel apps. Design/methodology/approach The measurement items were developed through extensive literature review. This study used a web-based survey to test an integrated model of the experiential value. With a total of 320 usable samples, partial least squares structural equation modeling was carried out to identify key "driver" constructs and validate the proposed model. Findings A significant relationship was found in the playfulness of hotel apps and hotel guests' cognitive and affective evaluations of the hotel apps, which positively influence hotel guests' satisfaction and their endorsement for the hotel apps. Hotel apps should create fun and entertainment features in the hotel apps so that the users of hotel apps can be enjoyable during their usage. In addition, providing hotel apps users with time saving and easy use of the hotel apps can affect their satisfaction and endorsement for the hotel apps. Originality/value This study confirmed the positive links among hotel apps users' experiential value, their cognitive and affective evaluation of the hotel apps, their satisfaction of using the hotel apps and their endorsement for the hotel apps. This study also revealed that hotel apps can be hotels' effective communication tool that enhances existing and potential customers' overall experiences.

AB  - Researchers attempting to survey refugees over time face methodological issues because of the transient nature of the target population. In this article, we examine whether applying smartphone technology could alleviate these issues. We interviewed 529 refugees and afterward invited them to four follow-up mobile web surveys and to install a research app for passive mobile data collection. Our main findings are as follows: First, participation in mobile web surveys declines rapidly and is rather selective with significant coverage and nonresponse biases. Second, we do not find any factor predicting types of smartphone ownership, and only low reading proficiency is significantly correlated with app nonparticipation. However, obtaining sufficiently large samples is challenging-only 5 percent of the eligible refugees installed our app. Third, offering a 30 Euro incentive leads to a statistically insignificant increase in participation in passive mobile data collection.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to analyse the determinants for digital divide in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) by considering inequalities in internet use and broadband subscriptions. The study considers 41 countries in the region which are geographically linked, and it allows for spatial interdependence. It also accounts for differences in demographic characteristics as well as social, political and economic infrastructure which affect ICT access and use. Globally, about half of the world's population is connected to the internet whereas the remaining half, i.e. about 3.8 billion people, are not (yet) connected. The problem is more severe in developing countries compared to developed countries; it is said to be unsatisfactory in SSA compared to other countries. We apply a spatial panel analysis using the spatial Durbin model (SDM) specifications for 451 observations from 2006 to 2016. Our estimation results show that there is a strong spatial interdependence among SSA, implying that internet access and broadband subscriptions in one country are affected by internet access and broadband subscriptions in another country, most likely due to spillover effects. Our results reveal that GDP per capita, gross capital formation, political stability, regulatory efficacy and electricity infrastructure directly affect the digital divide. Moreover, GDP per capita, population growth, government consumption, trade openness, and electricity infrastructure also indirectly affect the digital divide through spillover effects. Regarding policy implications we suggest that SSA governments should work closer together in ensuring internet openness and to increase the level of coordination between their countries in order to ensure digital inclusion in their countries.

Using administrative and survey data, we study the take up and impacts of one of the most popular digital loan products in the world, M-Shwari in Kenya. While 34% of those eligible for a loan take it, the loan does not substitute for other credit. The loans improve household resilience: households are 6.3 percentage points less likely to forego expenses due to negative shocks. Fintech tools can be a crucial way to improve financial access and household resilience.

AB  - Technological advancements and changes in online survey participation pave the way for new data collection methods. Particularly, the increasing smartphone rate in online surveys facilitates a re-consideration of prevailing communication channels to, for instance, naturalize the communication process between researchers and respondents and to collect more in-depth and high-quality data. However, so far, there is a lack of information on whether respondents are willing to undergo a change in communication channels. In this study, I therefore investigate respondents' willingness to participate in online surveys with a smartphone to have the survey questions read out loud (audio channel) and to give oral answers via voice input (voice channel). For this purpose, I employed two willingness questions - one on audio and one on voice channels - in the probability-based German Internet Panel (N = 4,426). The results reveal that a substantial minority of respondents is willing to participate in online surveys with a smartphone to have the survey questions read out loud and to give oral answers via voice input. They also show that the device used for survey participation and personality traits, such as conscientiousness and extraversion, play a role when it comes to respondents' willingness.

AB  - While it is clear that using a mobile device can interrupt real-world activities such as walking or driving, the effects of interruptions on mobile device use have been under-studied. We are particularly interested in how the ambient distraction of walking while using a mobile device, combined with the occurrence of simulated interruptions of different levels of cognitive complexity, affect web search activities. We have established an experimental design to study how the degree of cognitive complexity of simulated interruptions influences both objective and subjective search task performance. In a controlled laboratory study (n = 27), quantitative and qualitative data were collected on mobile search performance, perceptions of the interruptions, and how participants reacted to the interruptions, using a custom mobile eye-tracking app, a questionnaire, and observations. As expected, more cognitively complex interruptions resulted in increased overall task completion times and higher perceived impacts. Interestingly, the effect on the resumption lag or the actual search performance was not significant, showing the resiliency of people to resume their tasks after an interruption. Implications from this study enhance our understanding of how interruptions objectively and subjectively affect search task performance, motivating the need for providing explicit mobile search support to enable recovery from interruptions.

AB  - Lean and agile models of product development organize the flexible capacity to rapidly update individual products in response to customer feedback. Although agile operations have been adopted across numerous industries, neither the benefits nor the factors explaining when firms choose to become agile are validated and understood. We study these questions using data on the development of mobile apps, which occurs through the dynamic release of new versions into the mobile app marketplace, and the apps' customer ratings. We develop a structural model estimating the dependence of product versioning on (a) market feedback in the form of customer ratings against (b) project and work-based considerations, such as development timelines, scale economies, and operational constraints. In contrast to when they actually benefit from operational agility, firms become agile when launching riskier products (in terms of uncertainty in initial customer reception) and less agile when they are able to exploit scale economies from coordinating development over a portfolio of apps. Agile operations increase firm payoffs by margins of 20% to 80%, and interestingly, partial agility is often sufficient to capture the bulk of these returns. Finally, turning to a question of marketplace design, we study how the mobile app marketplace should design the display of ratings to incentivize quality (increasing app categories' average user satisfaction rates by as much as 22%).

AB  - We describe an exploratory investigation of a dynamic digital map, inspired by videogame design. Participants followed a novel route through an urban environment, using a custom map that presented directional information for off-screen landmark locations. Spatial orientation (pointing to remembered landmarks) in this group was compared to participants using a static version of the same custom map (without the directional cues) and an additional control group that used a static mobile map from the public domain. Participants using the dynamic map were most accurate in making egocentric orientation judgments, although groups did not appear to differ in their configural spatial knowledge. These data suggest that landmark persistence may help users to build more accurate on-line representations of their spatial orientation.

AB  - This longitudinal study examined the reciprocal relationship between parental active mediation, parent-child relationships, and children's problematic mobile phone use (PMPU). A sample of 258 primary school students in Beijing, China, completed self-report questionnaires at three time points, with a one-semester interval (a six-month gap) between each measurement wave. The cross-lagged model test results revealed that parental active mediation may help reduce children's PMPU, whereas the corresponding reverse path from PMPU to parental active mediation was nonsignificant. There was a reciprocal negative relationship between parent-child relationships and children's PMPU. Parental active mediation had a positive effect on parent-child relationships, yet the corresponding reverse path from parent-child relationships to parental active mediation was nonsignificant. Overall, this study described a dynamic picture of children's PMPU, suggesting both a parent-driven process and a child-driven process in the prediction of children's PMPU. Our findings provide theoretical and practical implications to prevent or reduce children's engagement in PMPU.

AB  - Cross-sectional studies have documented a positive association between academic procrastination and problematic mobile phone use (PMPU). However, the specific predictive direction has remained controversial and the potential mechanisms underlying the association have not been rigorously evaluated. According to Davis's cognitive-behavioral model, Brand et al.'s I-PACE model, and procrastination-related theories, academic procrastination and PMPU might have a reciprocal relationship and distraction cognitions might play a mediating role in this process. A total of 633 secondary school students completed three self-report questionnaires at three 6-month intervals over the course of 1.5 years. The cross-lagged panel model results showed that earlier academic procrastination positively predicted subsequent PMPU over time, but the reverse prediction was not stable. Furthermore, distraction cognitions played a mediating role in linking earlier academic procrastination and subsequent PMPU. These findings indicate that academic procrastination precedes PMPU with distraction cognitions as a potential mediator, which contributes to clarifying the controversial relationship and explicating the underlying mechanism. Overall, interventions for academic procrastination may be effective in reducing maladaptive cognitions associated with mobile phones and preventing adolescents from developing PMPU.

AB  - Firms can benefit immensely from participating in digital platform ecosystems-specifically, from the shared technological assets and market opportunities offered by the platform owner. Yet, while aligning with the platform ecosystem rules, each member must decide whether to specialize in a given platform ecosystem or across multiple platform ecosystems to capture these benefits. We examine two common patterns through which platform ecosystem members (i.e., complementors) specialize within and across platform ecosystems, and the relative impact on their market performance. We look at the high relative standing of the complementary product as a reflection of complementors' specialization in the given product category or platform ecosystem. We then theorize that having products with high relative standing in a single product category and a single platform ecosystem, together, diminishes complementors' market performance over time. Similarly, high relative standing in multiple platform ecosystems and multiple product categories, at the same time, adversely impacts the market performance. We find supportive evidence for our hypotheses, in a panel dataset of mobile app developers. This paper contributes to the burgeoning stream of research that investigates the trade-offs faced by complementors, suggesting that complementor strategies are more complex than simply trying to maximize market reach.

AB  - Online food delivery service has developed rapidly and expanded the boundaries of the catering industry. Being a food delivery rider in the gig economy attracts workers with the premises of flexibility and freedom. However, existing studies based on labor process theory revealed that freedom is fictitious. The study sheds light on how the individual rider finds meaning in their work from the mobility perspective. A mixed-method approach based on questionnaires, interviews, and mobile ethnography is applied. Findings showed that food delivery riders gain the experience of freedom in many aspects, from flexible working hours, body movement, immediate cash transfer to freedom from many other regulations. Being a rider represents a free lifestyle and a way to control one's fate. Yet, it is perceived as a transitional job. This study contributes to making connections between the mobility perspective and work-related studies.

AB  - We compare Internet and telephone survey responses across 27 European Union nations and two research contexts: one, a choice experiment of willingness to pay to avoid power outages, and the other, a public acceptance of energy infrastructure question. The various forms of survey mode effects and the challenges of survey mode choice are documented and developed in the context of statistical theory and an application to an economics survey. We find evidence that survey mode effects vary across research contexts, and to a lesser extent, across nations. We suggest that the degree of measurement bias may be varying between research contexts, for example based on the availability of a perceived socially correct response within a given context. Future survey-based research should evaluate the choice of survey mode in a context- and region-specific manner.

AB  - Adherent dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) includes between-session phone consultation to help clients generalize skills, solve problems during crises, and repair relationships. Despite benefits of phone consultation, it is frequently not implemented in outpatient settings. The perceived burden phone consultation places on providers is one of the most frequently cited reasons for its omission. The current study examined phone consultation in relation to providers' burnout using a cross-sectional design. We hypothesized that (1) DBT experience and support from peer consultation team members, including perceived team efficacy and shared coaching responsibilities, would be associated with lower rates of burnout and (2) higher numbers of crisis contacts and "other" contacts, but not noncrisis skills generalization contacts, would be associated with increased burnout. Participants were 65 DBT therapists who completed an anonymous survey online. Results suggest that both having more effective consultation teams and sharing phone consultation among team members were associated with decreased burnout. Additionally, more crisis contacts were found to be associated with higher burnout, whereas higher number of skills generalization calls was not. This study represents an important first step towards evaluating the impact of phone consultation on providers and highlights the importance of effective peer consultation in reducing therapist burnout.

AB  - Two of the most important developmental tasks in adolescence are developing autonomy and establishing relationships (i.e., friendships and romantic relationships). Self-socialization processes are relevant in mastering these developmental tasks. Mobile media are predestined as tools for such self-socialization: Their affordances-universality, private accessibility, and ubiquity-closely match the developmental needs of adolescents and no other media device is so deeply embedded in adolescents' daily lives. The present paper proposes a reciprocal relationship between mobile media and communication and mastery of developmental tasks. The results of a three-wave panel study (N = 503) point to a marginal role of mobile media and communication in developing autonomy and establishing relationships. Still, results suggest that developmental achievements enable adolescents to make sensible use of mobile media and communication in response to their current developmental stage.

AB  - The social currency, the existing potential resource in the social networks and communities of an individual, has become more significant in the era of information technology. Meanwhile, the rapid development of Internet service, especially its application on mobile devices, brings many new contents of prosocial behaviors (PBs), which benefits both individuals and communities. Specifically, social currency plays a positive role in promoting PB, forming positive personalities, promoting positive social adaptation, and contributing to human survival and social development. However, the theoretical research in this field still lags far behind the development of practice, and the research on the impact of social currency on PB remains exceedingly scarce. Grounded in the social exchange theory (SET), the present study collects a total of 497 WeChat user questionnaires, constructs a model for the influence mechanism of social currency on PB, and tests the hypothesis through hierarchical regression. According to the results obtained, it was found that the social currency is positively associated with PB, and users with a more social currency are more likely to act prosocially on their own. The PB of an individual is then influenced by the social currency generated through collective self-esteem (CS) so that the perception of CS can be considered as a mediating variable. Moreover, the communication network heterogeneity (CNH) moderates the above relationship, and the degree of heterogeneity will have different effects on the relationship of CS. The obtained conclusions enrich the previous theoretical results of PB and provided new insights for social managers to enhance the prosocial-related behaviors for the group, organization, and society.</p>

We find a significant and positive relationship between each type of ICT and bilateral exports, although the impacts vary depending on the type of technology. Our findings suggest that the effect of ICT use is larger for mobile phones and smaller for broadband. The impact on trade is greater for the exporter than for the importer. Mobile phones register the greatest effect for import countries in trade flows from high-income to low- and middle-income countries.

AB  - This study examines the effects of internet use, as part of digitalisation, on the performance of micro and small enterprises (MSEs) in Yogyakarta province. Using primary data on MSEs in Yogyakarta, the paper exploits conceivably exogenous variations in the cellular signal strength that MSEs receive to connect to the internet, once number of local cellular transmitters, location topography, local building and infrastructure development and sectoral characteristics are controlled. The findings show that internet use has enabled MSEs to engage in the digital economy and has improved labour productivity and exports. The associated monetary benefit due to internet use is substantial for local people.

AB  - This study employed a mixed methods approach (a survey [n = 2,774] and focus groups [n = 16]) to understand the perceptions of younger drivers (18-25) on current smartphone laws in the Australian state of Victoria. First, by analysing quantitative data gathered from an online survey regarding smartphone laws, perceptions of punishment when breaking the law, and attitudes to both the law and fines, this study found younger drivers were less likely to understand the law around phone use while driving, even after direct or indirect experience with police. Additionally, the severity and impact of fines were perceived as more impactful and severe among younger drivers, women, and those on lower incomes, and the most common types of illegal use younger drivers engaged with were navigation, music applications, and hands-free calling, mostly facilitated through Bluetooth with their device placed out of sight. Consequently, focus groups were conducted with a subset of these younger drivers to explore these findings in more depth. It was revealed that smartphone laws were perceived to be ambiguous, at times unreasonable, and difficult to access conclusive information regarding the law or receive information throughout the Graduated Licencing Program. Additionally, of full licenced drivers breaking smartphone laws (n = 807), 61.7 percent never used a cradle. Among probationary drivers breaking the law (n = 209), 76.1 percent never used a cradle. This suggests rampant surreptitious illegal use. As such, younger drivers learning to drive are also learning methods to avoid punishment while breaking smartphone laws. This included not using a cradle and opting instead for Bluetooth connectivity or engaging in hand-held use, a choice that continued into Full Licensed driving. The severity of punishment was not common knowledge and was perceived to be incommensurate to the risks associated with certain types of use. In their opinion all of these factors reduced the legitimacy of the law. Addressing these factors with evidence-based countermeasures may increase compliance and road safety.

AB  - 5G is considered a key technology for society but its implementation is currently surrounded by controversy. Beyond its technical aspects, 5G has become a question of security and national interest for many States as well as an international policy issue. Technological autonomy and digital sovereignty are increasingly recognised as strategic priorities on a global scale. In this context, the EU's position is unique, basically for two reasons. On the one hand, the EU has unintentionally become part of the playing field in the US-China dispute over technology companies and 5G. On the other hand, any policy of the EU or its Member States is constrained by the nature of 5G as an area of either European or national competence. The delimitation of their competences is not clear, just as there is no transparent and understandable distinction of their 5G responsibilities. In order to clarify this situation, a comprehensive analysis of the European competence and legal frameworks is necessary. After that, the study of the evolution process of this European policy provides an overview of its scope and limits. Finally, the paper explains the procedures and instruments of this European policy and concludes by assessing its implementation and development prospects. The possibility of reaching technological autonomy and digital sovereignty for the EU and its member states depends, for the time being, on this European policy.

AB  - The over usage and over dependency on digital devices, like smartphones, has been considered as a growing international epidemic. The increased dependency on gadgets, especially smartphones for personal and official uses, has also brought many detrimental effects on individual users. Hence it is vital to understand the negative effects of smartphone usage on human. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effects of bedtime smartphone usage on work performances, interpersonal conflicts, and work engagement, via the mediating role of sleep quality among employees. Using a cross-sectional study design, a questionnaire-based field survey was conducted on 315 employees who participated as respondents. The results confirmed the negative effects of bedtime smartphone usage on sleep quality. Along with it, the effects of sleep quality on work performances, work engagements and interpersonal conflicts were also proven to be statistically significant. Regarding the mediating role of sleep quality, it was empirically evident that sleep quality mediates the relationship between bedtime smartphone usage with work performances and interpersonal conflicts. The findings revealed that bedtime smartphone usage reduces sleep quality among the employees, resulting in lower work performances and engagements while contributing to higher interpersonal conflicts. The findings concluded that smartphone usage before sleep increases the prospects of employees to be less productive, less engaged, and have more workplace conflicts. The findings warrant the continued managerial as well as academic research attention, as the smartphones are now used by many organisations to run businesses as well.

AB  - Deviant behavior of adolescents in the online world has emerged as a serious social issue in South Korea. Given the urgent need to address new forms of risks related to technological advancement such as the Internet, this study examined the mechanisms of online deviant behavior among adolescents guided by general strain theory. Two waves of the nationally representative Korean Children and Youth Panel Study (N = 2184; M-age = 13.6 years) were used. The study examines whether the association between parental maltreatment (7(th) grade) and online deviant behavior (8(th) grade) is mediated by depression (8(th) grade), and further whether the mediating effect of depression (8(th) grade) on online deviant behavior (8(th) grade) is moderated by mobile phone dependency (8(th) grade). Depression mediated the relationship between parental maltreatment and online deviant behavior in the following year. A significant indirect and negative effect of parental maltreatment on online deviant behavior through depression was observed when levels of mobile phone dependency were low and moderate but not when mobile phone dependency was high. The findings demonstrated that adolescent's depression and mobile phone dependency represent a key mechanism in determining the association between parental maltreatment and online deviant behavior. However, these findings may not be applicable for youth with the highest levels of mobile phone dependency.

AB  - Digital tools hold great promise to promote agricultural transformation and benefit smallholder farmers in the developing world. One such tool is Uber for tractors, which aims to enable farmers to access tractor hire services in a way that is deemed similar to the Uber service for ride-hailing. While widely praised, Uber for tractors has not yet been rigorously analyzed. How does it work in practice? And what is its potential to reduce the transaction costs of tractor service provision, both for tractor owners and for smallholders who use tractor services? To answer these questions, we present case studies of two companies that apply digital tools in support of tractor hire: Hello Tractor in Nigeria and EM3 Agri-Services in India. A transaction costs economics framework was developed to identify how Uber for tractor tools can, in theory, influence the attributes of service hire transactions and, thus, reduce transaction costs. For the empirical analysis, a mixed-methods approach was applied involving approximately 400 respondents and comprising net-maps (a participatory mapping tool), focus group discussions, interviews with tractor owners and other stakeholders, and a survey among farmers. Our results show that the Uber for tractor models have indeed the potential to reduce transaction costs for service providers, in particular the owners of several tractors, by enabling the monitoring of tractors and operators through GPS devices. Farmers who access services have, so far, only indirectly benefitted from the new digital tools, because they still relied on "analog" solutions booking agents and phone calls rather than a smartphone app to request services. Overall, the paper shows that Uber for tractors is a pioneering concept, but investment in enabling conditions, such as digital literacy and network coverage, is required to harness the full potential of such digital innovations for smallholder farmers in the developing world.

AB  - Introduction: Youth nicotine dependence may vary by e-cigarette device used. Methods: E-cigarette device type ("JUUL," "similar pod/JUUL like device (i.e., pod mod)," or "other type of ecigarette" (i.e., tank, mod)), nicotine dependence (Hooked on Nicotine Checklist; HONC), frequency of e-cigarette use (i.e., weekly, daily, monthly), and covariates were examined via a convenience sample of youth who use e-cigarettes in the United States via an online Qualtrics panel survey from April 2019 to May 2019. Results: Youth aged 13-17 (Mean age = 15.9 years, SD = 1.0 year; n = 185) were mostly 72.4% female. Primary device used by category was endorsed as follows: JUUL n = 87, pod mod n = 42, and other type of e-cigarette n = 56. Participants endorsed an average of 4.5 / 10 HONC symptoms (SD = 3.6). Compared to other e-cigarettes, youth who used JUUL and pod mod devices endorsed more dependence symptoms, even when adjusting for current smoking status (JUUL IRR = 1.96, 95% CI 1.30-2.97; pod mod device IRR = 1.76, 95% CI 1.08-2.87). In total, HONC symptoms significantly differed by device for 8/10 symptoms, with JUUL and pod mod users reporting higher frequency of items compared to other e-cigarette devices. Conclusions: Features of nicotine dependence experienced by youth (i.e., feeling a stronger urge to vape) differed by primary device used, with those using JUUL and pod-mods reporting a greater level of dependence. Regulation of features of e-cigarette devices that may increase nicotine delivery and subsequent development of dependence among youth warrant urgent consideration.

AB  - An athlete's decision to use technology depends on trust in the automation, and confidence in their abilities. Distance measuring devices (DMD) are used in golf to estimate yardage. The purpose of these studies was to examine how DMD usage affects trust in the DMD, confidence in determining yardage manually, and golf performance over time. In study 1, DMD non-users played four rounds of golf, two with the DMD and two without. In study 2, DMD users played five rounds, three with the device, and two without. Participants' trust in automation, confidence, and performance were recorded by online survey at baseline and following each round. Giving a DMD to non-users influenced trust in automation and confidence. When DMD users relinquished the device, confidence decreased briefly but rebounded quickly, trust in automation was unaffected. Performance was unchanged in both groups. These studies provide information about how confidence in abilities and trust in automation interact.

AB  - We explored the relationship between being phubbed by one's peers and selfie liking, and examined the mediating effect of attention seeking and the moderating effect of gender in this relationship. An online survey was conducted with 427 university students. The results reveal that peer phubbing was positively related to attention seeking and selfie liking. Further, attention seeking was positively related to selfie liking, and attention seeking mediated the relationship between peer phubbing and selfie liking. The indirect pathways involved gender differences, with a stronger indirect effect formen compared to that for women. Thus, gender moderated the relationship between peer phubbing and attention seeking, as well as the relationship between attention seeking and selfie liking. These findings illustrate that selfie-related behaviors may function as a buffer for being phubbed. Moreover, phubbed individuals are prone to engage in attention-seeking behavior and frequent selfie liking.

AB  - Advances in information and communication technology (ICT) have provided a platform for the introduction and diffusion of a range of financial technologies that have transformed the financial sector. This study analyses the diffusion of financial technology (fintech) and its interaction with financial inclusion and living standards (GDP per capita). We consider the determinants and effects of technology diffusion in financial services and identify two possible transmission mechanisms from the financial sector to GDP per capita - a fintech diffusion channel and a financial inclusion channel. We specify the interactions between these two channels and their relationship with income per capita. Our empirical analysis focuses on the diffusion of two enabling fintech innovations: ATMs and associated digital networks; and mobile phones and payments systems. The relationships between fintech diffusion, financial inclusion and GDP per capita are estimated using a panel data set for up to 137 countries over the period 1991-2015 using both cross section and panel techniques, including an error correction model that distinguishes short- and long-run effects. A key finding is that fintech diffusion and financial inclusion have long-run effects on GDP per capita over and above their short-run impact and the effects of investment in fixed and human capital.

AB  - The study of mundane, everyday uses of the Internet remains an emerging field of inquiry. Analysing data from a large seven country survey of Internet use and adapting concepts and methods developed by Bourdieu, we show that there are distinct clusters of users who use the Internet in diverse ways to solve everyday problems, such as buying a mobile phone or diagnosing an illness. Such everyday problem-solving is dependent upon degrees of economic, social, digital and cultural capital, and varies across countries. A comparative methodological strategy combined the use of multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), and for the first time in the field, multiple factor analysis for contingency tables (MFACTs). Extending the work of Bourdieu and the sociology of class more generally, we argue that digital capital functions as a bridging capital aiding the convertibility of other forms of capital to the benefit of already advantaged groups.

AB  - Objective: Providing instruction for assembly tasks is essential in modern manufacturing industry, as well as in households for customers that buy products to be assembled at home. Recent technological developments might be able to assist in completing an assembly task faster and more accurately. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether performance and usability differs when instructions for an assembly task are presented on digital glasses versus paper.
   Methods: Participants (n = 63) completed one of three versions of an assembly task (between-subject-design) with LEGO (R) bricks: (1) with paper instruction (P), (2) with text instructions presented stepwise via digital glasses (GT), (3) with stepwise text and auditory instruction (in parallel) on digital glasses (GA). Outcome measures on performance were completion time and errors. Furthermore, usability was measured by the User Experience Questionnaire, the Standardized Usability Questionnaire, the Post-Study Usability Questionnaire, and cognitive processing skills were assessed by the Trail Making Test and different versions of the Eriksen Flanker Task. Analyses were adjusted for the confounding factors age, gender, experience with glasses and LEGO, and problems with instruction. Results: Findings indicate that task completion was faster with the paper instructions compared to both versions of instruction via digital glasses (GT, GA). We observed no difference in accuracy and usability between the instructions. "Novelty" was rated higher for instructions for both GT and GA, compared to P.
   Discussion: Results show that instructions on digital glasses may not always be more effective for assembly than the traditional paper-based instructions. Further studies are necessary to investigate whether effectiveness may depend on task complexity, target group, experience of the user with task and device, and how the information is presented.

AB  - Recruiting participants through gatekeepers has been widely discussed in qualitative research. However, when a sampling frame is not available, surveying through gatekeepers can also be important for quantitative studies. We used three sampling methods to survey guardians of University students: (a) a gatekeeper variant of the time-space sampling, (b) a direct postal survey to a random sample of guardians' addresses, and (c) a phone survey of the general population. The gatekeeper survey was the most efficient, but yielded a skewed sample. Albeit skewed, the gatekeeper sample yielded the same responses as the random sample, on five theoretically important scales (N = 29 questions). In-depth personal interviews and online semi-structured questionnaires with guardians and students revealed a two-way gatekeeping mechanism within families, regulating guardians' participation in the study. We discuss the indispensable contribution of qualitative data in our study and provide methodological suggestions for practitioners.

AB  - Media usage is pervasive in young children and in parents. The aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of media usage on family functioning. To measure media usage we used the Media Usage Questionnaire (MUQ). To measure the family functioning we used the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales (FACES IV), in which balanced scores (cohesion and flexibility) reveal a healthy functioning, and unbalanced scores reveal a dysfunctional functioning (disengagement, enmeshment, rigidity and chaos). Both instruments were administered to a sample of 80 families with children aged from 1 to 8 years. Results indicated that family functioning was balanced when both parents and young children showed low levels of digital device usage, whereas family functioning was dysfunctional when parents showed high levels of media usage and they allowed children high usage too. The results are discussed in terms of implications for the analysis of risk of altered family functioning.

AB  - Failure in organizations is very common. Little is known about whether leaders should provide information about past organizational failure to followers and how this might affect their future performance. We conducted a field experiment in which we recruited temporary workers to carry out a phone campaign to attract new volunteers and randomly assigned them to either receive or not to receive information about a failed mail campaign pursu-ing the same goal. We find that informed workers performed better, regardless of whether they had previously worked on the failed mail campaign or not. Evidence from a second field experiment with students asked to sup-port voluntarily a campaign for reducing food waste corroborates the finding. We explore the role of leadership tactics behind our findings in a third online survey experiment. We conclude that information about past failure is unlikely to have a negative impact on work performance, and might even lead to performance improvement. Implications for future research on the relevance of leadership tactics when giving such information are discussed.

AB  - The effects of scale direction on response behavior are well known in the survey literature, where a variety of theoretical approaches are discussed, and mixed empirical findings are reported. In addition, different types of survey completion devices seem to vary in their susceptibility to scale direction effects. In this study, we therefore investigate the effect of scale direction and device type on response behavior in PC and smartphone surveys. To do so, we conducted a web survey experiment in a German non-probability access panel (N=3,401) using a two-step split-ballot design with four groups that are defined by device type (PC and smartphone) and scale direction (decremental and incremental). The results reveal that both PCs and smartphones are robust against scale direction effects. The results also show that response behavior differs substantially between PCs and smartphones, indicating that the device type (PC or smartphone) matters. In particular, the findings show that the comparability of data obtained through multi-device surveys is limited.

AB  - Self-regulated learning (SRL) is useful for understanding self-directed learning practices. However, SRL behaviours - despite being deemed highly context-dependent - remain mostly unexplored for healthcare workers in low-income countries. This study details how SRL strategies vary and impact on healthcare providers' learning gains when using digital learning platforms. We apply Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) to questionnaire responses from a sample of 264 healthcare providers, arguably the first time LPA has been applied for the context in this subject-domain. We identified four SRL profiles: High, Above-Average with Low Help-Seeking, Average, and Low SRL profiles with significant differences in SRL strategies between the four profiles confirmed by Kruskal-Wallis test and logistic regression. Healthcare providers with more specialised clinical training were most likely to be in the Low SRL profile, but compared to the other profiles, maximised possible learning gains in the fewest learning iterations. From our findings, SRL may not adequately represent the nature of the interaction between these learners and contextual characteristics. Exploring the important role of various external learning regulation behaviours that influence healthcare providers SRL might help address this shortcoming. These findings provide insights into the learner factors to consider when implementing technology-mediated learning in these resource-contexts. They also offer plausible future research directions into how to maximise healthcare providers' learning gains on digital platforms that is informed by how learners in low-income contexts regulate their self-directed learning.

AB  - Consumers are increasingly using technologies such as wearables or mobile apps to achieve their self-improvement goals. Such technologies often contain features that enable social interdependence (competition or cooperation) among users to support them in improving their engagement, performance, and well-being (life satisfaction and personal growth). However, the critical question remains: does competition or cooperation best serve users in attaining these self-improvement goals? Evidence from an online experiment and a field study reveals that competition is more effective in driving performance and personal growth, while cooperation is superior in terms of behavioral engagement and life satisfaction. Furthermore, the results indicate that the effects are mediated by strive for success and fear of failure, two counteracting psychological processes. While competition is the stronger trigger for both pathways, downstream effects vary depending on the self-improvement goal considered. This research thus provides insights into whether and how users can best realize their self-improvement goals using technologies that include social features. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Whether mobile phones benefit or sabotage close relationships has been a persistent subject of debate in media and communication studies. Because previous studies have demonstrated contrasting findings, further studies on this topic are required. Based on media richness theory and social penetration theory, this study investigated the direct and indirect associations between mobile communication and relationship quality (i.e., depth, support, and conflict) in romantic relationships. A survey of 1,000 university students in China revealed that relationship depth was positively predicted by mobile phone calls and negatively predicted by mobile short messages. Mobile WeChat had dialectical effects, as it reinforced relationship depth and support, but increased conflict. Regarding indirect effects, communication quality online positively mediated the effects of mobile phone calls on relationship quality and negatively mediated the effects of mobile short messages and Weibo on relationship quality. Moreover, passionate love attitudes (PLAs) and gender negatively moderated the effects of mobile phone calls on relationship depth, indicating that females and individuals who had stronger PLAs had lower relationship quality when they used mobile phone calls to interact with their romantic partners. The moderating effects of PLA were extended to the indirect relationship between phone calls and relationship quality through communication quality. Overall, this study developed a typology to examine mobile relational communication by integrating the quantity (i.e., mobile use frequencies) and quality of mobile communication, as well as personal attitudes in close relationships.

AB  - The mitigation hierarchy (MH) is a prominent tool to help businesses achieve no net loss or net gain outcomes for biodiversity. Technological innovations offer benefits for business biodiversity management, yet the range and continued evolution of technologies creates a complex landscape that can be difficult to navigate. Using literature review, online surveys, and semi-structured interviews, we assess technologies that can improve application of the MH. We identify six categories (mobile survey, fixed survey, remote sensing, blockchain, data analysis, and enabling technologies) with high feasibility and/or relevance to (i) aid direct implementation of mitigation measures and (ii) enhance biodiversity surveys and monitoring, which feed into the design of interventions including avoidance and minimization measures. At the interface between development and biodiversity impacts, opportunities lie in businesses investing in technologies, capitalizing on synergies between technology groups, collaborating with conservation organizations to enhance institutional capacity, and developing practical solutions suited for widespread use.

AB  - In recent years, the new media have become so attractive that they are used for meetings, entertainment, and work. People more and more often use Facebook or phones instead of doing their work or family duties. The main aim of the present study was to test the mediating role of future anxiety in the relationship between procrastination and problematic new media use. The participants were students (N = 478), aged 18 to 27 (M = 19.93, SD = 1.77); 64% of the sample were women. The General Procrastination Scale, the Decisional Procrastination Scale, the Facebook Intrusion Questionnaire, the Adapted Mobile Phone Use Habits, and the Future Anxiety Scale-Short Form were used. The study showed that those students who procrastinated often reported a high tendency to engage in problematic new media use and a high level of future anxiety. The findings of the study have important implications for research on problematic Facebook and mobile phone use. They may be applicable in the work of psychologists, psychiatrists, and therapists, both in prevention and in developing online addiction therapies.

AB  - The aim of the study is to document how academics who mother have reorganized work and childcare since the beginning of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in the United States, how those shifts have affected their academic productivity, and solutions proposed by academics living these experiences. We collected data via an online survey and, subsequently, by conducting qualitative interviews with a subsample of participants. From June to August 2020, 131 female-identified academics who mother were recruited via a Facebook group, Academic Mamas, and participated in our online survey. Twenty participants were then interviewed via phone or Zoom to explore more deeply the experiences of academics who mother. Results of our research suggest that since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the pressure on academics who mother is immense. Analysis of the qualitative data revealed three major themes: (1) inability to meet institutional expectations; (2) juggling work and family life; and (3) proposed solutions. Our results suggest that significant efforts must be made by academic institutions to acknowledge and value the childcare responsibilities of academics who mother and to create solutions that fully address the challenges they face in meeting the academic expectations and requirements that largely remain unmodified despite the pandemic.

AB  - Most existing research assumes "phone use during face-to-face interactions" to be psychosocially detrimental. Drawing on the digital social multitasking framework, this study explored not only the negative but also positive implications of the behavior. A sample of 517 adolescents (M-age = 14.83, S.D. = 1.93; 50% female) recruited through the Qualtrics panel completed an online survey. Results showed that adolescents' and their friend's digital social multitasking were both associated with (1) greater perceived efficiency, which, in turn, was associated with competence need satisfaction, and (2) greater perceived connection, which, in turn, was associated with better friendship quality, autonomy need satisfaction, and relatedness need satisfaction. Adolescents' own multitasking also had an indirect, negative relationship with friendship quality through perceived distraction, but friend's multitasking did not compromise friendship quality. The study provides a more balanced picture, showing that despite the potential harm of digital social multitasking, adolescents' phone use during face-to-face peer interactions also involves potential benefits for teens' psychosocial well-being.

AB  - Previous research shows that the direction of rating scales can influence participants' response behavior. Studies also suggest that the device used to complete online surveys might affect the susceptibility to these effects due to the different question layouts (e.g., horizontal grids vs. vertical individual questions). This article contributes to previous research by examining scale direction effects in an online multi-device survey conducted with panelists in Spain. In this experiment, respondents were randomly assigned to two groups where the scale direction was manipulated (incremental vs. decremental). Respondents completed the questionnaire using the device of their choosing (57.8% used PCs; 36.5% used smartphones; and 5.7% used tablets). The results show that scale direction influenced response distributions but did not significantly affect data quality. In addition, our findings indicate that scale direction effects were comparable across devices. Findings are discussed and implications are highlighted.

AB  - The role of working memory (WM) components, such as phonological loop, in online inferential processing has thus far not been empirically examined with a dual-task paradigm. The current study used an online method to examine the effects of the two components of phonological loop-the articulatory rehearsal device and the phonological store device-on online causal inference generation during Chinese text reading. Eighty-five Chinese university students read three-sentence inference and control texts and responded to comprehension questions related to targeted inferences in different reading conditions. The results showed that in the articulatory suppression condition, response times (RTs) for comprehension questions of inference texts were considerably longer, and response errors were significantly higher than those in the normal reading condition, which indicated the effects of the articulatory rehearsal device on readers' online causal inference processes during Chinese text reading. Moreover, RTs for comprehension questions of inference texts in the irrelevant speech condition were significantly shorter than those in the normal reading condition, suggesting effects of the phonological store device on readers' causal inference processes during reading. Taken together, these findings indicate that the articulatory rehearsal device plays an important role in inference processes, but readers allocate more cognitive resources to facilitate the construction of causal relations during text-based inferential comprehension when function of the phonological store device is impaired.

AB  - This study aims to determine the factors that influence user intention to use location-based emergency applications. The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) is used as a fundamental theory by adding other relevant variables: trust, privacy concern, and fear of crime. Data were collected through questionnaires distributed to the users of the X-Igent Panic Button application. A total of 348 data were collected online using random sampling and processed using structural equation modeling. This study concludes that this application adoption's determinant factors are performance expectancy, trust, social influence, fear of crime, and collection as privacy concerns. These factors become significant predictors of behavioral intention by explaining about 60.5% of the total variation. The study also concludes that trust in services or service providers has the most significant positive impact on the behavioral intention to use location-based mobile applications in emergencies.

AB  - Although the increasing mobile technology applies in our daily lives, there remain questions that clearly illustrate the experience inspired by the mobile technology environment. It is theoretically and practically meaningful to systematically reveal how mobile technology generates users' virtual experience and, subsequently, the behavioral response. To fill the gaps, drawing on the Stimulus-Organism-Response model, this paper regards flow as the core experience based on the features of the mobile users' experience. The framework is that mobile technology will promote users' virtual experience, and in turn, affect their behavioral response. This study uses online survey data from 452 respondents. We employ the structural equation model based on the partial least squares method and further mediation analysis by the Sobel test to validate the research hypotheses. Our results show that the mobile technology environment has a significantly positive effect on users' purchase intention/return mediated by the virtual experience. However, the direct relationship between ubiquity and flow, as well as telepresence and intention to purchase/return, are not significant. Finally, a few theoretical and managerial contributions are also discussed.

AB  - Urban regions are complicated functional systems that are closely associated with and reshaped by human activities. The propagation of online geographic information-sharing platforms and mobile devices equipped with the Global Positioning System (GPS) greatly proliferates proximate sensing images taken near or on the ground at a close distance to urban targets. Studies leveraging proximate sensing images have demonstrated great potential to address the need for local data in the urban land-use analysis. This paper reviews and summarizes the state-of-the-art methods and publicly available data sets from proximate sensing to support land-use analysis. We identify several research problems in the perspective of examples to support the training of models and means of integrating diverse data sets. Our discussions highlight the challenges, strategies, and opportunities faced by the existing methods using proximate sensing images in urban land-use studies.

AB  - Contemporary audiences have abundant access to news anywhere, anytime and through a wide range of media. Due to the short length of news items, they do not require prolonged attentional focus. Consequently, the genre is consequential for performing simultaneous activities, which are related (i.e. second screening) or unrelated (i.e. media multitasking) to the content of the news items. Despite the potential of second screen activities to increase the political participation of young people, and the fact that adolescents are heavy users of digital media, there is almost no data on the extent to which they perform such activities. Also, there are almost no comparative data about the rates of news video consumption of adolescents vs. adults.
   This descriptive study analyzes how adolescents and adults consume news video content in an era of second screens. For four consecutive days, subjects reported their viewing behaviors using a dedicated mobile application. Results demonstrate that adolescents consume significantly less news video content compared to adults; smartphones occupy a more prominent role in their news consumption behavior compared to adults; and they are significantly more involved in Second Screening activities. Implications of the findings for understanding adolescents' contemporary media ecology are examined.
   Impact Summary
   (a) Prior State of Knowledge
   Young people are the primary age group that consumes news content mainly on digital platforms, and simultaneously performs multitasking and second screening activities.
   (b) Novel Contributions
   Adolescents' consumption habits are significantly different from those of adults: they consume less news, the smartphone occupies a more prominent role in their news consumption behavior, and they are significantly more involved in second screening activities.
   (c) Practical implications
   The question of how adolescents consume news content has sparked significant interest of scholars and parents alike. As adolescents are in a developmental stage in which they socialize and acquire habits that will affect them later in life, an understanding of their media consumption habits can have significant consequences contemporarily, and possibly at later stages in their lives. The paper provides novel insights about adolescents' news consumption patterns.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION
LA  - English
AB  - The study attempts to identify the influential antecedents of customer satisfaction and repatronage intentions in the context of e-grocery retailing through mobile applications. Literature survey based on qualitative thematic approach was adopted for the study. The reviewed articles were selected based on Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) framework. The model was subjected to reliability and validity determination through Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). The hypotheses were tested through Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). SEM results revealed that out of the four proposed antecedents i.e. online tracking, design aesthetics, online rating & review, and perceived security risk, the initial three bear significant positive causal relationship with customer satisfaction. The existing study gives a perspective of e-grocery retailing based mobile applications in an emerging market, which is a departure from the past studies which are based on developed markets characterized by higher technology penetration and awareness amongst inhabiting populace.

AB  - With the increasing importance of online information environments, researchers have started investigating direct measures of online media use, such as online tracking. Most existing studies using tracking data have so far relied on commercial solutions, but these have limitations in terms of their costliness, replicability, and applicability to certain research questions. Hence, different research groups are developing their own tracking solutions for academic purposes. In this paper, we provide a critical review and classification of the existing approaches, apt to guide research decisions on the appropriate tracking approach and tool. First, we develop criteria to distinguish different user-centric desktop and mobile tracking approaches and tools (types of information, technical complexity, privacy implementation, user experience, and availability). Second, we describe different tools and approaches - separately for desktop and mobile tracking - with concrete examples and evaluate them using the aforementioned criteria. Finally, we discuss how different mobile and desktop tracking solutions can complement each other and provide recommendations for future research.

AB  - This research contributes to the debate about the relevance of Industry 4.0 technologies in improving environmental performance in the manufacturing industry. We employed a qualitative-quantitative approach in which 19 Italian operations managers were interviewed and 260 managers responded to an online questionnaire. The effects of various technologies were ranked using ordinal regression. Comments and suggestions gave context to the quantitative results. Sensors, radio-frequency identification, artificial intelligence and analytics were found to be most relevant in improving environmental performance, whereas simulation software contributed moderately. Additive manufacturing, cobots, robots, automated mobile robots and automated guided vehicles had a negative effect, augmented reality had no effect and other technologies indirectly affected environmental performance. We also found a lack of knowledge and application as well as scepticism about technologies such as artificial intelligence and augmented reality. Finally, there was concern about the disposal of electrical and electronic waste produced by these technologies.

AB  - (Future) teachers should acquire skills in sourcing science-related information online, so they can use evidence appropriately in their pedagogical practice. To successfully use such evidence, it is vital that teachers critically question their selection of online information. Based on findings from collaborative learning, we hypothesized that collaboration promotes teachers' critical elaboration of their selection of online educational information. Additionally, collaboration allows for social comparison and may thus impact teachers' self-efficacy in seeking information. In a 2 x 2 mixed-design study with the between-participants factor reasoning (individual vs. collaborative) and the within-participants factor self-reported information seeking self-efficacy (pre vs. post the reasoning task), each of N = 83 future teachers individually sought online information regarding the educational use of mobile phones in classrooms. This constituted a realistic search on the Internet, in a natural setting. Based on each participant's particular search, s / he was asked to select the online sources that s / he perceived relevant for reasoning whether mobile phones should be used in class. To foster reflection on how they selected information, participants were asked either to reason individually (individual group, n = 33) or to chat collaboratively (collaboration group, n = 50 in 25 dyads) about their selections. Participants in both groups reported higher information seeking self-efficacy after the reasoning task. Yet participants who collaboratively reflected on their selections more frequently showed elaborated reasoning behavior, than did participants in the individual group. Nonetheless, participants in both groups referred to certain criteria that guided their selection (i. e., criteria related to the information, the provider of information, or media) with the same frequency. Considering the potential benefits and challenges of collaboration, we discuss the findings in terms of how to promote future teachers' ability to critically reflect on their selection of online educational information.

TI  - Examining the Impact of a Survey's Email Timing on Response Latency, Mobile Response Rates, and Breakoff Rates
T2  - FIELD METHODS
LA  - English
AB  - The proportion of web survey responses submitted from mobile devices such as smartphones is increasing steadily. This trend presents new methodological challenges because mobile responses are often associated with increased breakoffs, which, in turn, can increase nonresponse bias. Using data from a survey of college students with more than 20,000 respondents, response patterns are examined to identify which days and times the survey invitation and reminder emails were most likely to produce nonmobile responses. The findings provide guidance on the optimal timing for recruiting college student sample members via email to reduce their likelihood of responding from a mobile device, and potentially, breaking off.

TI  - A Study on the Influencing Factors of Mobile Digital Music Selection in Subhealthy People Based on Perceived Value Theory
T2  - WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
LA  - English
AB  - Background. The mode of combining mobile terminals and mobile digital music has gradually entered a bottleneck period while promoting the development of the mobile terminal industry. Proposing personalized solutions for specific groups of people including subhealthy people has become the current direction for the further long-term development of this mode. Understanding the influencing factors that affect subhealthy people's selection of mobile digital music is an urgent problem that needs to be solved in the development of personalized solutions. Objective. This article analyzes the influencing factors of the purchase intent to buy mobile digital music for subhealthy people and provides suggestions for mobile terminal vendors on how to design personalized solutions for this group of people. Methods. In order to achieve the above goals, this article constructs an influencing factor model based on the theory of perceived value, collects data by means of questionnaires, and uses the method of structural equations to verify the proposed model. Results. The results show that perceived quality, perceived price, social value, and emotional value all have a significant effect on users' purchase intention. Meanwhile, the conditional value and epistemic value have a negative moderating effect on the relationship between the social value and subhealthy people's digital music purchase intention but strengthen the positive relationship between the emotional value and subhealthy people's digital music purchase intention. Conclusions. The analysis shows that mobile terminal vendors should have their own unique attitudes and feelings when designing personalized mobile digital music solutions for subhealthy people, clarify their position, find strategies to improve the experience of subhealthy people, and win the reputation of subhealthy people. Let subhealthy people have a sense of belongingness.

KW  - parent-child turn-taking
AB  - Digital media (DM), such as cellphones and tablets, are a common part of our daily lives and their usage has changed the communication structure within families. Thus, there is a risk that the use of DM might result in fewer opportunities for interactions between children and their parents leading to fewer language learning moments for young children. The current study examined the associations between children's language development and early DM exposure.
   Participants: Ninety-two parents of 25months olds (50 boys/42 girls) recorded their home sound environment during a typical day [Language ENvironment Analysis (LENA)] and participated in an online questionnaire consisting of questions pertaining to daily DM use and media mediation strategies, as well as a Swedish online version of the MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory, which includes a vocabulary scale as well as a grammar and pragmatics scale.
   Results: Through correlations and stepwise regressions three aspects of language were analyzed. The child's vocabulary was positively associated with interactional turn-taking. The child's vocabulary and grammar were negatively associated with the likelihood of parent's device use during everyday child routines and the amount of TV watched by the child. The child's pragmatic development was also positively associated with the parent's device use in child routines but also with the parent's joint media engagement (JME), as well as the child's gender (where girls perform better).
   Conclusion: Our study confirms that specific aspects of the 2-year old's DM environment are associated with the child's language development. More TV content, whether it is viewed on a big screen or tablet, is negatively associated with language development. The likelihood of parents' use of DM during everyday child routines is also negatively associated with the child's language development. Positive linguistic parental strategies such as interactional turn-taking with the child, JME, and book reading, on the other hand, are positively associated with the child's language development.

Design/methodology/approach The study is based on an online survey with students from an international business school located in southwestern China. The sample population for the study included randomly selected 600 university students who are active mobile phone users. A total of 470 questionnaires were returned; 456 were valid (14 were invalid due to the incompleteness of their responses), providing a response rate of 65%. Findings Social norms have the largest impact on user experience quality, followed by personalization and privacy awareness. User involvement in mobile recommendation systems has mediating effects on the above relationships, with larger effects on pull-based systems than on push-based systems. Originality/value This study provides an integrated framework for researchers to measure the effects of social, personal and risk factors on the quality of user experience. The results enrich the literature on user involvement, mobile recommendation systems and UX. The findings provide significant implications for both retailers and developers of mobile recommendation systems.

AB  - Populist parties are often argued to be very skilled in using digital media to attract supporters and strengthen linkages with their followers. However, only rarely has research shown this linkage empirically. This study explores whether arguments about the relation between digital platforms and populist voting can be substantiated using comparative survey data in France, Germany and Italy. Digital media include a variety of online platforms that can affect populist vote in different ways. This article addresses the relation between the political use of digital platforms and the populist vote. First, it looks at how the use of Social Networking Sites (SNS) and Mobile Instant Messaging Services (MIMS) is related to voting for populist parties. Second, it assesses whether the role of digital platforms is different for supporting digital 'immigrant' and digital 'native' populist parties. Third, it explores country differences in the relation between SNS and MIMS' use and the populist vote. Using original online surveys, the article shows that political activities on SNS and MIMS platforms (sending messages or posting, discussing or convincing others to vote for a candidate) increase the probability of voting for populist parties. However, it also finds that the political use of digital media is associated with the populist vote under certain (and limited) circumstances, that is only for a subset of populist parties. Finally, it identifies important differences in how SNS and MIMS are linked to the populist vote in countries presenting diverse institutional features, web regulations and constellations of media systems.

AB  - Young drivers exhibit high levels of risky driving behaviour, including texting while driving (TWD). The aim of this study was to examine the influence of personality (rash impulsivity, reward seeking), fear of missing out (FOMO) and mobile phone involvement (MPI) on frequency of TWD. Six hundred and twelve young drivers aged 17 to 24 years completed an online survey including these measures, and frequency of sending and reading TWD in the prior week. Rash impulsivity and reward seeking, as well as MPI, predicted both modes of TWD, while FOMO only predicted sending. In addition, rash impulsivity, reward seeking and FOMO all had significant indirect effects on sending and reading TWD via MPI. Findings highlight the importance of considering indirect relationships of personality via MPI on phone use while driving.

Drawing on trust-based acceptance model (i.e. cognitive and emotional trust) and online review features (i.e. profile photo, linguistic style, and reported experience), we examine how these factors affect trust in mobile social commerce. Hypotheses were tested using survey data. The results of our model showed that there are significant influences of profile photo, reported experience, cognitive, and emotional trust towards trust in ms-commerce. This work contributes to existing literature by examining the roles of previous trust in mobile payments and online reviews on trust in mobile social commerce.

AB  - Rapid increases in young people's time spent using digital technology ("screen time") in the mobile internet era have led to anxiety about long-term effects. This mixed-method US study examines childhood experiences and contextual factors that shape screen time in the transition to adulthood. We recursively analyzed 56 qualitative interviews with young adults in a large metropolitan area in 2016-2018 and prospective longitudinal nationally representative survey data (PSID-CDS-2007 and PSID-TAS-2017) to articulate a conceptual framework of life course influences on young adults' time spent using digital technologies. Inductive qualitative analyses built an initial framework, which was assessed with quantitative data, then further refined with qualitative analyses. Young adults drew on life course perspectives when discussing influences on their current digital technology use. As they suggested, in quantitative analyses more frequent adolescent technology use and greater device access weakly predicted increased technology frequency. Current school enrollment and several current peer factors predicted technology time. Interviewees emphasized the influence of parenting around technology use during adolescence, but parenting did not predict young adult screen time in quantitative analyses. Further qualitative analyses suggested that instead of influencing current technology time, earlier parenting shaped current emotional responses and imagined future technology use. We found young adults' technology use frequency to be informed by earlier experiences but highly malleable. Past technology use and current social contexts matter, but only up to a point. Moving beyond time use to incorporate emotional responses and future plans can better capture how the life course shapes technology use.

KW  - Extreme response style
KW  - Visual distance
AB  - In four survey experiments we show that people generally answer more extremely to survey items presented in vertical versus horizontal Likert formats. Our findings suggest that this effect may be at least partly driven by differences in the visual range spanned by the response scale (i.e. the visual distance between endpoint response categories is larger in horizontal than in a vertical format). In addition, compared to traditional horizontal Likert data, vertical Likert data contain more variance, which is mainly non-substantive. As a result, data obtained with scale formats that have different distances between response categories (as is typically the case for vertical vs. horizontal formats) may lead to differences in measurement model parameter estimates like residual terms, and in some cases factor loadings and construct correlations. Based on these results, we provide recommendations on the use of response scale formats in online surveys, bearing in mind that several online survey tool providers promote the use of vertical Likert formats and even automatically change traditional horizontal formats of Likert-type items to vertical Likert formats when viewed on small screens (e.g., on mobile phones).

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak forced most of the world's population to be confined at home to prevent contagion. Research reveals that one of the consequences of this confinement for children is an increased amount of time spent using screens (television, computers, and mobile devices, etc.) at home. This exploratory study aims to analyze the association between screen time exposure and emotional/behavioral problems of infants and children aged under 7 years, as manifested during the lockdown period in Portugal due to the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. The study was controlled for sociodemographic and confinement variables. A sample of 193 parents of children aged from 6 months to 6 years and 12 months, residing in Portugal, completed a survey about the time and manner of use of screen time exposure of their children. Data were derived on circumstances both before and after the confinement; the survey also explored the child's behavioral and emotional adjustment. The findings revealed a modest relationship between children's exposure time to screens and behavioral and emotional problems on children studied. It was also found that parents may play an important role in children's behavioral and emotional adjustment during the confinement period.

TI  - The transferability of handwriting skills: from the Cyrillic to the Latin alphabet

AB  - Do handwriting skills transfer when a child writes in two different scripts, such as the Latin and Cyrillic alphabets? Are our measures of handwriting skills intrinsically bound to one alphabet or will a child who faces handwriting difficulties in one script experience similar difficulties in the other script? To answer these questions, 190 children from grades 1-4 were asked to copy a short text using both the Cyrillic and Latin alphabets on a digital tablet. A recent change of policy in Kazakhstan gave us an opportunity to measure transfer, as the Latin-based Kazakh alphabet has not yet been introduced. Therefore, pupils in grade 1 had a 6-months experience in Cyrillic, and pupils in grades 2, 3, and 4 had 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5 years of experience in Cyrillic, respectively. This unique situation created a quasi-experimental situation that allowed us to measure the influence of the number of years spent practicing Cyrillic on the quality of handwriting in the Latin alphabet. The results showed that some of the differences between the two scripts were constant across all grades. These differences thus reflect the intrinsic differences in the handwriting dynamics between the two alphabets. For instance, several features related to the pen pressure on the tablet are quite different. Other features, however, revealed decreasing differences between the two scripts across grades. While we found that the quality of Cyrillic writing increased from grades 1-4, due to increased practice, we also found that the quality of the Latin writing increased as well, despite the fact that all of the pupils had the same absence of experience in writing in Latin. We can therefore interpret this improvement in Latin script as an indicator of the transfer of fine motor control skills from Cyrillic to Latin. This result is especially surprising given that one could instead hypothesize a negative transfer, i.e., that the finger controls automated for one alphabet would interfere with those required by the other alphabet. One interesting side-effect of these findings is that the algorithms that we developed for the diagnosis of handwriting difficulties among French-speaking children could be relevant for other alphabets, paving the way for the creation of a cross-lingual model for the detection of handwriting difficulties.

AB  - We introduce a design that is able to face some of the challenges that digital news consumption is posing to traditional media effects methods like linkage analysis. The challenges include (1) memory errors and biases when reporting everyday news media consumption leading to (2) errors when linking mass media outlets to survey data; (3) personalization of media content, as well as (4) short-term dynamic processes. Mobile Intensive Longitudinal Linkage Analysis (MILLA) uses an innovative combination of smartphone data donations to capture media exposure and relevant media content, a mobile experience sampling questionnaire to capture immediate reactions to news, and the content analysis of uploaded news media content to measure media effects. The design is explained by using an example of negativity in the news and its effects on emotional reactions of recipients.

AB  - As indoor wayfinding can be very challenging, adapted systems, which adapt the route instruction type, are being developed to facilitate more supportive indoor route guidance. In this study, such a system has been developed based on the results of an online survey. This adapted system was compared with a non-adapted system by use of eye tracking, position tracking, an orientation test and a questionnaire. The results revealed that using symbols instead of photos reduced the imposed cognitive load, while using 3D-simulations instead of photos improved the environmental awareness. This resulted in less wayfinding errors with the adapted system, compared to the non-adapted system. Therefore, the present study provides additional evidence on the benefits of adapted systems for indoor route guidance.

AB  - Objective: Examine the uncertainty management process of individuals with Lynch syndrome (LS).
   Methods: 19 phone interviews were conducted with individuals with LS. The interview guide included questions on family communication, risk perceptions, and uncertainty management. Data were analyzed using the constant comparison method to code for emergent themes.
   Results: Qualitative analysis found individuals with LS tried to manage their uncertainty through preventive care, but were often confounded by healthcare barriers. Healthcare barriers included cost and insurance issues, absence of coordinated care, insufficient provider knowledge, and lack of patient-centered communication. Participants reported increased uncertainty and anxiety due to these barriers and used alternative uncertainty management strategies such as advocating for themselves with providers, seeking information online, and communicating with family for emotional support.
   Conclusion: Healthcare barriers identified in this study exacerbated uncertainty and anxiety for individuals with LS and challenged their ability to engage in preventive care. In response, participants used alternative uncertainty management strategies to reduce their uncertainty, which may have unintended negative consequences.
   Practice implications: Findings support the need for providers to partner with specialists in genetics and/or LS to better care for individuals with LS. Findings highlight opportunities for interventions in healthcare to better support individuals with LS. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - As interfaces between human beings and the digital world, mobile phones have evolved from relatively simple devices (e.g., feature phones) to complex products (e.g., smartphones). Many firms in emerging countries such as China have successfully entered the mobile phone sector. A research question that emerges from the evidence on China is whether the entry strategies of these catching up firms have been affected by the introduction of smartphones. In order to investigate this question, the article follows the methodology of evolutionary theory and history-friendly models. It first examines historically the various strategies of the Chinese entrants in the mobile phone sector. On the basis of this empirical analysis, it then develops appreciative theorizing on the factors that have affected the catch-up entry strategies. Our results show that the successful catch-up entry strategies differ depending on the sectoral environment. A technology-driven strategy is more appropriate when there is a market sheltered from competition, so that technological capabilities can be accumulated; on the contrary a marketing-driven strategy is more appropriate when standardized technological solutions become widely available. The article contributes to the catch-up literature by identifying a new entry strategy and by pointing at the role of the sectoral environment, and to the sectoral innovation system literature by addressing the catch-up strategies of latecomer firms under different technological, industrial structure, and market conditions.

AB  - Mobile phone use while driving (MWD) is a threat to road safety, particularly for younger drivers. Research suggests impulsivity may be a psychological risk factor for MWD, however, the literature is limited. The current study examined the unique contributions of impulsivity facets on different social interactive MWD behaviours, and whether these relationships were influenced by mobile phone involvement. Eight hundred and fifty-three young drivers aged 17-25 years (M (age) = 19.89; 74 % female) completed an online questionnaire which included measures of the five-facet model of impulsivity, mobile phone involvement, and MWD (initiating, monitoring/reading, and responding to social communications). Of impulsivity facets, lower premeditation and higher positive urgency significantly predicted each MWD behaviour, while higher sensation seeking significantly predicted responding only, providing some support for differential relationships of impulsivity facets with MWD. Mobile phone involvement was a more robust predictor of MWD. Moreover, there were significant indirect effects of positive and negative urgency via mobile phone involvement for all three MWD behaviours. Findings highlight the importance of mobile phone involvement for explaining MWD which should be addressed in future studies.

AB  - Information and communication technology (ICT) is a key driver of urbanization but can also create the digital divide that hinders urbanization. The study aims to explore the dynamic relationship among ICT, the digital divide and urbanization in China. Employing data collected from prefecture-level cities in 2017, this study first constructs a composite urbanization index through principal component analysis (PCA), then applies geographically-weighted regression (GWR) model and partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLSSEM) to probe the effects of ICT on overall urbanization. The results suggest that ICT positively affects urbanization and directly improves urbanization levels and efficiency. The application of mobile phones is an indispensable tool for future urban development. However, there are digital divides among areas. Less-developed cities lag behind well-developed ones due to their poor basic conditions and low-levels of ICT perception among residents. Therefore, knowing how to boost ICT development, narrow the digital divide and promote urbanization is of great importance. The essential role of the government in urbanization and technological progress emphasized, and it is believed that government-led ICT-based urbanization can alleviate the digital divide and achieve balanced regional development.

AB  - Web survey respondents are frequently distracted during survey completion, which potentially affects the quality of data they provide. This article reports on results from a laboratory experiment examining how distractions during web survey completion influence data quality. Participants were randomly assigned to experimental groups using a 2 (device type) x 3 (form of distraction) between-subject factorial design. They were asked to complete a web questionnaire on either a PC or a tablet and were allocated to one of the three distraction conditions: (1) the presence of other people in the room who have a loud conversation, (2) the presence of music, or (3) no distraction. The study examines the effect of distraction on various measures of data quality and attentiveness. While participants felt significantly more distracted in the presence of other people or music, the study found no significant effect of distraction for any of the data quality and attentiveness measures. The findings are encouraging for survey practitioners: Even if web respondents listen to music or are in noisy environments, these forms of distraction generally do not seem to affect the quality of responses they provide.

AB  - Background The digitalisation of literature is proliferating, and the increasing spread of digital reading devices and the availability of digital texts is likely to make books on screen a lasting phenomenon, but little attention has been paid to the consequences of digitalisation for the experience of narrative fiction. While on the one hand, reading literature on a digital reading device might trigger a superficial processing of the text, and problems regarding orientation within the narrative, the awareness of reading a literary text might, on the other hand, lead to more in-depth and complex processing, independent of reading medium. This study examines whether the reading performance and the emotional and cognitive experiences of the reception of a literary text vary between reading a printed book or an e-reader.
   Methods Using a between-subjects experimental design, 207 participants read the beginning of a novel either in a printed book or on an e-reader. They then completed a reading comprehension test and questionnaires about their cognitive and emotional experiences.
   Results Overall, the results do not suggest the clear superiority of either of the two reading media. Neither reading speed nor reading comprehension differed significantly between the two groups. Even though a broad range of reading experiences was measured, neither cognitive nor emotional reading experiences differed significantly between the groups.
   Conclusion An e-reader does not affect either reading performance or cognitive and emotional experience of reading a narrative text, compared with a printed book.

AB  - Combining mobile tracking data and a survey experiment, Munzert et al. show that Germany's contact tracing app is underused by those who socially distance less; however, even small cash incentives increased app uptake in the cohort.
   Digital contact tracing apps have been introduced globally as an instrument to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, privacy by design impedes both the evaluation of these tools and the deployment of evidence-based interventions to stimulate uptake. We combine an online panel survey with mobile tracking data to measure the actual usage of Germany's official contact tracing app and reveal higher uptake rates among respondents with an increased risk of severe illness, but lower rates among those with a heightened risk of exposure to COVID-19. Using a randomized intervention, we show that informative and motivational video messages have very limited effect on uptake. However, findings from a second intervention suggest that even small monetary incentives can strongly increase uptake and help make digital contact tracing a more effective tool.

AB  - This study examined the effect of mobile operator promotions (MOP) on customer purchase intentions using longitudinal survey data (over two phases in a two-year period) from mobile phone consumers in South Korea. Results indicated that MOP led indirectly to repurchase intentions, but moderated mediation effects varied across time points. MOP appears primarily to moderate brand attitudes, which strongly influence repurchase intentions. Specifically, the direct effect appears between purchase intentions at time T and repurchase intentions at T + 1; however, the moderating influence of MOP is limited in these timeframes.

AB  - Purpose The aim of this exploratory study is to analyze if the most used factors related to the engaging interaction and long-term engagement with online applications can be applied to WhatsApp in a context of everyday life in Madrid and to investigate what parameters would best describe the engagement with WhatsApp in this context. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative method was employed to explore the cognitive, emotional and behavioral factors that mainly comprise the experience of a user with an online application, both at a point in time and over time. Data from 30 semi-structured interviews and questionnaires from six group chats were collected and analyzed. The sample was made up of people aged from 13 to 58 years old. Findings Findings suggest that the factors used in this study to evaluate long-term engagement and engaging interactions with WhatsApp are relevant, except for cognitive factors related to engaging interactions, indicating that the cognitive point of view is more difficult to apply in the engaging interaction analysis. Other attributes related to information retrieval are suggested, best suited to the informative use of this tool. Originality/value Long-term engagement studies are scarcer concerning Mobile Instant Messaging applications. Regarding engagement interaction, its analysis focusing on WhatsApp has not been approached. This study suggests the convenience of using parameters related to information to evaluate the engaging interaction, according to the informative use of the application.

AB  - Against the backdrop of an aging world population increasingly affected by a diverse range of abilities and disabilities as well as the rise of ubiquitous computing and digital app cultures, this paper questions how mobile technologies mediate between heterogeneous environments and sensing beings. To approach the current technological manufacturing of the senses, two lines of thought are of importance: First, there is a need to critically reflect upon the concept of assistive technologies (AT) as artifacts providing tangible solutions for a specific disability. Second, the conventional distinction between user and environment requires a differentiated consideration. This contribution will first review James Gibson's concept of "affordances" and modify this approach by introducing theories and methods of Science and Technology Studies (STS) and Actor-Network Theory (ANT). Then, we present two case studies where we explore the relations between recent "assistive" app technologies and human sensory perception. As hearing and seeing are key in this regard, we concentrate on two specific media technologies: ReSound LINX2, a hearing aid which allows for direct connect (via Bluetooth) with iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch, and Camassia, an IOS app for sonic wayfinding for blind people. We emphasize the significance of dis-/abling practices for manufacturing novel forms of hearing and seeing and drawing on sources like promotional materials by manufacturers, ads, or user testimonials and reviews. Our analysis is interested in the reciprocal relationships between users and their socio-technical and media environments. By and large, this contribution will provide crucial insights into the contemporary entanglement of algorithm-driven technologies, daily practices, and sensing subjects: the production of techno-sensory arrangements.

AB  - The identification of factors that affect people's continuous use of e-books on their mobile devices is critical for e-book publishers, e-reader manufacturers and academic researchers. This study proposes a research model that extends the expectation-confirmation model by incorporating perceived enjoyment and facilitating conditions to get a deeper understanding of continuance intention to use e-books in the mobile environment. The structural equation model (SEM) was used to analyse data which were collected from 1,663 e-book readers by an online survey. The results indicate that satisfaction, perceived enjoyment, perceived usefulness and facilitating conditions influence continuance intention significantly. Furthermore, users' confirmation of expectations has a positive effect on perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment and satisfaction. Surprisingly, perceived usefulness does not have a significant effect on satisfaction. Based on these findings, the theoretical and practical implications, limitations, and recommendations for future research are also discussed.

AB  - Globalization, technological development and a dynamic business environment influence the change of customer information demands. It becomes vital for organizations to find out the customer demand change and discover technological solutions to satisfy these demands. One of these technologies is augmented reality, which connects real and digital environments by expanding it with digitally coded information which is decoded by using a specific device. As this type of technology enables the changing information needs of customers to be met faster, organizations are increasingly using these technological solutions to achieve a variety of purposes: to position products innovatively, increase product awareness, create added value for the customer, increase sales. However, organizations often face the challenge of evaluating commercial augmented reality mobile applications in user experience. A two-case study has been selected to evaluate the user experience of augmented reality commercial mobile applications and provide recommendations for their development to address this issue. In this research, such methods as scoping scientific literature review, expert evaluation, and user experience questionnaire method were used. The study has identified the main factors influencing the positive user experience: the explicit purpose of the application, easy to use and learn, smooth operation, imaginative information presentation, and interactivity.

AB  - The proliferation of smartphones and mobile communication has enabled users to capture images or videos and share them immediately on social networking and messaging platforms. Unfortunately, these platforms are also used to manipulate the masses by performing social engineering attacks by sharing fabricated images (or videos). These attacks cause public shame, ethnic violence and claim lives. With the rise of advanced image processing tools, the deep fakes are automated, and their implications are boundless. In this article, we discuss different types of modification of images/videos and survey the corresponding methods and tools. We also highlight the ongoing efforts to detect fake images and videos using advanced machine learning tools and fact-checking. Along with these tools, we also need different complementary approaches discouraging the production and propagation of manipulative forged images and videos on the Internet. This paper further emphasizes that we desperately need socio-technological solutions that empower end-users with the right tools to make an informed moral decision while producing, uploading, and sharing media. Finally, supporting this, we discuss a holistic blockchain-based solution.

AB  - The quality of a group decision depends on its members sharing and adopting their various perspectives. Multi-criteria models provide an appropriate vehicle for managing this information sharing because they break down the decision into small, single-issue questions that can be treated independently. We present a new lexicographic decision method with three equivalence classes for use by a group. Our algorithm is the first to combine the hidden profile and multi-criteria paradigms and thereby improving the consensus by identifying critical disagreements and inviting the decision makers to share their mental models of them. A computer simulation demonstrates the algorithm's effectiveness and efficiency. Unless the problem parameters are very unfavorable, the method achieves the desired choice set or a close approximation to it significantly faster than the commonly used compensatory methods. Our algorithm can either provide step-by-step instructions to a human facilitator, or it can be implemented as a software agent acting as a fully automated digital facilitator, allowing decision makers to participate "on the go" using their internet-connected mobile devices.

AB  - This study highlights differences in how mobile, portable, and fixed forms of information and communication technology (ICT) use support bonding and bridging forms of social capital. Results from a two-wave longitudinal panel survey revealed that dominant patterns of use were: 1) personal for mobile phones; 2) political for desktop PC; 3) personal as well as political uses for laptop, while tablet did not show any manifest usage patterns. Follow-up analysis linked specific uses of each medium to the distinct forms of social capital. We found that mobile phone use for personal relationships and coordinating activities contributed to bonding capital, while desktop PC use for political communication and information exchange supported bridging capital. Uses of laptop computers and tablets had no effect on any of social capital in this study.

AB  - With the increase in video consumption on mobile devices, Korean broadcasters have begun to provide short video clips of re-edited existing broadcast content. This study aims to investigate the motivations that drive Korean consumers to watch short clips online and understand the behaviour of consumers to analyse video clips' additional promotional effects. Exploratory factor analysis and hierarchical regression were performed with online survey data. Findings suggest that selective entertainment is the most important factor affecting video clip consumption, intent to watch live programming on TV, and intent to purchase VOD. Additionally, video clip use motives have a strong influence on the intent to watch live programming on TV and purchase VOD. Therefore, broadcasters may consider consumers' psychological needs when providing video clip content. Because no academic study has attempted to investigate the relation between video clips usage and use patterns, this findings will be helpful for future research.

KW  - PERSONAL DATA
AB  - With the implementation of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on 25 May 2018, a new regulatory regime for business in Europe and beyond has begun. Many companies had to adjust their data processing processes to meet GDPR compliance requirements. GDPR stipulates that data controllers must have a legal basis for the collection and processing of personal data. One of the most common ways for personal data to be collected and shared online is through website cookies. A cookie is a small text file that is downloaded onto 'terminal equipment' when the user accesses a website. It allows the website to recognise that user's device and store some information about the user's preferences or past actions. Cookies, insofar as they are used to identify users, qualify as personal data and are therefore subject to the GDPR. The investigative problem of this study is expressed through the following question: Which requirements are applied to cookie usage now that the GDPR has come into effect, and what impact has this had on Lithuania's top popular websites? The main purpose of this article is to assess the tendencies as regards the usage of the cookies in accordance with GDPR requirements on the most popular Lithuanian websites. The methodological framework used in the investigation is based on scientific literature analysis and the qualitative research method. The work carried out theoretical narrative, systematic, comparative analysis, and generalisation. A qualitative case study was carried out examining the 100 most popular Lithuanian websites. The obtained empirical findings demonstrate that Lithuanian websites use cookies in breach of GDPR requirements and that complex violations occur. In Lithuania, unlike the other EU Member States, violations pertaining to cookie management continue to remain unnoticed, organisations do not abide by GDPR requirements en masse, whereas individual users and the State Data Protection Inspection are merely passive observers. The conclusions and recommendations of the research have practical value, which will help organisations, users and supervisory authorities to identify the violations connected to cookie usage and to take the relevant measures in order to ensure that data are being processed lawfully and in keeping with GDPR requirements.

AB  - With vast information that has been digitized and made available online, manually finding the answer to a question can be tedious. While search engines have emerged to facilitate information needs, users would have to manually read through the retrieved articles to locate the answer to a specific question. Therefore, the ability to automatically understand users' natural language questions and find the correct answers could prove crucial in information retrieval. Indeed, such automatic question-answering solutions have been extensively studied by the natural language processing (NLP) research communities. However, most of the development targets questions and information sources composed in high-resource languages such as English and Chinese. In this paper, we propose WabiQA, a novel system for automatically answering questions in the Thai language using the Thai Wikipedia articles as the knowledge source. Specifically, the proposed method first retrieves the Wikipedia article that is most likely to contain the answer. Then, a bidirectional LSTM model is used to read the article and locate candidate answers, which are ranked by confidence levels and returned to the user. WabiQA won the first prize award from Thailand's National Software Contest 2019 under category "Question-Answering Program from Thai Wikipedia," with 83.5%, 34.80%, and 45.96%, and outperforming the next best competitors' systems by 19.99, 24.26, and 33.10 percentage points in terms of Accuracy@1, EM, and F1 respectively. Furthermore, we also develop a prototype mobile application that aims to facilitate Thai users with visual impairment using voice-to-speech technology and an intelligent question-answer categorization. The findings of this research not only expand the horizon of the possibility to develop intelligent NLP applications for the Thai language using only available existing Thai NLP tools, resources, and deep learning technologies, but also shed light on the possibility to apply such techniques to develop many intelligent NLP tasks for the Thai and other low-resource languages such as reading assessment, writing assistance, and entity linking.

AB  - In this article, the author explores the use of electronic devices when they enter the treatment room in child and adolescent psychoanalytic therapies. Smolen demonstrates through the clinical material of two adolescent patients, how electronic devices enter the treatments in a pathological and malignant way. She continues to demonstrate through the treatments of another adolescent and a latency child how the use of devices acted as transitional objects and allowed both children to progress in their treatments, however she continues to question the optimal use of such devices in these treatments. Smolen finishes by demonstrating how a young child used the electronic device to communicate difficulties with separation and how she was able to work through these conflicts and move on to more age appropriate play. Finally, Smolen demonstrated how by prohibiting such devices and working with parents her patient was able to access his creativity and ability to play.

AB  - Data sharing has become prevalent with the rapid growth of mobile technologies. A lack of awareness and understanding of privacy practices often results in the installation of privacy-invasive applications (apps) which could potentially put users' personal data at risk. This study aimed to explore how users' risk perception could be shifted towards more privacy-aware decisions through generation fluency and framing manipulations. It is an online study composed of three components, an experiment and two questionnaires. We manipulated the availability of privacy worries, by asking participants to generate either 2 or 10 privacy worries. Generating 10 worries was experienced as difficult, whereas generating 2 was easy. The difficult experience led to downgraded perception of risk, and consequently increased likelihood of installing a low privacy rated fictional app. Therefore, we suggest that improving generation fluency of privacy concerns could encourage users' adoption of a more conservative judgment strategy when installing an app, safeguarding them against privacy-invasive apps.

AB  - This study proposes an integrated technology acceptance model to investigate the factors that affect drivers' usage intention of mobile navigation applications. The proposed model adds three new constructs (drivers' sense of direction, navigation application affinity and distraction perception) to the original technology acceptance model based on the features of mobile navigation applications. First, a questionnaire was developed and ad-ministered, and data from 384 drivers were collected via an online survey. Second, confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to examine the reliability and validity of the developed scale based on the collected data. Third, a structural equation model was constructed to investigate the interrelationships among these constructs in the conceptual research model and to identify the key factors that affect drivers' acceptance of mobile navigation applications. The proposed model explained 60.50% of the variance in the intention to use mobile navigation applications. In addition to attitude and perceived usefulness, navigation application affinity and distraction perception also significantly affected drivers' intention to use mobile navigation applications. Navigation application affinity and distraction perception affected not only drivers' intention to use but also their perceptions. Sense of direction was a significant individual trait that affected drivers' navigation application affinity, distraction perception, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. These findings imply that relevant developers should continually optimize the incorrect and inappropriate use of navigation information and that they should attach importance to the amount and intelligibility of navigation information. Furthermore, the prompt form of navigation information should satisfy the demands and expectations of drivers with different senses of direction. Overall, this study improves our understanding of drivers' acceptance of mobile navigation applications and provides some important practical implications to improve mobile navigation services.

AB  - Purpose: Recent research has identified a relationship between perceived stress and problematic smartphone usage. However, little is known about the underlying mediating and moderating mechanisms. The present study aimed to test the relationship between perceived stress and problematic smartphone usage as well as the mediating role of online social support and the moderating role of perceived social support among Chinese undergraduates.
   Patients and Methods: A sample of 1123 college students participated in the study. The Perceived Stress Scale, Mobile Phone Addiction Index Scale, Online Social Support Questionnaire, and Perceived Social Support Scale were used.
   Results: Perceived stress was significantly and positively associated with problematic smartphone usage, and online social support partially mediated the relationship between perceived stress and problematic smartphone usage. Moderated mediation analysis suggested that perceived social support moderated the association between perceived stress and online social support. This relationship became stronger for college students with lower levels of perceived social support.
   Conclusion: The results of this study can contribute to a better understanding of how perceived stress increases the risk of problematic smartphone usage. The importance of reducing online social support and enhancing perceived social support in preventing undergraduates' problematic smartphone usage is highlighted. The findings should be taken with caution given the convenience sampling and cross-sectional study design.

AB  - In contemporary life, the mobile phone is integral to digital and material placemaking practices. In this article, drawing on ethnographic analysis conducted in Perth and Melbourne (Australia) in the first months of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, we explore how this relation has been recalibrated as an effect of 'stay-at-home' restrictions. We first provide a brief overview of our methodological and interpretative approach - drawing from postphenomenology as a useful framework for understanding the mobile-body-place relation and digital placemaking at home. Second, we consider how mobile media are 'situated' in the domestic environment. Third, through an analysis of participant narratives, we explore the concept of net locality (Gordon and de Souza e Silva (2011) through the lens of embodiment theory and suggest that the Covid-19 context has altered our experience of 'networked corporeality'. Finally, we discuss the ambiguity of digital intimacy in the decoupling of mobile media and the body as a result of a rapid increase in both screen time and time spent at home. Throughout the article, we argue that mobile media use in the home is thoroughly enmeshed in the shifting boundaries of privacy, placemaking and domestic space. We question how the placemaking functionality of mobile media, the intimate body-technology relation specific to mobile media practices and 'being-at-home' were subsequently modified by physical distancing and isolation.

AB  - Surveys continue to be a popular way of collecting data in the social sciences. But, despite their popularity they have a number of limitations including the possibility of changing the behaviour of respondents. Such mere-measure or question-behaviour effects can compromise the external validity of social data. In this article, we use digital trace data collected from PCs and mobile devices to investigate the effects of surveys on news and politics consumption. Using a non-probability panel of respondents in Germany we combine the digital trace data with that from three online surveys regarding the federal election. In contrast to our expectation, the participation in the survey does not influence online news and politics media consumption. Furthermore, we find weak evidence that respondents with previous high media consumption are less likely to be influenced by doing the survey compared to those with low media consumption.

AB  - When using digital goods that extensively collect user information, privacy uncertainty, which is consumers' difficulty in assessing the privacy of the data they entrust to others, is a major concern. We extend the existing literature on uncertainty in online marketplaces by incorporating privacy uncertainty, and we distinguish among three subdimensions of privacy uncertainty-namely collection, use, and protection. We subsequently theorize and empirically test the antecedents and consequences of this new construct in the context of mobile apps. Consistent with economic theory, we argue that because consumers possess less information than the app seller as a result of the presence of hidden characteristics and hidden action, privacy uncertainty is evoked. Using the factorial survey method, we test our theoretical model in the context of buying a mobile app. The results show that privacy uncertainty significantly influences potential users' intention to use an app above and beyond their uncertainty about the seller and the product. Privacy uncertainty also affects the perceived risk associated with using an app and the price consumers are willing to pay for it. In addition, we find that privacy uncertainty is driven by the uncertainty about privacy practices in regard to the collection, use, and protection of data collected at the time of downloading the app-and more important, the data collected while the app is being used. The results of another factorial survey study suggest that privacy uncertainty is distinct from seller and product uncertainties and has unique drivers. The results of a survey of current users of existing mobile apps indicate that the effects of privacy uncertainty extend to the postadoption stage, where it remains a strong influencer of continued use intentions and perceived risk.

AB  - While the effectiveness of airbags for reducing mortality in avalanche involvements has been examined in various studies, the question of whether the added safety benefit might lead to increased risk-taking - a phenomenon referred to as risk compensation or risk homeostasis - has only been tackled by a few researchers. Building on the existing research on airbags, risk compensation, and stated terrain preferences in winter backcountry recreation, we conducted an extensive online survey including a discrete choice experiment to approach the topic of avalanche airbags and risk compensation from multiple perspectives. Our study sample consists of 163 airbag owners and 243 non-owners mainly from Switzerland, Germany, and Austria. The analyses of the survey responses provide both indirect and direct evidence that risk compensation in response to avalanche airbags is likely within at least certain segments of the recreational backcountry and out-of-bounds skiing population. Initial indirect evidence on risk compensation is provided by examining participants' responses to airbag attitude and use questions using the framework of Hedlund (2000). The stated terrain preferences in our discrete choice experiment with and without airbags indicate that non-owners of airbags might make more aggressive terrain choices when they are given an airbag, whereas the preference patterns of owners did not change when the airbag was taken away from them. Finally, our analysis of avalanche involvement rates with and without airbags offers the most direct evidence that more thrill-seeking backcountry users are taking higher risks when equipped with airbags. The paper concludes with a discussion that highlights that the potential for risk compensation is not a strong argument against the use of avalanche airbags.
   Management implications:
   If properly used, avalanche airbags are an effective avalanche safety device for reducing the risk of critical burials and death.
   Considerable indirect and direct evidence exists that highlights that avalanche airbags likely lead to risk compensation within at least some segments of the recreational backcountry and out-ofbounds skiing population.
   Risk-taking in the backcountry is a personal choice, but recreationalists should have the necessary information about the direct and potential indirect effects of safety devices to make informed decisions.
   The topic of risk compensation should be included in avalanche awareness courses and discussed in avalanche airbag support documentation and user manuals to increase the awareness of the potential among users.
   Additional avalanche accident research should be conducted to better understand the circumstances when the effectiveness of airbags is limited.

AB  - There is a limited body of experimental research examining the comparability of completing self-report surveys using different computerized devices. Additionally, available literature has not used complete or optimal procedures for determining device equivalence. The current study examined the comparability of surveys completed using paper-and-pencil and three popular devices: smartphone, tablet, and desktop computer. Participants consisted of 211 college students randomly assigned to conditions who completed measures of personality, social desirability, and computer self-efficacy. Results showed evidence of qualitative equivalence (internal consistency and subscale intercorrelations) across conditions. For quantitative and auxiliary equivalence, both equivalence testing and Bayesian analyses were conducted. Equivalence testing indicated quantitative (mean score) equivalence, as well as comparability for one aspect of auxiliary equivalence (missing data). Other aspects of auxiliary equivalence (completion time and comfort completing questionnaires) suggested potentially meaningful differences. Bayesian analyses typically replicated these results, with some notable exceptions regarding auxiliary equivalence.

AB  - This article explores the integration of the mobile phone into the religious experience of Christians in Nigeria. Based on the results of an online survey and the author's observation, it argues that the mobile phone has become an actant in the mediatization of religion, creating dependency among some users and transforming religious praxis in palpable ways. Unsurprisingly, perspectives vary on whether and how the phone should be used during worship. Attitudes coalesce around three viewpoints, leading to the emergence of user groups labelled critics, advocates, and dualists. The accounts of study participants give access into the ways some people seek to (re)configure their engagement with religion by inserting the mobile phone as a multifunctional techno-spiritual gadget.

AB  - In this study, the development of an e-learning portal for university students is presented. The portal is based on responsive web design which is accessible from anywhere, at any time and on any device. A complementary user experience evaluation methodology consisting of heuristic evaluation, usability testing, user experience questionnaire and eye tracking has been applied to get a holistic understanding and identification of the potential usability problems in the portal. The methodology highlights the relative efficacy of each method. The results suggest that the heuristic evaluation identified more usability problems than the usability testing. However, few severe usability problems were identified in the usability testing and most of them were not spotted in the heuristic evaluation. For additional insights, the participants' objective visual responses were tracked using an eye tracker (Tobii X-30 Hz); the eye tracking data were also helpful in revealing the usability issues within the portal. The aggregated heat maps were helpful in identifying the complexity of the interface elements of the portal. The identified problems were fixed in the final version of the portal. Afterward, another usability test was carried out to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of the portal. The students' perceptions regarding both versions were also analyzed through the questionnaire. According to the results, the e-learning portal seems to be efficient and effective and the students were satisfied. The proposed methodology resulted in increasing the satisfaction of the students which can lead to the maximum utilization of the e-learning portal. It is recommended that by integrating these evaluation methods, many usability problems can be identified which can then be fixed for achieving maximum user acceptance of the e-learning portals and the similar web portals.

AB  - Nomophobia is considered as the "disorder of modern world" and defined as "fear of being without access to a mobile phone." This study investigated gender differences in the relationship between problematic Internet use and nomophobia. Structural equation modeling (SEM) approach was employed to assess the relationship between nomophobia and four dimensions of the problematic Internet use, including diminished impulse control, loneliness/depression, social comfort, and distraction. The study used the Online Cognition Scale (OCS) and Nomophobia Questionnaire (NMP-Q) to collect data from 490 undergraduate students. Results indicated that loneliness/depression, distraction, and diminished impulse control were significantly related to nomophobia. However, there was not a significant relationship between social comfort and nomophobia. Further, multi group analysis results suggested notable gender differences in the relationship between problematic Internet use and nomophobia. The results for women indicated that loneliness/depression, diminished-impulse control, and distraction have a positive and significant relationship with nomophobia. Whereas only loneliness/depression and distraction were found to be significantly related to nomophobia among men. The results indicated a statistically significant difference in nomophobia and problematic Internet use between women and men subjects, where women subjects scored higher than the men.

AB  - Blockchain technology has been gaining great interest from a variety of industry sectors, including financial, food processing, and power and energy markets. Realizing the strength of blockchain technology beyond the successful application in the cryptocurrency arena, researchers have been evaluating and using blockchain for applications such as supply chain management, transactive industry (both financial and energy), system integrity, device cybersecurity, identity management, and much more. One of the unique elements of the blockchain technology that made it such a captivating technology to researchers is its plethora of features. Some of the features include smart contracts, cryptocurrency and tokenizing, immutable distributed ledger, cryptographic hashing, and digital signature. In addition, there are multiple types of blockchains, such as permissioned/private and permissionless/public, and various consensus models, such as proof-of-work, proof-of-authority, proof-of-burn, and proof-of-stake. Therefore, it is often nontrivial to determine if an application requires a blockchain. If so, what kind of blockchain and consensus is most appropriate? This article discusses the blockchain applicability framework (BAF), which was specifically designed with the purpose to answer those questions. The BAF is divided into five domains, 18 subdomains, and about 100 controls. It is designed to ingest detailed user requirements to perform a weighted evaluation that is built on mathematical constructs to determine the ideal combination of blockchain that is appropriate for an application. Along with the core logical formulation of the BAF, this article depicts the efficacy of the BAF through two use cases.

AB  - This cross-country survey research investigated the relationship between screen addiction and media multitasking and examined factors that mediate and moderate this relationship. The web survey recruited Internet users owning multiple devices in the United States (N = 798) and Taiwan (N = 834). Although American users spent longer time on screen devices and engaged more in media multitasking more, Taiwanese respondents had higher screen addiction. Results showed that media multitasking and screen device use were positively related to screen addiction. Country of respondents' residence moderated the relationship between media multitasking and screen addiction. Additionally, screen device usage mediated the positive effects of media multitasking on screen addiction. Finally, leisure boredom moderated screen device usage's mediating effects on the relationship between media multitasking and screen addiction, which differed in two countries. Young people and females tended to have high levels of screen addiction. Implications of screen addiction and media multitasking were discussed.

AB  - Digital provide consists of electronic media, telecommunications, and computer technologies information and communication technologies (ICTs) availability, accessibility, and utilisation, which simplifies process. The convergence of ICTs ensures efficiency in resources allocation and promotes system growth. This study examines the convergence in global information and communication technologies (ICT) development for 205 countries spanning 2000-2018. We employ the Phillips and Sul econometric methodology, which tests for the existence of convergence clubs and the modelling of different transition paths to convergence. We further disaggregated our panel data into nine regions. We constructed an ICT development index (comprising of mobile line, fixed line, and internet access penetration) via principal component analysis. Our findings suggest the presence of panel convergence at the global and regional levels (except for Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, which exhibited divergence). However, we identified convergence clubs using an iterative testing procedure. The key findings from the club convergence algorithm results suggest that: (i) at the global level, club 1 converges; (ii) at regional levels, Sub-Saharan Africa forms 7 clubs; (iii) clubs 1 in the remaining 8 regions converged. Contrary to previous findings, this study finds that the process of convergence in ICT development reflects the desirable emanations of telecommunication policies sharing similar characteristics, at least to some extent, in terms of the ICT sharing across the globe.

AB  - The significance of mobile devices in digital learning is growing fast as they allow users to have easier access to content materials and build engaging interactions with others. On the other hand, there exist concerns without enough systematic investigations that users may be distracted when using mobile devices for learning. Drawing upon the value-based adoption perspective in combination with habit, this study investigates m-learning dynamics using a survey method with 257 participants. The results showed that habit has a direct impact on utilitarian/hedonic values and m-learning continuance intention, but a distal influence on learning outcomes. The analysis of results by the mobile device types indicates differences in m-learning dynamics between users with handheld mobile devices and those with laptops. For handheld mobile device users, hedonic value has a greater impact on learning outcomes than utilitarian value does, while utilitarian value has more influence on learning outcomes for laptop users.

AB  - We investigated the impact of color salience and location of a website link on users' performance, affective experiences and approach-avoidance tendencies with 10 mock mobile Web directories. Task completion times were recorded by a computer program, and users' affective experiences and approach-avoidance responses were reported in questionnaires. Results implied that visual attention in the display area on a mobile Web directory is directed by a combination of bottom-up and top-down processes, which is different from the primarily top-down process implicated in a similar study of PC Web directories. A salient color of the website link helped attract users' attention and increase users' sense of control over the process. Also, users are likely to search webpages from top left to bottom right. Our findings suggest that a target website link placed in the top left corner or displayed in a distinct color in the center area not only attracts users' attention but also results in a more highly rated affective experience. Color of the target website link can be changed to increase users' sense of control of a Web directory and approach behaviors.

AB  - Through a large-scale national survey, this study provided the first comprehensive examination of podcast users in the United States from the perspectives of motivation and usage. It deepened our understanding of this new on-demand audio platform in the context of consumption drivers, behaviors, and competing media options. The results showed that entertainment, information, and audio platform superiority were the most important motivators for podcast consumption. In addition, motives were found to affect listening behaviors, including listening settings, width, depth, and routine of listening, and usage of competing audio media, such as regular radio, online radio, and streaming music. The findings revealed that podcasting is a distinct medium with unique characteristics rather than a mobile, on-demand extension of existing audio platforms like radio. Podcast consumption, especially on today's complex media platforms, is multidimensional and should be measured from multiple aspects and examined in various settings.

AB  - It is very challenging for children with autism to express their emotions to others as well as to recognise others' feelings accurately. As social difficulties of autistic people might aggravate their loneliness and social isolation, a holistic development is required from an early age. This study aimed to suggest a digital intervention for supporting autistic children's empathy development by using design thinking. This study developed a mobile-interface design on the basis of the human-centred design approach, and a prototype was evaluated by stakeholders with respect to acceptability and usability. Usability was measured by twelve statements of a combination of design guidelines and the system usability scale, and subsequently, open-end interview questions were offered to collect data regarding acceptability. The separate interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim, and thus, meaningful data were selected and clustered by themes. The result of the qualitative data analysis is represented by eighteen themes in five categories. Altogether, this research suggests a phased (bit-by-bit) strategy for teaching empathy of children with ASD through a digital intervention.

AB  - The market for food delivery mobile applications (FDMAs) in South Korea has massively expanded due to the increase in both smartphone penetration rate and single-person households, thus marking a phase of severe competition. A deeper understanding among FDMA practitioners of users' acceptance of FDMAs is required to become more competitive. The technology acceptance model (TAM) is a dominant theory to help illuminate users' acceptance of new technology. However, users' familiarity (FAM) and satisfaction (SAT) with new technology has been less studied in the context of FDMA. Based on this background, this study aims to examine the relationships between users' FAM, perceived ease of use (PEU), perceived usefulness (PU), SAT, and intention to reuse (IR) in the context of FDMAs. With the use of an online-based questionnaire, data were obtained from consumers who have experienced with one of the top-three mobile apps for food delivery in South Korea. Partial least squares structural equation modeling is employed to examine the extended TAM in the Korean FDMA setting. The findings demonstrate that (a) FAM has a positive influence on both PEU and PU; (b) PEU is positively associated with PU; (c) both FAM and PU positively affect SAT, but PEU does not; and (d) FAM, PU, and SAT are the significant antecedents of IR. This study then discusses the findings in terms of academic contributions and suggests practical implications, focusing on marketing strategies that can be usefully adopted by FDMA developers.

AB  - To explore socially desirable responding in telephone surveys, this study examines response latencies in answers to 27 questions in a corpus of 319 audio-recorded voice interviews on iPhones. Response latencies were compared when respondents (a) answered questions on sensitive vs. nonsensitive topics (as classified by online raters); (b) produced more vs. less socially desirable answers; and (c) were interviewed by a professional interviewer or an automated system. Respondents answered questions on sensitive topics more quickly than on nonsensitive topics, though patterns varied by question format (categorical, numerical, ordinal). Independent of question sensitivity, respondents gave less socially desirable answers more quickly when answering categorical and ordinal questions but more slowly when answering numeric questions. Respondents were particularly quicker to answer sensitive questions when asked by interviewers than by the automated system. Findings demonstrate that response times can be (differently) revealing about question and response sensitivity in a telephone survey.

AB  - The pervasive use of mobile information technologies brings new patterns of media usage, but also challenges to the measurement of media exposure. Researchers wishing to, for example, understand the nature of selective exposure on algorithmically driven platforms need to precisely attribute individuals' exposure to specific content. Prior research has used tracking data to show that survey-based self-reports of media exposure are critically unreliable. So far, however, little effort has been invested into assessing the specific biases of tracking methods themselves. Using data from a multimethod study, we show that tracking data from mobile devices is linked to systematic distortions in self-report biases. Further inherent but unobservable sources of bias, along with potential solutions, are discussed.

AB  - Despite the significance of studies related to mobile applications, little empirical research has been conducted into the factors that may affect visually impaired people's acceptance and usage of mobile applications. This study investigated how individuals with visual impairment (VI) adopt and use mobile applications (apps) in their daily lives based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology and explored what needs to be considered when developing a mobile app for people with VI. An online survey consisting of close-ended and open-ended questions was administered to a total of 259 participants with VI. Structural equation modeling was used to examine direct and moderated relationships among study variables. Thematic analysis was also conducted to analyze participants' responses to the open-ended questions. The results of the quantitative analysis revealed that the performance expectancy significantly predicted the behavioral intention to use mobile apps, and this relationship was significantly moderated by the attitude toward mobile apps. The qualitative analysis showed that the functionality and accessibility of mobile apps were essential for improving the acceptance and usage of mobile apps for persons with visual impairment. Moreover, future mobile apps need to focus on enhancing specific features in navigation, communication, visual identification, and screen reading. The theoretical and practical implications are further discussed.

AB  - This study examined which accompanying information elements were noticed by visitors while they were looking at artworks, using eye-tracking experiments. First, we conducted an online survey to grasp the types of information that visitors wanted to know, and five elements were obtained. Second, we collected information on these five elements through interviews with one artist. Third, eye-tracking experiments were performed with semi-structured interviews. We set the information delivery media as follows: wall and mobile texts as commonly used in art museums. The results showed that patterns of eye movement of visitors were different according to the information delivery media. Also, we found that there was a correlation between the results of the eye-tracking experiment and visitor interest. This study has limitations in that it is an experiment limited to small sample size and artwork genre; however, it is meaningful in that it was able to grasp the information needs of visitors through eye-tracking.

AB  - Commonly used screening tools for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) generally rely on subjective caregiver questionnaires. While behavioral observation is more objective, it is also expensive, time-consuming, and requires significant expertise to perform. As such, there remains a critical need to develop feasible, scalable, and reliable tools that can characterize ASD risk behaviors. This study assessed the utility of a tablet-based behavioral assessment for eliciting and detecting one type of risk behavior, namely, patterns of facial expression, in 104 toddlers (ASDN= 22) and evaluated whether such patterns differentiated toddlers with and without ASD. The assessment consisted of the child sitting on his/her caregiver's lap and watching brief movies shown on a smart tablet while the embedded camera recorded the child's facial expressions. Computer vision analysis (CVA) automatically detected and tracked facial landmarks, which were used to estimate head position and facial expressions (Positive, Neutral, All Other). Using CVA, specific points throughout the movies were identified that reliably differentiate between children with and without ASD based on their patterns of facial movement and expressions (area under the curves for individual movies ranging from 0.62 to 0.73). During these instances, children with ASD more frequently displayed Neutral expressions compared to children without ASD, who had more All Other expressions. The frequency of All Other expressions was driven by non-ASD children more often displaying raised eyebrows and an open mouth, characteristic of engagement/interest. Preliminary results suggest computational coding of facial movements and expressions via a tablet-based assessment can detect differences in affective expression, one of the early, core features of ASD. Lay Summary This study tested the use of a tablet in the behavioral assessment of young children with autism. Children watched a series of developmentally appropriate movies and their facial expressions were recorded using the camera embedded in the tablet. Results suggest that computational assessments of facial expressions may be useful in early detection of symptoms of autism.

AB  - With the increasing use of smartphones in web surveys, considerable efforts have been devoted to reduce the amount of screen space taken up by questions. An emerging stream of research in this area is aimed at optimizing the design elements of rating scales. One suggestion that has been made is to completely abandon verbal labels and use only numeric labels instead. This approach deliberately shifts the task of scale interpretation to the respondents and reduces the information given to them with an intention to reduce their response burden while still preserving the scale meaning. Following prior research, and by drawing on the established model of the cognitive response process, we critically tested these assumptions. Based on a web survey experiment, we found that omitting verbal labels and using only numeric labels instead pushed respondents to focus their responses on the endpoints of a rating scale. Moreover, drawing on response time paradata, we showed that their response burden was not reduced when presented with only numeric labels; quite the opposite was the case, especially when respondents answered the scale with only numeric labels for the first time, which seemed to entail additional cognitive effort. Based on our findings, we advise against using only numeric labels for rating scales in web surveys.

AB  - This study examines the role of IT identity, maladaptive cognitions, and maladaptive emotions on problematic online gaming. By collecting multiwave survey data, embeddedness, self-efficacy, and perceived enjoyment are found to be key determinants of IT identity. Furthermore, IT identity positively influences intrusive thought, thought suppression, emotion irreplaceability, and negative emotion anticipation. Finally, intrusive thought, thought suppression, and negative emotion anticipation collectively predict problematic online gaming and fully mediate the effect of IT identity on problematic online gaming. This study contributes to the literature by offering noteworthy insights on the formation of problematic online gaming and identifying implications for effectively curbing problematic online gaming.

AB  - Objective: Half of US children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have attempted to elope from adult supervision at least once, elevating their risk for serious injury/death. This study aimed to assess, in a sample of children with ASD aged 4 to 18 years who had previously wandered, whether electronic tracking device (ETD) use is associated with changes in the elopement behavior and household quality of life (QOL). Methods: An anonymous, online questionnaire assessing elopement interventions, elopement behavior, household QOL, attitudes toward ETDs, and sociodemographics was distributed via US autism-related organizations to caregivers of children with ASD. Differences in retrospective estimates of elopement behavior and household QOL before ETD use and during ETD use were evaluated using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Results: A total of 2563 participants completed the questionnaire; 1459 participants met the inclusion criteria. For the current (n = 361) and past (n = 96) ETD users, ETD use was associated with decreased frequency and duration of elopement and decreased risk for serious injury because of elopement (allp< 0.001). ETD use was similarly associated with improvements across all 5 measures of QOL. Among the past ETD users, reasons for discontinuation included device discomfort/fit (33.3%), burden of use (27.1%), and financial cost (14.6%). Among the non-ETD users (n = 1002), common barriers to ETD use were cost (47.5%) and lack of awareness of ETD technology (18.8%). Conclusion: Electronic tracking devices represent a promising technology to help safeguard the well-being of children with ASD while reducing the emotional toll that elopement imposes on families. Cost concerns, burden of use, and lack of awareness seem to limit the widespread adoption of ETDs.

AB  - This study explored the social repercussions of preadolescents' mobile device use within the family context by testing two opposing predictions regarding the impact of technology on the quality of interpersonal relationships. Specifically, we examined whether smartphone and tablet use was positively related to preadolescents' self-disclosure to their parents and/or displaced family time, which we hypothesized to be related to children's satisfaction with family life. Results of a cross-sectional survey (n=698, 49.6% girls, Mage= 10.9, SD = 0.69) provided support for both hypotheses, thus corroborating the presence of at least two diverging pathways that underlie this relationship. Although mobile device use seemed to foster a context that supported children's self-disclosure to their parents, results also indicated a negative and indirect association through children's perceived family time. This negative pathway, however, did not hold when social use among children and parents (e.g., playing games together online) was considered separately.

AB  - The growing smartphone penetration and the integration of smartphones into people's everyday practices offer researchers opportunities to augment survey measurement with smartphone-sensor measurement or to replace self-reports. Potential benefits include lower measurement error, a widening of research questions, collection of in situ data, and a lowered respondent burden. However, privacy considerations and other concerns may lead to nonparticipation. To date, little is known about the mechanisms of willingness to share sensor data by the general population, and no evidence is available concerning the stability of willingness. The present study focuses on survey respondents' willingness to share data collected using smartphone sensors (GPS, camera, and wearables) in a probability-based online panel of the general population of the Netherlands. A randomized experiment varied study sponsor, framing of the request, the emphasis on control over the data collection process, and assurance of privacy and confidentiality. Respondents were asked repeatedly about their willingness to share the data collected using smartphone sensors, with varying periods before the second request. Willingness to participate in sensor-based data collection varied by the type of sensor, study sponsor, order of the request, respondent's familiarity with the device, previous experience with participating in research involving smartphone sensors, and privacy concerns. Willingness increased when respondents were asked repeatedly and varied by sensor and task. The timing of the repeated request, one month or six months after the initial request, did not have a significant effect on willingness.

AB  - This paper finds that policy mixes for mobile broadband diffusion need to be differentiated depending on where a country is situated in three stages of mobile broadband diffusion because as a mobile broadband market grows, demand constraints hindering subscription of mobile broadband will also change. A total of 115 countries are clustered into three groups (Take-off, Fast-Diffusion, and Saturated), categorized by their diffusion rates and diffusion speeds over four years from 2013 to 2016. With pooled and fixed effect panel data models, this paper examines which variables out of 23 explanatory variables were effective in promoting mobile broadband adoption globally. Further, by interacting explanatory variables with two group dummies, this paper identifies differential slope (policy) effects of each explanatory variable on mobile broadband adoption. The paper concludes that, among the three groups, considerable gaps exist in the size of effective policy choice sets: six for Take-off, ten for Fast-diffusion, and thirteen for Saturated, suggesting that the countries in the Take-off stage have a very narrow degree of latitude for developing mobile broadband promotion strategies.

AB  - Mobile applications are increasingly regarded as important tools for an integrated strategy of infection containment in post-lockdown societies around the globe. This paper discusses a number of questions that should be addressed when assessing the ethical challenges of mobile applications for digital contact-tracing of COVID-19: Which safeguards should be designed in the technology? Who should access data? What is a legitimate role for "Big Tech" companies in the development and implementation of these systems? How should cultural and behavioural issues be accounted for in the design of these apps? Should use of these apps be compulsory? What does transparency and ethical oversight mean in this context? We demonstrate that responses to these questions are complex and contingent and argue that if digital contract-tracing is used, then it should be clear that this is on a trial basis and its use should be subject to independent monitoring and evaluation.

KW  - MOBILE
AB  - This article compares the factors affecting completion times (CTs) to web survey questions when they are answered using two different devices: personal computers (PCs) and smartphones. Several studies have reported longer CTs when respondents use smartphones than PCs. This is a concern to survey researchers because longer CTs may increase respondent burden and the risk of breakoff. However, few studies have analyzed the specific reasons for the time difference. In this analysis, we analyzed timing data from 836 respondents who completed the same web survey twice, once using a smartphone and once using PC, as part of a randomized crossover experiment in the Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences panel. The survey contained a mix of questions (single choice, numeric entry, and text entry) that were displayed on separate pages. We included both page-level and respondent-level factors that may have contributed to the time difference between devices in cross-classified multilevel models. We found that respondents took about 1.4 times longer when using smartphones than PCs. This difference was larger when a page had more than one question or required text entry. The difference was also larger among respondents who had relatively low levels of familiarity and experience using smartphones. Respondent multitasking was associated with slower CTs, regardless of the device used. Practical implications and avenues for future research are discussed.

AB  - Objective: JUUL-brand electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) contain higher levels of nicotine than other e-cigarettes. The current study examined the relationship between young adults' self-reported addiction and measured JUUL dependence.
   Methods: This study used a sequential, explanatory mixed methods design. Data were collected from a large, southwestern college in the US. College students who were weekly JUUL users and owned a JUUL device (n = 595) completed a cross-sectional online survey, then a subsample (n = 51) participated in in-person interviews. All data were collected between March-April 2019. T-tests were used to examine differences between JUUL dependence and self-reported addiction, and logistic regressions were employed to examine factors that may influence self-reported addiction to JUUL, nicotine, and other e-cigarettes. Interviews were independently coded by 2 coders (kappa ranged from 0.46 to 0.99) then analyzed for corresponding themes.
   Results: Participants who had a higher JUUL dependence were more likely to report addiction to several substances/products, including nicotine, JUULs, cigarettes, other e-cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana. Interview participants minimized JUUL addiction by comparing JUUL to other socially acceptable addictions and describing JUUL addiction as a habit. Interview participants suggested addiction to nicotine was more stigmatizing than JUUL. The number of days participants used JUUL per week, use of traditional tobacco products, and measured JUUL dependence were each associated with self-reported JUUL addiction.
   Conclusions: Social construction of self-reported addictions may be changing young audiences' views of addiction to JUUL. Research is needed to see if using the phrase 'nicotine dependence' rather than 'JUUL addiction' influences young adults' JUUL use.

AB  - Purpose Low response rates in web surveys and the use of different devices in entering web survey responses are the two main challenges to response quality of web surveys. The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of using interviewers to recruit participants in computer-assisted self-administered interviews (CASI) vs computer-assisted personal interviews (CAPI) and smartphones vs computers on participation rate and web survey response quality. Design/methodology/approach Two field experiments using two similar media use studies on US college students were conducted to compare response quality in different survey modes and response devices. Findings Response quality of computer entry was better than smartphone entry in both studies for open-ended and closed-ended question formats. Device effect was only significant on overall completion rate when interviewers were present. Practical implications Survey researchers are given guidance how to conduct online surveys using different devices and choice of question format to maximize survey response quality. The benefits and limitations of using an interviewer to recruit participants and smartphones as web survey response devices are discussed. Social implications It shows how computer-assisted self-interviews and smartphones can improve response quality and participation for underprivileged groups. Originality/value This is the first study to compare response quality in different question formats between CASI, e-mailed delivered online surveys and CAPI. It demonstrates the importance of human factor in creating sense of obligation to improve response quality.

AB  - Digital media availability has surged over the past decade. Because of a lack of comprehensive measurement tools, this rapid growth in access to digital media is accompanied by a scarcity of research examining the family media context and sociocognitive outcomes. There is also little cross-cultural research in families with young children. Modern media are mobile, interactive, and often short in duration, making them difficult to remember when caregivers respond to surveys about media use. The Comprehensive Assessment of Family Media Exposure (CAFE) Consortium has developed a novel tool to measure household media use through a web-based questionnaire, time-use diary, and passive-sensing app installed on family mobile devices. The goal of developing a comprehensive assessment of family media exposure was to take into account the contextual factors of media use and improve upon the limitations of existing self-report measures, while creating a consistent, scalable, and cost-effective tool. The CAFE tool captures the content and context of early media exposure and addresses the limitations of prior media measurement approaches. Preliminary data collected using this measure have been integrated into a shared visualization platform. In this perspective article, we take a tools-of-the-trade approach (Oakes, 2010) to describe four challenges associated with measuring household media exposure in families with young children: measuring attitudes and practices; capturing content and context; measuring short bursts of mobile device usage; and integrating data to capture the complexity of household media usage. We illustrate how each of these challenges can be addressed with preliminary data collected with the CAFE tool and visualized on our dashboard. We conclude with future directions including plans to test reliability, validity, and generalizability of these measures.

AB  - This study investigates the effect of gamified interaction through mobile learning applications (APPs) to optimise users' learning performance. This paper draws on social presence theory and social support theory to construct a model of gamified interaction. We conducted a survey questionnaire with a sample of 368 users from English learning APPs and used structural equation modelling to assess their learning performance. Our results reveal that not all dimensions of gamified interaction enhance learning performance directly. Some dimensions of gamified interaction can optimise users' social presence and perceived social support, which in turn, improve users' learning performance. In addition, learning style can influence users' sense of social presence and perceived social support when they are facing the same gamified interactions. This study highlights the important determinants influencing users' learning performance in the context of gamified mobile learning by incorporating three overlooked factors, gamified interaction, users' learning experience and learning style. For managers of those learning APPs who want to attract more users it is advisable to carry out various gamified interactions through differentiated gamified tools based on users' learning style, which can meet users' psychological needs and thereby enhance effective learning experience.

AB  - Background: In recent years, the Fear of Missing Out (FoMO) construct has been the object of growing attention in digital technology research with previous studies finding support for the relationship between FoMO and problematic smartphone use (PSU) among adolescents and young adults. However, no previous studies clarified the causal link between FoMO and PSU using a longitudinal design.
   Methods: An auto-regressive, cross-lagged panel design was tested by using a longitudinal dataset with two waves of data collection (T0 and T1, one year apart). Participants included two hundred and forty-two adolescents (109 males and 133 females), with a mean age of 14.16 years, who filled out the Fear of Missing Out scale (FoMOs) and the Smartphone Addiction Scale (SAS). Moreover, participants filled out the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), at the first time-point of data collection.
   Results: The findings of the study show that FoMO (both FoMO-Fear and FoMO-Control subscales) and PSU are positively related at both time-points (i.e. at a cross-sectional level). However no cross-lagged associations between them were longitudinally supported. Females and older adolescents show higher FoMO-Fear at T1.
   Conclusions: The findings of the present study suggest caution when causal links between FoMO and PSU are inferred.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the role of mobile-based student response systems in teaching to improve university students' academic outcomes. Mobile devices can be useful tools for conveying content to large classes, with a potential impact on academic outcomes. This study involved a total of 294 undergraduates taking a psychology course. The course involved lessons in the classroom, which included answering quizzes (quiz activities) and activities such as preparing reports and laboratory experiences (out-of-class activities). Quizzes were administered using a mobile technology system. Data were collected on the motivational beliefs (theory of intelligence) and self-regulated learning strategies of students who voluntarily completed the online questionnaires. The results of the linear models showed that using the quizzes positively affected the performance in the final exams (involving closed and open questions). The same was true for the out-of-class activities. The motivation and strategy scores correlated moderately with out-of-class activities, but not with quiz activities. These results offer insight on the use of technology during lessons and other course-related activities to promote academic achievement.

AB  - The landscape of couple leisure time has shifted to include and, in some relationships, rely upon technology use. Technology has the potential to intrude upon face-to-face interactions and quality time together - i.e., technoference, phubbing. However, it is also likely that couples engage in shared technology use, which could lead to bonding. In the current work, we examined one's own, one's partner's, and shared technology use during couple time across 10 days and the potential impacts on couple-time satisfaction, conflict, and relationship quality. We utilized data from 145 couples who completed a baseline online survey and 10 days of daily online surveys concerning leisure time spent together with their partner and their technology use. Multilevel mediational modeling revealed within-person associations between own and partner technology use with daily leisure satisfaction and leisure conflict. Small, but significant within-person indirect effects on daily relationship quality through leisure satisfaction and conflict were also found for own and partner technology use. In other words, results implied a pathway where technology use impacts one's satisfaction with and conflict during time spent together, and then this (dis) satisfaction and conflict impacts daily relationship quality. Although shared technology use was also a significant predictor, its effects were not robust.

AB  - This study explores mobile phone use among people experiencing homelessness in downtown Los Angeles. It explores usage patterns and connectivity challenges, and how these affect access to social services as well as opportunities for information seeking, skills building, and social capital formation. To characterize the unreliable conditions under which this population uses mobile phones, we introduce the concept ofaccess instabilityto capture not simply the obstacles to technology access imposed by poverty but more broadly those stemming from a combination of poverty, housing insecurity, and discrimination. The study is primarily based on a survey among adults experiencing homelessness (or at risk of) conducted over a span of 5 months, complemented by findings from a participatory research intervention carried out in collaboration with a local advocacy organization. Among the key findings is that reliable access to electrical power represents a fundamental yet understudied barrier to mobile use among marginalized populations, including (but not limited to) those experiencing homelessness. Lacking a safe and reliable place to charge their devices, the unstably housed must activate coping strategies that limit digital engagement and constrain use. Overall, access instability disrupts the expectation of constant reachability that underpins modern economic and social relations. Ultimately, this narrows pathways out of homelessness by limiting the ability to gain or sustain employment, to connect with healthcare providers and other vital resources, and to maintain networks of personal support.

AB  - Augmented reality (AR) is a rapidly emerging technology that superimposes digital objects onto real-world scenes as viewed in real time through a smartphone, tablet, or headset. Whereas AR has been adopted for retail, entertainment, and professional training, it also has potential as a novel, mobile, and efficacious treatment modality for psychological disorders. In particular, extinction-based therapies (e.g., anxiety, substance use disorders) could utilize AR to present stimuli in natural environments, enhancing generalizability beyond the clinic. The limited psychological literature on AR has focused on the treatment of simple phobias. Here, with the goal of bringing this technology to the attention of clinicians and researchers, we describe AR, contrast it with virtual reality, review the theoretical foundation for extinction-based therapies, provide examples for the treatment of substance use disorders, and identify theoretical, practical, and implementation-based research questions.

AB  - Successful inclusion is a subject that addresses the question of how well a society can prevent discrimination and ensure access to information, products, services, and spaces for all. Disability may not necessarily lead to exclusion, unless society fails to respond to the needs of people regardless of their impairment. Digital tools combined with ethnographic research may help researchers explore users' needs, perceptions, behaviors, and attitudes and can aid in understanding the interactions between the human, the space, and the digital within the urban realm. This paper thus outlines a diversity of digital tools in the context of the disability-inclusive city. Through ethnographic encounters with Joe, Ann, and Vanessa, we then explore how these tools can be applied to practice. Centering on Joe, we attempt to exemplify some of the key issues that need to be addressed when looking into the terrain of disability, the city, and digital tools.Points of interest This paper explores how mobile phones and mobile applications can support people with disabilities in accessing the city and its services. The research also explores how modern technology, such as mobile applications can support city officials in understanding better what makes cities more disability friendly. With the help of Joe, Vanessa and Ann from Maribor, Slovenia, the authors have tried out a selected number of mobile applications and observed how these can help people with disabilities use the city and its services. The research with Joe, Vanessa and Ann showed that mobile phones and mobile applications can be useful for moving around the city, but people with disabilities may still face difficulties using mobile phones while moving. The research also showed that technology can make cities more disability friendly, but it cannot remove all the barriers that people with disabilities face in their everyday lives.

AB  - Mobile phones are the most accessible information and communication technology today, and they serve as the gateway to high-speed internet for large populations in developing economies. However, despite the progress, there remains a persistent disparity in mobile phone usage among users, and between users and non-users, in developing countries. However, the literature on the digital divide has paid limited attention to the multi-level nature of this gap in mobile phone adoption and use, particularly in developing countries. This research paper provides a comparative analysis of this divide in mobile phone usage in eight developing nations from Africa and Asia. Broadly, the study categorises individuals into three groups: mobile phone non-users, mobile phone users who do not use internet applications and mobile phone users who use applications that need internet access. The disparity between these users was analysed using micro-level survey data from each country. The study results show that the nature of the divide varies across countries and that the influence of socio-demographic factors is not consistent. Further, we find that there is a larger digital divide in terms of mobile phone usage in Asian countries when compared to African countries. The study recommends that policymakers and international agencies exercise caution while developing one-size-fits-all cross-country policies to address the multi-level digital divide.

AB  - Purpose - Following the recommendation of the food and agriculture organization of the United Nations in agricultural innovation, for taking advantage of emerging technologies, in benefit of small-farmers, the present study explores one of the most ancient crops in the world that privileging the application of tacit knowledge, to become a succulent plant called agave, into the so-called drink of the gods, the mezcal. For this, the purpose of this study is to discover innovation opportunities and reconfiguring knowledge interaction dynamics of the agricultural artisan production of agave-mezcal from Oaxaca, Mexico, using emerging technologies
   Design/methodology/approach - Following a qualitative-quantitative approach, the study was carried out with 44 mezcal producers from Oaxaca, Mexico, through face-to-face session, questionaries' application and field visits, based on the model of socialization, externalization, combination and internalization (SECI) through Likert-scale questions, combining the non-parametric statistical analysis and digital compass, for the detection of technological opportunities
   Findings - Basing on artisanal process, context-knowledge place, technological resources and SECIs model results, the opportunities must go in the route of labour in the logic of digital performance. In this sense, becomes relevant to develop an easy-use mobile application for improving the interaction of mezcaleros with external agents and another's producers., A second proposal is the creation of mezcaltech-hub, thinking as collaborative space, for promoting the interaction producer-to-producer and producer-to-external agent.
   Originality/value - The value of the present study is the empirical description of knowledge dynamics interaction contained in the agricultural artisan production of agave-mezcal through SECI model; the identification of problems, failure or barriers contained in the knowledge interaction dynamics of the agricultural artisan production agave-mezcal; the proposal of innovation opportunities for reconfiguring the knowledge interaction dynamics of the agricultural artisan production agave-mezcal from a developing economy, using emerging technologies

AB  - Smartphone use is ubiquitous, however, scholarly debate regarding the addictive nature of smartphones abounds. In this context, it is integral to distinguish between the content that users experience and the medium that facilitates access to the former, as users may experience addictive-like responses to the specific activities they engage in through the context experienced rather than the device that facilitates access to these activities. The present study aimed to explore conceptualizations of smartphone addiction by (a) investigating user preferences for specific smartphone functionalities, (b) examining behavioral changes associated with limited access to preferred functionalities, and (c) exploring links between aspects of smartphone use and self-reported psychological well-being. A total of 471 participants completed an online survey, providing data on sociodemographics, actual and hypothetical smartphone usage, and psychological well-being (depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms). The results showed that communication functionalities were most frequently cited as being preferred among smartphone users. Notably, participants reported that they would check their smartphones significantly fewer times if their top-three functionalities were inaccessible. This suggests that smartphone users are likely to become addicted to the functionalities they access on their smartphones (content) and not the smartphones themselves (medium), rendering unviable the notion of smartphone addiction as a construct. Further analyses suggested negligible to small correlations between aspects of smartphone use and psychological well-being variables. The findings imply that rather than focusing on frequency of smartphone use, it is recommended that future research examines the type and quality of specific smartphone usages and their effects on user well-being.

AB  - Purpose This research investigates whether and how perceived firm remorse (PFR) influences consumers' coping behaviors in the digital media service recovery context. It also examines how an apology should be delivered to generate PFR. Design/methodology/approach In Study 1, 452 mobile application service users were recruited for a survey study, and Structural Equation Modeling was used to test the research hypotheses. In Study 2, 1,255 mobile application service users were recruited for an experimental study. Findings Study 1 shows that PFR negatively influences blame attribution and positively influences emotional empathy. Emotional empathy negatively affects coping behaviors. According to this study, blame attribution and emotional empathy do not have any serial mediation effect on the relationship between PFR and coping behaviors. Only emotional empathy mediates the effect of PFR on coping behaviors. Study 2 finds that response time and apology mode jointly influence PFR. Research limitations/implications This research establishes the relationship between PFR and coping behaviors and shows the mediating role of emotional empathy in this relationship. Practical implications Service providers should consider response time and apology mode, as the two factors jointly influence the extent of PFR, which affects consumers' coping behaviors through emotional empathy. A grace period, in which PFR does not decrease, is present when a public apology is offered. Such an effect does not exist when a private apology is offered. Originality/value This research explains how PFR influences coping behaviors and demonstrates how apology mode moderates the effect of response time on PFR in the digital media service recovery context.

AB  - The ubiquity of internet-capable mobile devices enables individuals to use online communication and social networking sites (SNSs) almost anytime and anywhere, which may foster addictive usage patterns. SNSs provide manifold options and suggestions for social contacts and experiences, which can increase social comparison processes that potentially cause negative affective states, such as envy, dissatisfaction, or fear of missing out (FoMO). This empirical study (N= 226) investigates associations between the tendencies to maximize outcomes and to procrastinate and problematic social networks use. We assume socially driven cognitions such as FoMO and the tendency to switch or cancel appointments at short notice, named "social zapping," to mediate these effects. We tested the hypothesized effects through structural equation modeling. The results confirm positive associations between the mentioned constructs. Procrastination fully mediated the effect of maximization on problematic social networks use. Furthermore, FoMO mediated the effects of both maximization and procrastination. The findings indicate that tendencies to maximize and to procrastinate lead to problematic SNS use, especially in cases where specific fears and intentions to find/to not miss a potentially "better" alternative for social experiences are high. Potential relationships and reinforcement mechanisms in the developmental process of problematic social networks use are discussed.

AB  - The rise of increasingly more powerful chatbots offers a new way to collect information through conversational surveys, where a chatbot asks open-ended questions, interprets a user's free-text responses, and probes answers whenever needed. To investigate the effectiveness and limitations of such a chatbot in conducting surveys, we conducted a field study involving about 600 participants. In this study with mostly open-ended questions, half of the participants took a typical online survey on Qualtrics and the other half interacted with an AI-powered chatbot to complete a conversational survey. Our detailed analysis of over 5,200 free-text responses revealed that the chatbot drove a significantly higher level of participant engagement and elicited significantly better quality responses measured by Gricean Maxims in terms of their informativeness, relevance, specificity, and clarity. Based on our results, we discuss design implications for creating AI-powered chatbots to conduct effective surveys and beyond.

AB  - Although theory suggests that financial market imperfections - mainly information asymmetries, market segmentation and transaction costs - prevent poor people from escaping poverty by limiting their access to formal financial services, new financial technologies (FinTech) are seen as key enablers of financial inclusion. Indeed, the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (UN-2030-ASD) and the G20 High-Level Principles for Digital Financial Inclusion (G20-HLP-DFI) highlight the importance of harnessing the potential of FinTech to reduce financial exclusion and income inequality. This paper investigates the interrelationship between FinTech, financial inclusion and income inequality for a panel of 140 countries using the Global Findex waves of survey data for 2011, 2014 and 2017. We posit that FinTech affects inequality directly and indirectly through financial inclusion. We invoke quantile regression analysis to investigate whether such effects differ across countries with different levels of income inequality. We uncover new evidence that financial inclusion is a key channel through which FinTech reduces income inequality. We also find that while financial inclusion significantly reduces inequality at all quantiles of the inequality distribution, these effects are primarily associated with higher-income countries. Overall, our results support the aspirations of the UN-2030-ASD and G20-HLP-DFI.

AB  - Digital media (DM) is omnipresent in society today and impacts every aspect of our life. Previous studies have shown DM to cause problems in interpersonal relationships by creating problematic interruptions in interactions, this has been termed technoference. The current study focuses on parent's self-rated perceived technoference and the rated behavior of their 4- to 5-year-old children. Parents (N = 153) filled out an online questionnaire regarding family DM use and technoference as well as questions regarding their child's behavior. Parents rated the level of technoference caused by their own use of DM as well as the rate of technoference caused by the child's use of DM. Parents were also asked questions regarding their own possible problematic cell phone use. The findings reveal a statistically significant contribution of technoference, caused by the parents' use of DM, to the behavior repertoire of the children.

AB  - Nepali information and communication technology (ICT) policies, informed by dominant international discourses on internet and ICT for development, have attributed a 'self-evident' positive impact to economic growth. Such a conception is inconclusive and hides the underlying socioeconomic inequalities and the barriers they oppose to universal connectivity ambitions. The self-evident discourse overlooks the importance of adjacent infrastructures like electricity, critical for efficient functioning of a 'digital society'. History has shown Nepal's eagerness to buy the irrational exuberance of the dot-com era. It also shows policy targets were not based on local evidence and experiences. While the question about when the next bubble will emerge and burst is debatable, the techno-deterministic arguments need to be checked in light of evidence. We offer insights from import trajectories since the drafting of the first IT policy. The proliferation of mobile phones is explored in light of data consumption (i.e., usage) and access during the deadly earthquake in 2015. The evidence clearly highlights the mismatch between connectivity ambitions and socioeconomic realities in a stratified information society. We contend that the self-evident visions of connectivity need to be checked empirically. We call for internet and ICT policies that have a nuanced conceptualisation of access and its gradation.

AB  - Objective: To outline the development and evaluation of an online infertility peer supporter training program.
   Methods: Men and women with diverse infertility backgrounds were recruited and trained to provide online peer support to people undergoing fertility treatment. Training required volunteers to (1) read a peer support training manual, (2) watch a webinar, and (3) complete practice questions, each of which was evidence-based and reviewed by key stakeholders.
   Results: Seventeen women and one man were trained and provided online peer support. Program satisfaction was high and training materials were rated as helpful. Peer supporters felt comfortable providing support and having their discussions monitored. They liked helping others and the convenience of a mobile application.
   Conclusion: Online recruitment and training of infertility peer supporters is feasible. The current program was acceptable and offers steps for improving future online peer support interventions.
   Practice implications: Current evidence supports the acceptability and feasibility of this training and supervision program, and provides service providers with information guiding its development and implementation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The popularity of multiplayer online battle arena games is closely linked to customer engagement. The purpose is to investigate the influences that individual motivators and environmental antecedents have upon customer engagement and continuous playing games intention, and compare the impacts between playing Multiplayer online battle arena games on personal computers and on mobile phones. A Triadic reciprocal determinism framework was developed to explain the relationship among individual motivator (flow experience), environmental antecedents (technical features and social interaction), individual behavior (continuous playing games intention), and customer engagement within multiplayer online battle arena gaming settings. Altogether 531 questionnaires from multiplayer online battle arena players were collected. Structural equation modeling with Smart-partial least squares was used to evaluate the research model. The findings suggest that the influence of flow experience on customer engagement in personal computers gaming is more significant than that in mobile gaming, while the effects of perceived ease of use and offline social interaction on customer engagement in mobile gaming are comparatively higher. This study indicates the importance of flow experience, perceived control, perceived ease of use, and social interaction in the Multiplayer online battle arena gaming development and the prosperity for better customers engaged, and to enhance customer experience.

AB  - Purpose
   Mobile phones have become one of the most favored devices to maintain social connections as well as logging digital information about personal lives. The privacy of the metadata being generated in this process has been a topic of intense debate over the last few years, but most of the debate has been focused on stonewalling such data. At the same time, such metadata is already being used to automatically infer a user's preferences for commercial products, media, or political agencies. The purpose of this paper is to understand the predictive power of phone usage features on individual privacy attitudes.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The present study uses a mixed-method approach, involving analysis of mobile phone metadata, self-reported survey on privacy attitudes and semi-structured interviews. This paper analyzes the interconnections between user's social and behavioral data as obtained via their phone with their self-reported privacy attitudes and interprets them based on the semi-structured interviews.
   Findings
   The findings from the study suggest that an analysis of mobile phone metadata reveals vital clues to a person's privacy attitudes. This study finds that multiple phone signals have significant predictive power on an individual's privacy attitudes. The results motivate a newer direction of automatically inferring a user's privacy attitudes by leveraging their phone usage information.
   Practical implications
   An ability to automatically infer a user's privacy attitudes could allow users to utilize their own phone metadata to get automatic recommendations for privacy settings appropriate for them. This study offers information scientists, government agencies and mobile app developers, an understanding of user privacy needs, helping them create apps that take these traits into account.
   Originality/value
   The primary value of this paper lies in providing a better understanding of the predictive power of phone usage features on individual privacy attitudes.

AB  - Online technologies are viewed as a potential equalizer of opportunities for marginalized groups because they may help reduce inequality and oppression through their educational, social and professional capabilities. While many forms of political participation are increasingly mediatized by online technologies, very few studies have examined the extent to which citizens with disabilities use them to engage in democracy. This article addresses this challenge by examining how internet access for people with disabilities compares to others, whether people with disabilities are equally or more likely to use the internet to participate in politics, and the digital skills of users with disabilities. It draws on a phone survey conducted among a representative sample of the Canadian population. We find that Canadians with disabilities are less likely to access online technologies and that disabled users with low digital skills face additional barriers. However, disabled users whose knowledge allows them to make the most of the Internet are as likely - or even more likely - as non-disabled users to participate online in politics.

AB  - Driven by the rapid adoption of Internet-based technologies amongst producers in the Global South, the question of how and whether global value chain arrangements are reconfigured remains open to debate. This article addresses the changing practices of export-oriented smallholders accompanying the transition from simple phone towards smartphone use. Our dynamic approach compares cross-sectional survey data from 2013 and 2017 to answer to what extent Kenyan smallholders have adopted the Internet, which digital practices in relation to agricultural value chains they use and how this affects the inter-firm coordination between smallholders and subsequent actors. Smartphones have gained broad importance for smallholders as they are used for digital practices in value chains. Contrary to the debated dark sides of Internet connectivity, we can however not confirm sweeping digital control or value appropriation by lead firms. So far, long-established, analogue practices widely persist in arrangements between smallholders and exporters. Nevertheless, smartphones are used to nurture multilateral knowledge networks of unprecedented reach and size and further allow for incipient experiments with marketing strategies on digital marketing platforms devoted to domestic markets. We argue that these practices resemble strategic niche seeking that has to be interpreted in relation to captive export arrangements. With qualitatively and quantitatively increasing options to access and share knowledge and to market commodities, the Internet can serve to navigate the multiplicity of chain alternatives (domestic production, informal export production). Such niches should be considered as creating leverage against the take it or leave it deal of captive export production.

AB  - Researchers are combining self-reports from mobile surveys with passive data collection using sensors and apps on smartphones increasingly more often. While smartphones are commonly used in some groups of individuals, smartphone penetration is significantly lower in other groups. In addition, different operating systems (OSs) limit how mobile data can be collected passively. These limitations cause concern about coverage error in studies targeting the general population. Based on data from the Panel Study Labour Market and Social Security (PASS), an annual probability-based mixed-mode survey on the labor market and poverty in Germany, we find that smartphone ownership and ownership of smartphones with specific OSs are correlated with a number of sociodemographic and substantive variables. The use of weighting techniques based on sociodemographic information available for both owners and nonowners reduces these differences but does not eliminate them.

AB  - This article analyses the modes of physical access that facilitate participation in digital opportunities and the development of digital skills in children and adolescents (9 to 17 years old). We analysed the data obtained from the Kids Online survey in Chile. A latent class analysis (LCA) was conducted to identify groups based on access points and devices of use; access modalities were then composed crossing these variables. Four access modalities were found: cellphone-home; cellphone-ubiquitous; multi-device-home; multi-device-ubiquitous. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that ubiquitous modalities (multi-device and cellphone varieties) predicted digital use and skills among young Chileans, while the more static modalities (cellphone and home and multi-device and home) did not. These results are critical to addressing what can be defined as "enabling access" among young Internet users in the context of digital inclusion policies.

AB  - Greece is one of the few European countries that has not yet a fully operating Cadastre at national coverage. Cadastral surveying and property registration have been completed only for about 8% of the Greek territory, which includes about 18% of the total property rights. At the remaining areas, cadastral surveying and property registration is still under development and is expected to be completed by the end of 2021. The cadastral survey is a participatory procedure in which property right holders, or their representatives, are expected to declare the land parcels on which they have property rights and submit all documents that prove these rights. The time frame available for the declaration is 3 months, which is specific for each municipality. Right holders are now enabled to provide both spatial and descriptive information, regarding their properties and property rights, without the need of a professional. That includes the parcel's boundary lines along with the legal documents required to validate the declaration. Each right holder, or a representative, has the option to submit a declaration over the internet through a web application without the need of a professional. Within the frame of a PhD research, several concerns were addressed such as usability, security, and scalability in order for the outcome to support its scope while respecting binding constrains. As a result, two web applications have been created to officially support the Hellenic Cadaster property rights declaration process. The suggested approach was considered a big success in terms of both public acceptance and usability as shown from the statistics collected during the first eight months of its formal operation.

AB  - We implemented an experiment within a smartphone web survey to explore the feasibility of using voice input (VI) options. Based on device used, participants were randomly assigned to a treatment or control group. Respondents in the iPhone operating system (iOS) treatment group were asked to use the dictation button, in which the voice was translated automatically into text by the device. Respondents with Android devices were asked to use a VI button which recorded the voice and transmitted the audio file. Both control groups were asked to answer open-ended questions using standard text entry. We found that the use of VI still presents a number of challenges for respondents. Voice recording (Android) led to substantially higher nonresponse, whereas dictation (iOS) led to slightly higher nonresponse, relative to text input. However, completion time was significantly reduced using VI. Among those who provided an answer, when dictation was used, we found fewer valid answers and less information provided, whereas for voice recording, longer and more elaborated answers were obtained. Voice recording (Android) led to significantly lower survey evaluations, but not dictation (iOS).

AB  - Although research on smart cars has rapidly expanded, relatively little attention has been paid to improving users' emotional experiences. This research was based on a petmorphic design approach, which defines design attributes assuming an intelligent device can interact like a pet dog. In this paper, we present a set of pet-dog behavioral traits (PBT) and their application in enhancing emotional interaction in smart cars. Firstly, using an interview-based explorative study, we identified key pet-dog characteristics that elicit affection in owners and four PBTs that could be used to design smart car interactions: self-expression, empathy, faithfulness and innocence. Secondly, we conducted an online survey-based study to examine how PBTs can be incorporated into smart cars for different scenarios. The results indicated that faithfulness was typically preferred in routine scenarios while traits associated with innocence were less preferred. We discuss the desirable use cases for each PBT and how PBT can be applied as a function of autonomy according to the urgency of a situation. We also discuss how PBT could enhance users' emotional experiences by increasing agreeability, emotional bonding, delightfulness and generous attitudes.

AB  - The objectives of this research were to: (1) identify Mobile Computer Terminal (MCT) human factors issues, (2) formulate guidelines and an enhanced MCT for improving interface design and implementation in police patrols, and (3) identify areas of future research to fill gaps in the literature. A systematic literature search was conducted leading to results categorized in four groups including: productivity, physical discomfort, interface usability, and driving distraction. Although MCT use has increased officer productivity, several usability issues need to be resolved. The MCT has also increased officer physical discomfort and distraction. MCT design and implementation guidelines that resolve human factors issues in police patrols were identified along with an enhanced design concept. Guidelines for MCT design were validated with an online survey completed by 81 police officers. Future research directions were proposed to recognize police officer needs and work context.

AB  - Offering participants in mobile app studies personalized feedback on the data they report seems an obvious thing to do: Participants might expect an app to provide feedback given their experiences with commercial apps, feedback might motivate more people to participate in the study, and participants might be more motivated to provide accurate data so that the feedback is more useful to them. However, personalized feedback might lead participants to change the behavior that is being measured with the app, is costly to implement, and also constrains other design decisions for the data collection. In this article, we report on an experimental study that tested the effects of providing personalized feedback in a 1-month mobile app-based spending study. Based on the app paradata and responses to a debrief survey, it seems that participants reacted positively to the feedback. The feedback did not have the potential negative effect of altering the spending participants reported in the app. However, the feedback also did not have the intended effect of increasing initial participation or ongoing adherence to the study protocol.

AB  - The digital revolution and the ongoing dissemination of mobile phones carry several prospects for smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. Food insecurity and low dietary quality remain major issues among African smallholders. Mobile phones could potentially facilitate access to food markets and thus improve food security and nutrition, but research on such types of effects remains scarce. In this study, we analyze whether mobile phones improve dietary quality among pastoral communities in Northern Kenya. We use six rounds of household panel data covering the period between 2009 and 2015. During this period, mobile phone ownership in the sample increased from less than 30% to more than 70%. Regression models with household fixed effects allow robust estimation while reducing potential issues of unobserved heterogeneity. The estimates show that mobile phone adoption and use are positively and significantly associated with dietary diversity. The effects are particularly large for frequent mobile phone users. We also examine the underlying mechanisms. Mobile phone use improves dietary diversity mainly through better access to purchased foods. These results encourage the promotion of mobile phone technologies as a valuable tool for nutritional improvements, especially in remote rural settings with poor access to food markets.

AB  - Although Virtual reality (VR) entertainment is now relatively popular, the adoption of VR devices is still low. In this study, a framework based benefit and sacrifice factors was developed to understand players' intention to use VR devices to play games. Online questionnaire items were developed and published to collect the responses from university students in Taiwan. The feedback of 152 inexperienced players and 150 experienced players were collected. The eleven hypotheses were tested by using SmartPLS, a structural equation modeling (SEM) tool. The analysis results show that the influences of the benefit factors (flow, spatial presence, and relaxation) on the adoption intention in two groups are consistent. All of the positive influences are supported. Moreover, visual fatigue had the strongest negative effects on flow and intention. Players who are opener to new technology are more possible to adopt VR devices. The findings can provide insights to VR device developers to design their VR devices/contents and marketing strategies.

AB  - Although Sweden is one of the most digitalized countries and the Swedish population's use of the internet is among the most studied in the world, little is known about how Swedes with disabilities use internet. The purpose of this study is to describe use of and perceived difficulties in use of the internet among people with disabilities and to explore digital divides in-between and within disability groups, and in comparison with the general population. This is a cross-sectional survey targeting the same issues as other nationwide surveys but adapted for people with cognitive disabilities. Participants were recruited from May to October 2017 by adaptive snowball sampling. The survey comprised questions on access to and use of devices, and use of and perceived difficulties in use of internet. A total of 771 people responded to the survey, representing 35 diagnoses/impairments. Larger proportions of people with autism, ADHD and bipolar disorder reported using internet than other disability groups. Women with autism used the internet more than any other disability group, and women with aphasia used the internet the least. People with disabilities related to language and understanding reported more difficulties using internet than other disability groups. Larger proportions of participants than the general Swedish population reported not feeling digitally included. In many but not all disability groups, larger proportions of men than women reported not feeling digitally included. Our findings show that there are differences in digital inclusion between sub-groups of diagnoses/impairments. Thus, disability digital divides are preferably investigated by sub-grouping disabilities, rather than studied as one homogeneous group.

AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate the determinants for the intention to adopt mobile technology as a data collection methodology in market research projects. A conceptual framework was developed using the technology-organization-environment (TOE) model to identify technological factors (perceived benefits and limitations), organizational factors (open attitude toward change, professional competence, satisfaction with traditional systems, and firm size), and environmental factors (industry pressure, client pressure, and participant pressure) affecting adoption. The empirical study was performed with data from 67 firms in the Spanish market research industry, which were analyzed using partial least squares (PLS). The results suggest that only organizational and environmental factors have a significant influence on adoption. Key factors include professional competence, organizational openness, satisfaction with traditional and online methodologies, and pressure from industry, clients and survey participants. The findings reveal that technological characteristics are no longer a driver, as firms are starting to adopt mobile marketing research based on its greater convenience for participants, and as an element of strategic differentiation.

AB  - While flow has been researched extensively in computer-mediated environments, it has been scarcely researched in the mobile interface context. Specifically, we have virtually no knowledge about what concrete traits of mobile interfaces (as opposed to user perceptions) encourage the flow state. Flow has been associated with many positive outcomes in human-computer interactions, making it vital for practitioners and scholars to understand the traits of mobile interfaces that encourage flow. Therefore, we synthesize the results of a literature search and a modified Delphi study to develop an inventory of traits and perceptions that can promote the flow experience. We provide initial evidence for the predictive validity of our inventory through a survey study which demonstrates that composite ratings of the inventory traits are positively associated with the flow state, which in turn, leads to compulsive usage and technostress. In doing so, this paper also extends flow research by exploring the potential negative outcomes of flow in the mobile interface context.

AB  - A great deal of research effort has been put in exploring crossmodal correspondences in the field of cognitive science which refer to the systematic associations frequently made between different sensory modalities (e.g. high pitch is matched with angular shapes). However, the possibilities cross-modality opens in the digital world have been relatively unexplored. Therefore, we consider that studying the plasticity and the effects of crossmodal correspondences in a mulsemedia setup can bring novel insights about improving the human-computer dialogue and experience. Mulsemedia refers to the combination of three or more senses to create immersive experiences. In our experiments, users were shown six video clips associated with certain visual features based on color, brightness, and shape. We examined if the pairing with crossmodal matching sound and the corresponding auto-generated haptic effect, and smell would lead to an enhanced user QoE. For this, we used an eye-tracking device as well as a heart rate monitor wristband to capture users' eye gaze and heart rate whilst they were experiencing mulsemedia. After each video clip, we asked the users to complete an on-screen questionnaire with a set of questions related to smell, sound and haptic effects targeting their enjoyment and perception of the experiment. Accordingly, the eye gaze and heart rate results showed significant influence of the cross-modally mapped multisensorial effects on the users' QoE. Our results highlight that when the olfactory content is crossmodally congruent with the visual content, the visual attention of the users seems shifted towards the correspondent visual feature. Crosmodally matched media is also shown to result in an enhanced QoE compared to a video only condition.

AB  - Digital technologies have led to the emergence of new forms of flexible work, such as crowdwork or information and communication technology-enabled mobile work, over the past decade. This is considered as a positive development for its high flexibility in hours and place of work, and also for providing employment opportunities to workers in developing countries, individuals with disabilities or those with care responsibilities. This article examines the on-going trend in outsourcing low-skilled work to the crowd through online platforms, and how platform design features and algorithmic management are used by digital labour platforms to assign, monitor and evaluate work. The paper argues that these distinctive features of digital platforms have an impact on working conditions in terms of access to tasks, remuneration and working time flexibility. The paper draws on a global survey of 675 workers on five globally operating platforms in 27 developing countries. Its findings highlight the need for transparency in platform architecture, design and algorithms to ensure that workers are protected from the vulnerabilities they face with digital work.

AB  - Filter questions are used to administer follow-up questions to eligible respondents while allowing respondents who are not eligible to skip those questions. Filter questions can be asked in either the interleafed or the grouped formats. In the interleafed format, the follow-ups are asked immediately after the filter question; in the grouped format, follow-ups are asked after the filter question block. Underreporting can occur in the interleafed format due to respondents' desire to reduce the burden of the survey. This phenomenon is called motivated misreporting. Because smartphone surveys are more burdensome than web surveys completed on a computer or laptop, due to the smaller screen size, longer page loading times, and more distraction, we expect that motivated misreporting is more pronounced on smartphones. Furthermore, we expect that misreporting occurs not only in the filter questions themselves but also extends to data quality in the follow-up questions. We randomly assigned 3,517 respondents of a German online access panel to either the PC or the smartphone. Our results show that while both PC and smartphone respondents trigger fewer filter questions in the interleafed format than the grouped format, we did not find differences between PC and smartphone respondents regarding the number of triggered filter questions. However, smartphone respondents provide lower data quality in the follow-up questions, especially in the grouped format. We conclude with recommendations for web survey designers who intend to incorporate smartphone respondents in their surveys.

AB  - Objective Eating disorder recovery research has emphasized the absence of symptoms over the presence of adaptive aspects like positive body image and healthy eating attitudes. The current study examined how body appreciation and intuitive eating related to eating disorder recovery using a comprehensive recovery definition (physical, behavioral, and cognitive recovery).
   Method Data were collected from 66 women with an eating disorder history and 31 controls with no history of eating pathology. Participants completed an online survey followed by a phone interview.
   Results The fully recovered group did not differ from controls on body appreciation, with both groups endorsing significantly higher levels of body appreciation than the partially recovered and current eating disorder groups. Similarly, the fully recovered group did not differ from controls on overall intuitive eating, with both groups endorsing significantly higher levels of overall intuitive eating than the partially recovered and current eating disorder groups.
   Discussion Positive psychological constructs such as body appreciation and intuitive eating relate to eating disorder recovery status. Understanding recovery within a strengths-based framework may inform intervention and relapse prevention.

AB  - To be able to design indoor wayfinding systems that adhere better to the needs of the users, user perception on complexity needs to be examined and linked to user characteristics and decision point characteristics. To identify how these characteristics influence perception, an online survey is executed in which participants had to indicate how complex they found a decision point, while interpreting a route instruction. The results show that complexity ratings depend both on user characteristics and on the function of the decision point. Decision points to change levels, start or end a route and to take turns each received significantly different complexity ratings. Isovist and visibility graph analysis characteristics of these decision points show that the first two actions were perceived as more complex when they took place in a narrow hallway, while the third action was perceived as more complex in a convex space. The results of this study can be used in the design of an adaptive wayfinding system that adapts the route instructions to the perceived decision point complexity. This adaptation will adhere better to the needs of the users compared to an adaptation based on solely theoretical complexity.

AB  - Introduction: Recently studies examined mediating psychological constructs accounting for relations between both depression and anxiety with problematic smartphone use (PSU) severity. The aim of the current study was to analyze the fear of missing out (FOMO) as a possible mediator in these relationships.
   Method: We recruited 1034 Chinese undergraduate students via a web-based survey that measured smartphone use frequency, PSU, depression, anxiety and FOMO.
   Results: Structural equation modeling demonstrated that FOMO was significantly related to smartphone use frequency and PSU severity. FOMO significantly mediated relations between anxiety and both smartphone use frequency and PSU severity. FOMO did not account for relations between depression and smartphone use/PSU.
   Conclusion: This is one of the first studies testing FOMO in relation to PSU severity among Asian participants. FOMO may be an important variable accounting for why some types of psychopathology (e.g., anxiety) are associated with PSU.

AB  - The goal of this study is to investigate how flow experience and diverse smartphone activities play a role in influencing people's perceived boredom during free time. Through a telephone survey, data were gathered from a probability sample of 653 smartphone users. Results indicate that the more people who engage in pleasure-seeking, short-lived, and diversionary hedonic activities, the stronger the feeling that their physical involvement is lacking. Eudaemonic activities, such as information seeking, significantly predicted a lack of meaningful involvement, while utilities significantly predicted a perceived slowness of time and lack of mental involvement. Findings also revealed that people achieve flow state when they use a smartphone for entertainment, information seeking, and sociability, especially when they feel bored, sense a lack of meaningful involvement, and want their free time to last. Furthermore, the interaction effects found in the study provide a more nuanced view about the ways in which eudaemonic smartphone activities (especially for information seeking and sociability) can interact with flow experience to regulate perceived boredom in free time. This study suggests that app designers should recognize the role of newly developed hedonic and eudaemonic functions of the smartphone which may significantly alleviate perceived boredom in free time.

AB  - With the rising popularity of web surveys and the increasing use of paradata by survey methodologists, assessing information stored in user agent strings becomes inevitable. These data contain meaningful information about the browser, operating system, and device that a survey respondent uses. This article provides an overview of user agent strings, their specific structure and history, how they can be obtained when conducting a web survey, as well as what kind of information can be extracted from the strings. Further, the user written command parseuas is introduced as an efficient means to gather detailed information from user agent strings. The application of parseuas is illustrated by an example that draws on a pooled data set consisting of 29 web surveys.

AB  - Online crowdwork platforms have been praised as powerful vehicles for economic development, particularly for workers traditionally excluded from the labor market. However, there has been insufficient scrutiny as to the feasibility of crowdwork as an income-source among socioeconomically deprived populations. This article examines device requirements and differential access to digital infrastructure, both of which act as potential barriers to not only basic participation but also to economic success online. Given the increasing prevalence of mobile-first and mobile-only populations, research on this topic aids in understanding the crowdwork ecosystem among differing socioeconomic sectors. Based on a survey of 606 crowd workers across the United States and India, this article uses both quantitative and qualitative data to explore whether reliance on mobile devices is detrimental for economic outcomes of crowdwork. The results point to substantial inequalities in device use and received benefits from crowdwork, within each country and between the two contexts.

AB  - We investigated how a lack of trust in one's romantic partner exacerbates problems such as emotional instability, conflict, or intention to break up in relationships with the role of cell phone snooping as a mediator. A cross-sectional survey of married individuals (n = 329) was conducted using an online questionnaire. Results indicate that lack of trust is a significant predictor of romantic relationship problems. In addition, structural equation modeling results support the theoretical model indicating that cell phone snooping partially mediates the significant relationship between emotional instability, intention to break up, and conflicts. Findings support the development of trust in romantic partners as an approach to stability and avoidance of problems in romantic relationships.

AB  - Procrastination on social networking sites (SNS) can impact academic performance and user's well-being. SNSs embed features that encourage users to be always connected and updated, e.g., the notification features. Such persuasive features can exploit peer pressure as well and lead users to believe they are expected to interact immediately, especially for those who may have less impulse control and seek for relatedness and popularity. We argue that SNS can be built to host countermeasures for such behavior and help people regulate their usage and preoccupation about it better. In this paper, we presented a mixed-method study including a qualitative (i.e., focus groups, diary, interviews, and co-design) and a quantitative phase (i.e., a survey) with 334 participants. Through the qualitative phase, we identified: (1) features of an SNS seen by participants as facilitators for procrastination, e.g., notification, immersive design, and surveillance of presence, and (2) countermeasures, such as reminders, chat timer, and goal setting, can be facilitated via SNS design to combat procrastination, and (3) a pairing between the features and the countermeasures. We then (4) confirmed these results and the pairing through the survey phase. Our study showed that countermeasures could be implemented to be universal across all SNS on one or even more device.

AB  - Long self-administered questionnaires may suffer from lower response rates, higher drop-outs, and lower quality responses. A shorter questionnaire reduces the burden of respondents. Using this as a starting point, we test the following method: split the long questionnaire into sub-questionnaires; invite everyone to answer the first sub-questionnaire; when respondents complete the first sub-questionnaire, invite them to answer the second sub-questionnaire, and so on. We present evidence that after splitting a long questionnaire into two shorter parts, the response rates of these sub-questionnaires are significantly higher than the response rate of the original, undivided, long questionnaire. However, the cumulative response rate of both parts is lower than the response rate of the long undivided questionnaire. Finally, we show that the respondents of the survey using the original, long questionnaire: i) provide more non-substantive answers ("neither/nor") to the Likert-type scale items and ii) give shorter answers to the open-ended questions of the survey than the respondents of the split survey. On the other hand, there is no significant difference between the long and the split questionnaire on the other indicators of response quality we have tested: item-nonresponse, speeding and straight-lining. This paper presents some first insights on splitting a long questionnaire into shorter parts. For now, the results are not promising to suggest with confidence to split the long questionnaire for the purpose of obtaining high data quality. Further research is needed to find the optimal interval time between the sub-questionnaires or the optimal length of the sub-questionnaires in which the overall response rate is maximized.

AB  - Hajj, the annual pilgrimage to Makkah, is one of the most massive gathering events in the world. It is a mandatory religious activity, once in a lifetime for every sane well-off Muslim. Every year around 3 million Muslims across the globe visit Makkah to perform this spatiotemporally constrained set of religious activities, like circumambulation around the Kaaba and the encampment at Mina, Arafat and Muzdalifah. The key ritual at Rami-al-Jamarat (the stoning-of-the-pillars) is a place seen particularly crowded. The diversified nature of the crowd in terms of race, age, language and culture brings several administrative challenges for local organizers whose responsibility is to ensure the smooth organization of the event. The advent of digital technologies has helped researchers to explore and propose modern methods for better crowd management and devise control strategies to organize such a mass gathering. In this paper, we present a taxonomy that summarizes our survey on the utilization of technology areas for providing needful services and improving crowd management during the Hajj season. These technologies are Wireless, Computer Vision, Spatial Computing, Data Analytics, Mobile Applications, Immersive Technologies, and Crowd Modelling and Simulation. We have also included the current research work and its implementation plan for Hajj 2020. One dimension of the taxonomy is to understand different possible technologies for Crowd management. Another dimension is to understand the impact of technologies to handle such a massive crowd. The discussion section covers a comparison of technologies with multiple aspects that may help researchers to contribute more towards dealing with future mass gathering events.

AB  - The increased use of smartphones in web survey responding did not only raise new research questions but also fostered new ways to research survey completion behavior. Smartphones have many built-in sensors, such as accelerometers that measure acceleration (i.e., the rate of change of velocity of an object over time). Sensor data establish new research opportunities by providing information about physical completion conditions that, for instance, can affect response quality. In this study, we explore three research questions: (1) To what extent do respondents accept to comply with motion instructions? (2) What variables affect the acceleration of smartphones? (3) Do different motion levels affect response quality? We conducted a smartphone web survey experiment using the Netquest opt-in panel in Spain and asked respondents to stand at a fix point or walk around while answering five single questions. The results reveal high compliance with motion instructions, with compliance being higher in the standing than in the walking condition. We also discovered that several variables, such as the presence of third parties, increase the acceleration of smartphones. However, the quality of responses to the five single questions did not differ significantly between the motion conditions, a finding that is in line with previous research. Our findings provide new insights into how compliance changes with motion tasks and suggest that the collection of acceleration data is a feasible and fruitful way to explore survey completion behavior. The findings also indicate that refined research on the connection between motion levels and response quality is necessary.

AB  - Innovations of information and communication technologies (ICTs) have influenced human life through time-saving, diffusion of knowledge, easy communication, and networks, access to information and automation with artificial intelligence. They not only increase productivity, cut-down hardship, improve transparency and governance, build social capital and empower individuals but also raise risks of cyber threats and insecurity of private life, displace labours, encourage sedentary life-style and digitally divide individuals in the society etc. These together do not seem to have unambiguous impacted on the aggregate wellbeing and progress (WPI) of a nation, and thus this paper empirically examined their resultant relationship at the aggregate level. An index of WPI has been prepared to account for the aggregate level of satisfaction derived from six sources, namely economic, human, progress, cultural, environmental wellbeing and happiness. Similarly, an index of ICT exposure has been constructed by combining access to mobile, internet and telephone connections, and internet security. Using a panel database for 67 countries representing all subcontinents during 2000-2014, we find that ICT exposure positively improves the aggregate level of WPI. The net impact is marginally lower in less-developed and developing countries (e.g., Africa, Asia, and the Middle East) than the rest (e.g., Europe and North America).

AB  - The amount of time adolescents spend communicating via digital technologies such as smartphones has led to concerns that computer-mediated communication (CMC) is displacing face-to-face (FtF) interactions and disrupting social development. Although many studies have examined CMC in adolescents' relationships with friends, few studies have examined the role of CMC in adolescents' renegotiation of closeness and autonomy with parents. To examine this issue, we administered an online daily diary with 169 U.S. adolescents to estimate the time they spend in CMC and FtF interactions and the number of texts they exchange with friends and parents. On the last day of the survey, we asked adolescents about their emotional closeness to friends and parents and their balance of closeness and volition with parents. Overall, we found more evidence for social stimulation than displacement effects of CMC. Texts and CMC time with friends predicted friend closeness after accounting for FtF time with friends; texts with parents predicted parent closeness after accounting for FtF time with parents. We also found support for our hypothesis that CMC would be associated with greater adolescent volition. CMC time with parents predicted greater volitional dependence (volition plus closeness) whereas texts with friends predicted greater independent decision-making (volition plus distance). We discuss how communication technologies are integrated into U.S. adolescents' relationships with friends and parents and how CMC can facilitate, rather than stifle, adolescents' adjustment of autonomy-relatedness with parents and their construction of emotional closeness with friends.

AB  - The ongoing developments in information technology have resulted in new technologies as a replacement for those already existing. This has led to users resorting to these new technologies, often in parallel to the existing offerings. These users then later decide whether to switch to the new technologies fully, a phenomenon referred to as the 'technology transition'. In this paper, drawing on theories on social psychology, we present a theoretical model for explaining technology transition from an individual's perspective in two geographies (Germany and India). Based on survey responses in the two geographies, we validate the model and demonstrate the country-specific factors influencing an individual's intention to transition to a tablet computer from a conventional computing device. The investigation of technology transition at the individual level is also a contribution to the cross-cultural stream of research and provides a basis for further inquiry in this field.

AB  - Header images are typically included in web surveys to make surveys more appealing for respondents. However, headers might also induce a systematic bias in response behavior. In order to examine both the potential effects (more specifically, effects on motivation and context effects) of header images with respondents using different devices, an experiment embedded in a web survey on students' time use and stress was conducted using a probability sample of 1,326 students at the University of Bonn. Respondents were presented either with a picture of an auditorium with students sitting in a class, a picture of leisure activities on campus, or no picture, respectively. To control for position effects, pictures were placed either in the upper right or upper left of the questionnaire. The results indicate that header images attract attention in the beginning of a survey, but do not significantly increase motivation over the course of the survey. When faced with a header picture, respondents in the picture conditions evaluate their time in class differently compared to respondents in the control group. While the device providing the visibility makes no difference, effects are only significant when the picture is placed on the left side of the screen. In sum, the interaction of header placement and the content-related proximity of header content and question may alter response behavior.

AB  - Compulsive smartphone use has attracted extensive social attention because of serious and even fatal outcomes associated with it. However, there has been little theory-driven research systematically investigating the mechanism of compulsive behavior in smartphone use. Although a significant line of literature exists in the area of personal-computer based technology addiction, the mechanism underpinning compulsive smartphone use differs significantly because the unique and specific characteristics of smartphones have given rise to a fundamentally different usage context with new usage behavioral patterns. In order to comprehensively theorize this issue, we first defined compulsive behavior in smartphone use, focusing on mobile social networking services (SNSs) in particular, and then extended the stimulus-response-reinforcement framework to investigate the theoretical network of compulsive use of mobile SNSs. We used online survey data from 368 active mobile SNS users in China to empirically test and validate the proposed model and hypotheses. Our results indicate that both positive and negative reinforcements, as well as the compensatory component, invoke the feeling of urge that leads to compulsive mobile SNS use. The positive effects of interactivity as an incentive stimulus on those reinforcements and compulsive mobile SNS use were also found to be significant.

AB  - Background: Electronic platform surveys are ideal for self-administration in adolescent populations, as nearly all adolescents in the US report using or having access to smartphones. This technology-savvy population seems prepared to graduate away from paper surveys. Despite predicted advantages of using smartphones for data collection, there is a surprising lack of data regarding the use of this mode for surveillance of substance use trends among adolescent populations. Objectives: The objective of this study was to evaluate completion rates, times, and responses of high school students taking the Secondary Student Life Survey: Nevada (SSLS:NV) on their own personal smartphones compared to provided computers or tablets. Methods: The SSLS:NV is a web-based survey designed to assess adolescent beliefs, attitudes, and use-trends surrounding substance use. The SSLS:NV was self-administered via self-selected device (personal vs. provided) within one class period to approximately one thousand 9th-12th grade students in December 2016. Data was collected and analyzed to compare outcomes by computer, tablet, or smartphone. Statistical analysis was performed in SPSS 23.0 using chi(2) or Fisher's exact test for categorical data and one-way ANOVA for continuous data. Results: SSLS:NV completion times averaged 21 min overall (p = .193). Differences were seen with completion rates of 86% smartphone 94% tablet, and 95% computer (p < .001), while responses to lifetime substance use were similar across all groups. Conclusions/Importance: The current study provides proof of concept that personal smartphones are effective in achieving more comprehensive adolescent substance use surveillance within a relatively short amount of time, while retaining robust response rates.

AB  - Purpose In the limited existing research on smartphone addiction, reinforcement reward and automatic habit have been identified as two distinct underlying mechanisms. The purpose of this paper is to better understand the interaction between these two mechanisms, as well as role of smartphone features in activating different formation mechanisms. Design/methodology/approach An online survey with 379 samples was conducted to empirically validate the model. The data were analyzed by structural equation modeling approach. Findings The automatic habit strengthens the driving effects of reinforcement rewards (i.e. perceived enjoyment and mood regulation) on smartphone addiction. Smartphone features activate distinct underlying mechanisms. Value-added function facilitates the perception of reinforcement rewards, while convenience promotes the habit formation. Originality/value This study is one of the first ones that assess the interplay between the two formation mechanisms in the extant literature on smartphone addiction. This study also reveals the dangers of smartphone features which have always been regarded as advantages. The findings contribute to the current understandings of smartphone addiction.

AB  - With the adoption and popularization of internet-based platforms, sports betting has introduced new functionalities that transform the design of its products and therefore the way bettors interact with them. This study aims to explore the association between the use of new structural characteristics of online betting and gambling severity. Five characteristics are examined here: (i) live in-play betting; (ii) cash out feature use (as example of in-play betting in-built features); (iii) fantasy sports gaming; (iv) location of betting; and (v) device or platform used to make bets. A cohort (N=659) of Spanish gamblers who had bet on sports during the previous year was recruited through an online survey. The results suggested that those bettors scoring higher on gambling problems also utilized more often such new structural characteristics, in a proportion not explained only by their higher overall gambling activity. Mobile betting was especially frequent among problem gamblers.

AB  - More and more respondents are answering web surveys using mobile devices. Mobile respondents tend to provide shorter responses to open questions than PC respondents. Using voice recording to answer open-ended questions could increase data quality and help engage groups usually underrepresented in web surveys. Revilla, Couper, Bosch, and Asensio showed that in particular the use of voice recording still presents many challenges, even if it could be a promising tool. This article reports results from a follow-up experiment in which the main goals were to (1) test whether different instructions on how to use the voice recording tool reduce technical and understanding problems, and thereby reduce item nonresponse while preserving data quality and the evaluation of the tool; (2) test whether nonresponse due to context can be reduced by using a filter question, and how this affects data quality and the tool evaluation; and (3) understand which factors affect nonresponse to open-ended questions using voice recording, and if these factors also affect data quality and the evaluation of the tool. The experiment was implemented within a smartphone web survey in Spain focused on Android devices. The results suggest that different instructions did not affect nonresponse to the open questions and had little effect on data quality for those who did answer. Introducing a filter to ensure that people were in a setting that permits voice recording seems useful. Despite efforts to reduce problems, a substantial proportion of respondents are still unwilling or unable to answer open questions using voice recording.

AB  - Parents are the main mediators of the digital exposure and experiences of young children. When adopting a parental mediation style, they are challenged by a dilemma: protecting their children often means invading their privacy and restricting their options. The adopted parental mediation style is pondered according to the perceptions and experiences of parents regarding digital media; it is an ongoing and dynamic negotiation between the actions of parents and children. Our research focuses on mobile apps, since the favourite devices of young children are smartphones and tablets, in order to explore how parents and children select apps, and which criteria they use. Our fieldwork was conducted in Portugal and used a mixed method, combining an online survey to a purposive sample of 1955 parents of children under 8 years old, and separate interviews to parents and children under 8 to a purposive sample of 81 families. Our results reveal how parents are coping with contrasting perceptions on digital media and how they negotiate their parental mediation style in interaction with their children. Parents believe more in building trust than in restricting children, but when they find it necessary, their will to protect overcomes their respect for the children's privacy.

AB  - With many ways for consumers to access and consume music, little is known about why people choose to listen to music via one format over another. Using a uses and gratifications approach, the present research used an online questionnaire (N = 396) to examine people's format use, concerning six particular formats. The results suggest that eight dimensions, namely, usability and intention to use, discovery, functional utility, flexibility, connection, social norms, value for money, and playback diversity, define the uses and gratifications that particular formats serve. When considering whether format use was related to broader music engagement behaviors, results indicated different associations between music engagement variables and format use suggesting that different formats allow listeners to engage with music in unique ways. Findings have implications for future research that examines how and why people engage with music listening in everyday life, elaborating further our understanding of how selection of particular formats can lead to different listening experiences.

AB  - Objective Little attention has been paid to understanding how engaging in cancer-related interpersonal exchanges via varying modes of communication influences psychological well-being among young adults with cancer. This study explored the moderating role of communication mode on the relationship of relational processes of disclosure and responsiveness with psychological well-being. Methods 61 young adults with cancer (M-age = 34.59, SD = 4.82) completed a questionnaire about their most recent cancer-related conversation. Participants reported on communication mode (ie, face-to-face, text message, and phone call) and relational processes of self- and support member- disclosure of thoughts, information, and feelings and how accepted, cared for, and understood they felt within the cancer-related conversation. Cancer adjustment measures included functional well-being and depressive symptoms. Results There were no main effects of communication mode or relational processes. However, communication mode did moderate the relationship between relational processes and cancer adjustment. Greater relational processes of disclosure and responsiveness were associated with better functional well-being and lower depressive symptoms only among those who engaged in their most recent cancer-related conversation through technology-related communication and not for those engaged in face-to-face communication. Conclusion Relational processes that are likely to benefit psychological adjustment after cancer appear to be particularly advantageous over technology-based communication. Young adults commonly report feelings of social isolation and psychological distress after cancer. These findings suggest that technology-related communication holds promise as a way to strengthen support-related communication and protect against distress.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the effects that reading on screens (using digital devices with different screen sizes) and on paper have on reading time and comprehension. The study group was comprised of126 secondary students from a private school. To ensure balance, the participants were assigned into test groups, formed according to the size of the reading device, based on class levels, gender, and average school grade. In the data collection process, a narrative text was transferred to both print and electronic media. Access to the text was provided on paper and three digital devices. There were no time limitations. After reading, participants were given comprehension tests that consisted of twenty multiple-choice questions. Female participants' on-screen comprehension scores were found to be relatively higher compared to their paper comprehension scores. They also acquired better scores as the screen size increased. Conversely, male participants had higher comprehension scores on tablets and smart phones. Participants who read the text on smart phones and tablets completed the tasks in less time compared to other groups. However, the effects of reading modality on comprehension and reading time were not found to be statistically significant in either the male or female groups.

AB  - A web-based survey was conducted of ergonomics practitioners holding certifications in the U.S., Canada, Great Britain, Australia, and New Zealand. The survey follows 12 years after an earlier initial survey reported by Dempsey et al. (2005). Approximately 1221 eligible participants were invited by e-mail to participate, and 405 surveys were included in the final analysis. The survey queried use of basic instruments relevant to ergonomic practice as well as more specific analytical tools such as observational techniques for assessing postural demands of work and instrumentation for direct measurement of such demands. Some ergonomic assessment methods appear to have increased in their overall use by U.S. ergonomists compared to 2005 data. This was observed for: RULA, REBA, Psychophysical Upper Extremity Data, Strain Index, and ACGIH TLV for Hand Activity Level. There is minimal evidence of increased overall use of direct measurement approaches in the U.S. There appear to be geographic differences between countries/continents in terms of use of various methods. The use of mobile device/smart phone "apps" by ergonomists was queried and these technologies presently appear to be in early adoption phase with 24-28% of practitioners reporting use of an app in their ergonomics practice.

AB  - Stated preference (SP) web surveys are increasingly completed on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets instead of computers. Due to differences in technical attributes and response contexts of the devices, this trend may affect the quality of the survey data and elicited welfare measures. Little is known of such device effects in SP research. In the first such study of its kind, we compare willingness to pay (WTP) and response quality between devices in a large, national contingent valuation survey. Propensity score matching is used to distinguish device effects from observed sample composition effects due to self-selection. We find significantly higher WTP for smartphone respondents in the first out of four sequential WTP questions, and no differences for tablets. Concerning data (response) quality, results are mixed, but not consistently lower for smartphones and tablets compared to computers. Measured by indicators of response randomness, shares of don't know and protest zeros, smartphone responses even show signs of higher quality. Only in terms of the extent of internal scope sensitivity, do smartphones and tablets fare somewhat worse than computers. Overall, our results do not indicate substantial loss of response quality or differences in welfare measures for mobile devices.

AB  - This paper aims to contribute to the growing literature on the potential benefits of the Internet on rural livelihoods. We estimate the relationship between Internet access and agricultural production in rural Viet Nam using a panel dataset from 2008-2012. This is a time span during which Internet access increased substantially and government-run and private online outlets providing information about agriculture started to operate. Our findings suggest that Internet access is associated with a 6.8% higher volume of total agricultural output. We find that this result is manifested through more efficient use of fertilizer. Our findings are stronger for younger households. The less developed northern provinces have benefited the most from the arrival of the Internet. The results are weaker in the case of rice, which is related to strong government involvement in rice production and prices.

AB  - Smartphones are ubiquitous and frequently used in copresent interactions. This behavior is often seen as inappropriate and thus has been termed phubbing, compromising the words "phone" and "snubbing." Although being a worldwide phenomenon, little is known about what predicts phubbing behavior in the first place. Drawing on injunctive norms (i.e., what ought to be done), the study's aim was to shed light on the relationship between mobile phone norms (MPN) and phubbing behavior. Furthermore, the role of being permanently online and permanently connected (POPC) and fear of missing out (FOMO), reflecting approach and avoidance orientations, respectively, as additional predictors and moderators was investigated. As expected, the findings of an online survey (N = 278) supported the assumption that MPN were negatively related to phubbing behavior. Moreover, results showed that both FOMO and POPC were significantly positively connected to phubbing behavior but did not play significant moderating roles concerning the norm-phubbing relationship.

AB  - A major concern arising from ubiquitous tracking of individuals' online activity is that algorithms may be trained to predict personal sensitive information, even for users who do not wish to reveal such information. Although previous research has shown that digital trace data can accurately predict sociodemographic characteristics, little is known about the potentials of such data to predict sensitive outcomes. Against this background, we investigate in this article whether we can accurately predict voting behavior, which is considered personal sensitive information in Germany and subject to strict privacy regulations. Using records of web browsing and mobile device usage of about 2,000 online users eligible to vote in the 2017 German federal election combined with survey data from the same individuals, we find that online activities do not predict (self-reported) voting well in this population. These findings add to the debate about users' limited control over (inaccurate) personal information flows.

AB  - This study explores some features of slider bars in the context of a multi-device web survey. Using data collected among the students of the University of Trento in 2015 and 2016 by means of two web surveys (N = 6,343 and 4,124) including two experiments, we investigated the effect of the initial position of the handle and the presence of numeric labels on answers provided using slider bars. It emerged that the initial position of the handle affected answers and that the number of rounded scores increased with numeric feedback. Smartphone respondents appeared more sensitive to the initial position of the handle but also less affected by the presence of numeric labels resulting in a lower tendency to rounding. Yet, outcomes on anchoring were inconclusive. Overall, no relevant differences have been detected between tablet and PC respondents. Understanding to what extent interactive and engaging tools such as slider bars can be successfully employed in multi-device surveys without affecting data quality is a key challenge for those who want to exploit the potential of web-based and multi-device data collection without undermining the quality of measurement.

AB  - Most mobile devices nowadays have a camera. Besides, posting and sharing images have been found as one of the most frequent and engaging Internet activities. However, to our knowledge, no research has explored the feasibility of asking respondents of online surveys to upload images to answer survey questions. The main goal of this article is to investigate the viability of asking respondents of an online opt-in panel to upload during a mobile web survey: First, a photo taken in the moment, and second, an image already saved on their smartphone. In addition, we want to test to what extent the Google Vision application programming interface (API), which can label images into categories, produces similar tags than a human coder. Overall, results from a survey conducted among millennials in Spain and Mexico (N = 1,614) show that more than half of the respondents uploaded an image. Of those, 77.3% and 83.4%, respectively, complied with what the question asked. Moreover, respectively, 52.4% and 65.0% of the images were similarly codified by the Google Vision API and the human coder. In addition, the API codified 1,818 images in less than 5 min, whereas the human coder spent nearly 35 hours to complete the same task.

AB  - Qualitative inquiry always used various kinds of data for understanding social issues and participants' perspectives. Research and methodologies were debated for what data are adequate for studying social justice issues. Current challenges for concepts of data are new, for example, virtual and digital data, question traditional data (interviews, ethnography, etc.) in their relevance for understanding current life worlds. New methods produce new and other forms of data (e.g., mobile, virtual data). Neoliberal contexts produce questions about qualitative research and its data. What is an adequate and contemporary understanding of the concept of "data"? These questions are discussed in this special issue.

AB  - Innovators and entrepreneurs developing products and competing "on top" of digital platforms face different conditions than do those in more traditional industries. In this paper, we explore how this affects appropriability strategies in novel data on mobile app developers' appropriability strategies. We find that the many smallest developers in the "long tail"- the vast majority of all developers - do in fact take actions to capture value and to protect their intellectual property, but do so only through informal mechanisms. By contrast, larger developers exploit a combination of both informal mechanisms and formal intellectual property rights, using copyright, patents, and trademarks. Several strategies particular to digital platforms are also documented. We link this pattern of different strategies pursued by different competitor types to the structural features of digital competition.

AB  - Despite rapid digital development in the past two decades, the remote parts of Australia still experience disadvantages with the adoption and diffusion of digital technology. As the adoption of information and communication technology continues to increase at a significant rate, investigating the underlying factors of the digital divide in general and also in the context of social exclusion in Australia is pertinent. The current study fills the gap in the existing body of knowledge by exploring the effect of socio-demographic factors and remoteness on the digital divide landscape with a country-specific focus on Australia. Using state-wide longitudinal data covering the 1998-2015 period within the panel data estimation framework, this study finds that digital divide is significantly associated with socio-demographic factors and remoteness in Australia. Moreover, the findings affirm that in addition to telecommunication infrastructure development, policymakers should also underscore socio-demographic factors in shaping digital inclusion strategies.

AB  - Digital technologies have redefined how people use audio media, especially for the millennial audience segment. Faced with the challenge from streaming music, many broadcast radio stations have launched their own mobile apps to compete with the new audio services such as Spotify. Guided by the uses and gratifications conceptual framework, this study employed a national survey to investigate millennials' perceptions of the substitutability and complementarity of broadcast radio, its apps, and music streaming services. The results showed that while radio listeners perceived broadcast radio and its apps as similar products, they regarded music streaming services as distinct from the two. In addition, this study examined motivators behind the diverse perceptions and identified information, escapism, entertainment, and socialization as important. The results suggest that radio stations should take advantage of the mobile technology and offer unique values through their apps, rather than duplicate the offline consumption experience.

AB  - This research explores the design, implementation, and evaluation of a prototype augmented reality application that assists operators in performing procedural tasks in control room settings. Our prototype uses a tablet display to supplement an operator's natural view of existing control panel elements with sequences of interactive visual and attention guiding cues. An experiment, conducted using a nuclear power plant simulator, examined university students completing both standard and emergency operating procedures. The augmented reality condition was compared against two other conditions - a paper-based procedure condition using paper manuals and a computer-based procedure condition using digital procedures presented on a desktop display. The results demonstrated that the augmented reality -based procedure system had benefits in terms of reduced mental workload in comparison to the other two conditions. Regarding task completion time, accuracy, and situation awareness, the augmented reality condition had no significant difference when compared against the computer-based procedure condition but performed better than the paper-based procedure condition. It was also found that the augmented reality condition resulted in fewer intra-team inquiry communication exchanges in comparison to both paper-based and computer-based conditions. The augmented reality condition, however, yielded poorer memory retention score when assessed against the other two conditions.

Since the type of device used to access marketing channels influences conversions, this research examines the different impacts of different devices such as desktop computers, tablets, and smartphones on the success of various marketing channels. We find customer experience (CX) to be important in improving attribution outcomes (e.g., conversion rates) by combining clickstream and survey data to understand consumers' decision processes. Therefore, this paper also conceptualizes and measures perceptions of CX of clickstream-data participants. We identify the central implications of using each device.

AB  - Smartphones, with their ubiquitous presence, have become indispensable devices. Considerable research has been conducted on the pros and cons of mobile availability, but comparatively less research exists on different forms of mobile unavailability. Using an online factorial survey on 146 German smartphone users, the situational, usage-related, and personality-related factors influencing the perception of 72 systematically constructed fictitious scenarios of mobile unavailability were studied. Using a multilevel approach, the research revealed that the place, reason and duration of unavailability, and expectation of contact attempts influence situational mobile unavailability. Individual factors such as the significance of mobile availability, the availability expectations of friends, a disposition for FOMO (fear of missing out), and a high level of conscientiousness influence the perception of the unavailability scenarios. Furthermore, three cross-level effects between situational and individual factors are found.

AB  - First step of the development of an effective safety management system is to create reliable crash databases since the quality of decision making in road safety depends on the quality of the data on which decisions are based. Improving crash data is a worldwide priority, as highlighted in the Global Plan for the Decade of Action for Road Safety adopted by the United Nations, which recognizes that the overall goal of the plan will be attained improving the quality of data collection at the national, regional and global levels.
   Crash databases provide the basic information for effective highway safety efforts at any level of government, but lack of uniformity among countries and among the different jurisdictions in the same country is observed. Several existing databases show significant drawbacks which hinder their effective use for safety analysis and improvement. Furthermore, modern technologies offer great potential for significant improvements of existing methods and procedures for crash data collection, processing and analysis. To address these issues, in this paper we present the development and evaluation of a web-based platform independent software for crash data collection, processing and analysis. The software is designed for mobile and desktop electronic devices and enables a guided and automated drafting of the crash report, assisting police officers both on-site and in the office.
   The software development was based both on the detailed critical review of existing Australasian, EU, and U.S. crash databases and software as well as on the continuous consultation with the stakeholders. The evaluation was carried out comparing the completeness, timeliness, and accuracy of crash data before and after the use of the software in the city of Vico Equense, in south of Italy showing significant advantages. The amount of collected information increased from 82 variables to 268 variables, i.e., a 227% increase. The time saving was more than one hour per crash, i.e., a 36% reduction. The on-site data collection did not produce time saving, however this is a temporary weakness that will be annihilated very soon in the future after officers are more acquainted with the software. The phase of evaluation, processing and analysis carried out in the office was dramatically shortened, i.e., a 69% reduction. Another benefit was the standardization which allowed fast and consistent data analysis and evaluation. Even if all these benefits are remarkable, the most valuable benefit of the new procedure was the reduction of the police officers mistakes during the manual operations of survey and data evaluation. Because of these benefits, the satisfaction questionnaires administrated to the police officers after the testing phase showed very good acceptance of the procedure. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Though tourists can search for necessary information on the internet while sightseeing, it takes effort and is inconvenient to obtain available information related to specific sightseeing spots among the copious amount of information online. Targeting urban tourist areas in Japan, the present study aims to develop a system that can provide guidance and information concerning sightseeing spots by integrating location-based augmented reality (AR) and object-recognition AR and by using pictograms. The system enables users to efficiently obtain the directions to sightseeing spots and nearby facilities within urban tourist areas and sightseeing spot information. Additionally, the city of Chofu in the metropolis of Tokyo was selected as the operation target area. The operation of the system was conducted for 1 month, targeting those inside and outside the operation target area, and a web questionnaire survey was conducted with a total number of 50 users. From the evaluation results of the web questionnaire survey, the usefulness of the original functions of integrating location-based AR and object-recognition AR and by using pictograms, as well as of the entire system, was analyzed. From the results of the access analysis of users' log data, it is expected that users will further utilize each function. Additionally, it is evident that location-based AR was used more often than was object-recognition AR.

AB  - This article analyses how changing life situations affect media use, conceptualized as a question of how biographical disruption could destabilize media repertoires and public connection. To answer this question, the analysis draws on qualitative data from a comprehensive study of media use in Norway, with in-depth interviews and media diaries. The theoretical approach joins domestication and media repertoire theory with research on public connection, considering the ubiquity of digital media in contemporary society. Findings indicate that smartphone use is key to people's reorientations in periods of change, and that intimate and emotional responses to mobile media warrant closer attention. The article contributes to debates on the transformation of media repertoires, a question of growing concern within research on cross-media use, and to long-standing interests in the role of media in everyday life and as central to public connection.

AB  - Background: There are reports of prescription stimulants being purchased online for use as cognitive enhancers or "smart drugs." Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate availability of modafinil and methylphenidate from internet suppliers from the perspective of a typical United Kingdom (UK) based customer. Methods: Using European Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) internet snapshot methodology, we undertook an English language internet snapshot survey in July-August 2018 to gather information on the availability and price of modafinil and methylphenidate from online retailers. Results: A total of 55 modafinil and 14 methylphenidate websites were identified from which the drug could be purchased without a prescription. Minimum purchase quantities ranged from 10 to 90 tablets for modafinil and 1-1,005 tablets for methylphenidate with no apparent upper limit to the number that could be purchased. The price per tablet varied from 0.38-5.31 pound for modafinil and 0.16-5.70 pound for methylphenidate. Free shipping was offered if more than a certain amount was spent on 46 (83.6%) modafinil and 7 (50.0%) methylphenidate websites and discounts were offered on 43 (78.2%) modafinil and 4 (28.6%) methylphenidate websites. Conclusions: Modafinil and methylphenidate are widely available to purchase via internet from the UK without a prescription. The pricing on websites encourages users to buy greater quantities to qualify for discounts and free shipping. The quantities available suggest these purchases may be used in greater amounts than would be legitimately prescribed, increasing the risk of misuse or diversion to other individuals.

A deep and comprehensive understanding of the IFs and their impact on QoE for a given service is an essential precondition for successful QoE management with the overall goal of prominently optimizing end-user QoE, while making efficient use of network resources and maintaining a satisfied user base. The proposed conceptual model was used to conduct a qualitative meta-analytical review of selected papers. The results of the qualitative review include various IFs, QoE dimensions, and key findings in the form of research recommendations for QoE in the context of UC.

AB  - Against the backdrop of alleged mobile phone ubiquity and the enthusiasm about the developmental value of mobile technology, this paper examines the manifestations, drivers, and frictions of mobile phone use in two low- and middle-income settings where mobile technology has diffused rapidly. Qualitative data from 231 participants and survey data from 800 adults in rural Rajasthan and Gansu provide consistent and strong support for the claim that the notion of 'ubiquity' can mislead development practice because it obscures persistent non-use, under-utilisation, and heterogeneous engagement with mobile technology despite its apparently wide accessibility in rural field sites. The paper suggests avenues for further work on the indicators of technology adoption, and it cautions that phone-based development interventions (and their benefits) may diffuse unevenly if the assumption of ubiquitous technology use is violated.

AB  - This article assesses the rationale for India's November 2016 demonetization, in terms of its origins and impact over the following year. I argue that this intervention was conceived and understood as part of a larger international monetary experiment. The article draws upon international media commentary, impact assessments by Indian scholars and the professed goals of the Government of India. Having established a direct link between demonetization and an advancing 'cashless agenda' around the world, I situate Narendra Modi's Digital India programme as the putative foundation for a transactional economy. Drawing upon ethnographic studies exploring the everyday experience of India's year of living digitally, this article raises the critical question of who must, or indeed can, bear the transaction costs of this digital utopia. In conclusion, I argue that the rapid expansion of digital money situates these concerns at the heart of social and cultural, as much as economic, analysis.

AB  - A key question for retailers who already offer a mobile website is, whether they should add an app as an additional purchase channel. We address this issue by exploring whether consumers' app adoption stimulates additional purchases and how this change in purchase behavior differs across customers with different levels of spending share for different product categories and customer loyalty. By using transactional data from a Chinese online retailer, we show that app adopters have higher purchase incidence, buy more frequently, and spend more in each order than non adopters. We also find that app adoption has a stronger positive effect on the order size of customers who have a lower spending share of high-price products and customers who are less loyal to the focal retailer. Hereby, we contribute to multichannel and mobile marketing literature by empirically examining the effects of adding a similar (mobile) purchase channel to an already established (mobile) purchase channel. Managerially, our results suggest that apps are worth investing in despite their similarity to mobile websites and can induce non-loyal customers to purchase more and thus potentially foster these customers' loyalty.

AB  - In the current paper, we describe an integrated online- and mobile-based application for the treatment of childhood anxiety disorders, Anxiety Coach. The technology is designed to increase the use of exposure therapy by therapists and patients. We begin by outlining the clinical content and design of the application, and then review the clinical administration and theoretical basis for the program. Next, using results from an implementation feasibility study, we illustrate how data collected during application use can inform therapists, supervisors, and researchers about process variables (i.e., use of exposure) and outcomes (i.e., symptom improvement). Implications of the potential for Anxiety Coach to increase access to evidence-based treatment and directions for further research are discussed.

AB  - This study tested the hypothesis as to whether the mode and time of information technology use-such as using various electronic and computing devices for gambling and collecting information related to gambling-can positively predict disordered gambling, with the effects of Internet gaming addiction and illusory control being taken into account. A questionnaire set was administered to 677 Hong Kong secondary school students to assess their maladaptive gambling behavior, Internet gaming addiction, illusory control, and the habit of information technology use, such as the amount of time spent on watching television, browsing the Internet, and playing online gambling and non-gambling games. The results suggest that utilizing computing and electronic devices for gambling-related activities is positively indicative of disordered gambling, making use of information technology for work or study being a buffering factor. Utilizing information technology for non-gambling activities-such as the durations of playing non-gambling games and making non-gambling purchases online-is not related to disordered gambling, albeit their positive correlations with Internet gaming addiction. Likewise, Internet gaming addiction has no association with using information technology devices for any gambling-related activities, except its very small correlation with playing online gambling games. In addition, tablet computers may provide a convenient means for gambling activities and tend to be used by problem gamblers. It is recommended that intervention strategies targeted at secondary school students should address not only the amount of use but also the way they use information technology devices.

AB  - Previous studies have documented that psychological distress is related to problematic mobile phone use (PMPU), and sporadic research has investigated the potential mechanisms underlying the association. Based on the cognitive-behavioral model of pathological Internet use (PIU), the self-control theory, and the problem-behavior theory, this study aimed to examine the mediating role of maladaptive cognitions toward mobile phones and the moderating role of effortful control between psychological distress and PMPU. Data were collected from 1,799 secondary school students (45.1% male; M-age = 14.07, SD = 1.69) using four self-reported questionnaires. The results revealed that maladaptive cognitions toward mobile phones partially mediated the relationship between psychological distress and PMPU. In addition, effortful control as a protective factor attenuated the indirect effect from psychological distress to PMPU. These findings advanced the understanding of the etiology of PMPU and the need to develop effective strategies for prevention, suggesting that schools and families should pay additional attention to students with psychological distress. Targeted interventions for integrating online and offline worlds and effortful control training programs may help to prevent adolescents from engaging in PMPU.

AB  - Objective We aimed to replicate the concurrent validity of a comprehensive definition of eating disorder recovery (physical, behavioral, and cognitive indices) in a sample followed up 7-8 years from baseline, and to examine, for the first time with this comprehensive definition, predictive validity. Method Participants were 66 women with a history of an eating disorder and 31 age-matched controls who completed an online survey and phone interview. Results In general, women who were fully recovered were statistically indistinguishable from controls and had significantly less eating disorder attitudes and behaviors than the partially recovered and eating disorder groups. Being fully recovered at baseline was a robust predictor of stability: of those fully recovered at baseline, 80% remained fully recovered at follow-up. One-third of those with an eating disorder and one-half of those in partial recovery at baseline attained full recovery at follow-up. Discussion These findings support the current operationalization of eating disorder recovery, encompassing physical, behavioral, and cognitive indices, as valid and highlight that full recovery is not only possible but predicts full recovery years later. Future research should examine this operationalization in diverse samples and study trajectories of recovery to identify predictors.

The purpose of this paper is to adopt media richness and social presence theories as theoretical foundations to address this insufficiency. Design/methodology/approach Collecting 247 responses from an online survey, the authors use structural equation modelling for data analysis and hypothesis testing. Findings The authors found that immediate feedback and personal focus are the main aspects of media richness that are positively related to social presence, relatedness need satisfaction and user loyalty to MIM. Originality/value This is the first study using two pertinent theories to explain how aspects of media richness affect user loyalty to MIM. The present findings suggest that firms developing MIM apps focus on immediate feedback and personal focus as effective means to encourage user loyalty.

AB  - Participation in web surveys via smartphones increased continuously in recent years. The reasons for this increase are a growing proportion of smartphone owners and an increase in mobile Internet access. However, research has shown that smartphone respondents are frequently distracted and/or multitasking, which might affect completion and response behavior in a negative way. We propose 'SurveyMotion (SMotion)', a JavaScript-based tool for mobile devices that can gather information about respondents' motions during web survey completion by using sensor data. Specifically, we collect data about the total acceleration (TA) of smartphones. We conducted a lab experiment and varied the form of survey completion (e.g. standing or walking). Furthermore, we employed questions with different response formats (e.g. radio buttons and sliders) and measured response times. The results reveal that SMotion detects higher TAs of smartphones for respondents with comparatively higher motion levels. In addition, respondents' motion level affects response times and the quality of responses given. The SMotion tool promotes the exploration of how respondents complete mobile web surveys and could be employed to understand how future mobile web surveys are completed.

AB  - Wearable technology has many industrial applications. Optimal use adherence and outcomes largely depend on employee acceptance of the technology. This study determined factors that predict employee acceptance of wearables. An online survey of 1273 employed adults asked about demographics, job and organizational characteristics, experience with and beliefs about wearables, and willingness to use wearables. Use cases focused on workplace safety elicited the highest acceptance. An employees performance expectancy and their organizational safety climate were common predictors of acceptance across use cases. Positive past experiences coincided with involving employees in choosing the device and adequately informing them about data use. Organizations intending to implement wearable technology should (a) focus its use on improving workplace safety, (b) advance a positive safety climate, (c) ensure sufficient evidence to support employees' beliefs that the wearable will meet its objective, and (d) involve and inform employees in the process of selecting and implementing wearable technology.

AB  - Mobile phone distracted driving has been identified as a significant contributor to road trauma. The use of voluntary smartphone applications (or mobile phone functions) which are designed to prevent certain phone behaviours while driving is an emerging countermeasure for distracted driving. Despite the potential for voluntary smartphone applications to reduce crashes associated with mobile phone distracted driving, there has been limited research assessing how effective these applications are in reducing mobile phone use while driving, and the perceived acceptance of such applications. The overall aim of this study is to investigate factors that influence the use of voluntary smartphone applications to reduce the distraction associated with mobile phone use while driving. A total of 712 drivers from Australia participated in an online questionnaire about their preferences and opinions regarding smartphone applications to prevent mobile phone distracted driving. Statistical analyses including a random-effects logistic regression model were conducted to analyse the impact of the application functions on the participants' willingness to install and activate the application. The willingness of participants to install and activate a mobile phone app was determined by the facility to disable visual-manual tasks and notifications and allow hands-free conversations. The facility to set up automatic responses to inform contacts that they are driving was also important. Females were significantly more likely to install and activate the app. Preferred functions included the blocking of visual-manual interactions such as texting and browsing but allowing applications that support driving such as GPS and Bluetooth. Participants also wanted to retain the ability to use music-playing functions. The ability to give commands to the phone exclusively through audio using a hands-free device or Bluetooth was also favoured. Some age-related differences were evident when examining preferred functions. Overall, findings suggest that the use of app-based technology is a potential intervention opportunity to reduce exposure to high-risk behaviours among motorists and particularly young drivers.

AB  - The aim of the current work was to investigate relations between problematic smartphone use (PSU) severity and intolerance of uncertainty, a transdiagnostic psychopathology construct reflecting individual differences in reacting to uncertain situations and events. In addition, it was tested if use of social and/or non-social smartphone use mediated associations between intolerance of uncertainty and PSU. The effective sample comprised 261 college students. Participants completed a web survey using the Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version (measuring PSU), Social and Process Smartphone Use Scale, and Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale-Short Form. The survey was administered twice, with approximately one month separating two measurement waves. In this paper, the measures of intolerance of uncertainty and social/non-social smartphone use from Time 1 and the PSU score from Time 2 were used. Correlation analyses showed that intolerance of uncertainty and both social and non-social smartphone use are related to Time 2 levels of PSU. In a structural equation model, intolerance of uncertainty was positively associated with non-social smartphone use, but not with social smartphone use. Non-social smartphone use was related to Time 2 PSU severity. Mediation analysis showed that only non-social smartphone use mediated the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and levels of PSU. The study contributes to PSU research by demonstrating that intolerance of uncertainty and PSU are associated, and that non-social smartphone use may drive that relationship. This study emphasizes the need to understand the potential causes for excessive technology use.

AB  - Background This study examined the relationship between substance use motives (i.e., social, conformity, coping and enhancement) and substance use in individuals with mild intellectual disability or borderline intellectual functioning (MID-BIF). Method Data were collected among 163 clients with MID-BIF using interactive questionnaires with visual cues on a tablet with a web application. Results Results show that social motives were positively related to frequency of alcohol use, while conformity, coping and enhancement motives were positively related to severity of alcohol use. Results for drug use show that social motives were positively related to frequency of cannabis and hard drug use and that conformity motives were negatively related to frequency of cannabis use. Coping motives were positively related to severity of drug use. Conclusions Insight in substance use motives should be used when adapting interventions, as it could contribute to the prevention and reduction of substance use disorders in individuals with MID-BIF.

AB  - In recent years, agricultural extension services in developing countries have increasingly introduced modern information and communication technologies (ICT) to deliver advice. But to realize efficiency gains, digital applications may need to address heterogeneous information needs by targeting agricultural advisory contents in a household-specific way. We explore the feasibility of an automated advisory service that collects household data from farmers, for example through the keypads of conventional mobile phones, and uses this data to prioritize agricultural advisory messages accordingly. To reduce attrition, such a system must avoid lengthy inquiry. Therefore, our objective was to identify a viable trade-off between low data requirements and useful household-specific prioritizations of advisory messages. At three sites in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania independently, we collected experimental preference rankings from smallholder farmers for receiving information about different agricultural and livelihood practices. At each site, we identified socio-economic household variables that improved model-based predictions of individual farmers' information preferences. We used the models to predict household-specific rankings of information options based on 2-4 variables, requiring the farmer to answer between 5 and 10 questions through an ICT interface. These predicted rankings could inform household-specific prioritizations of advisory messages in a digital agro-advisory application. Household-specific "top 3" options suggested by the models were better-fit to farmers' preferences than a random selection of 3 options by 48-68%, on average. The analysis shows that relatively limited data inputs from fanners, in a simple format, can be used to increase the client-orientation of ICT-mediated agricultural extension. This suggests that household-specific prioritization of agricultural advisory messages through digital two-way communication is feasible. In future digital agricultural advisory applications, collecting little data from farmers at each interaction may feed into learning algorithms that continuously improve the targeting of advice.

AB  - Purpose Technology has dramatically changed the nature of interorganizational relationships and the ways partners interact with each other. In the new platform business model, platform technology usage seems to work as a governance mechanism to regulate operations and manage platform builder-platform participant relationships. To respond to these changes, this study aims to examine how platform technology usage in platform operations influenced the relationship quality between the platform builder and platform participants by promoting perceptions of three types of justice (procedural, distributive and informational). Design/methodology/approach The authors propose that it is through the perception of three types of justice (procedural, distributive and informational) that platform technology usage exerts its governance effect on the platform relationship. In doing this, the authors seek to answer the following two related research questions in the platform setting: How does platform technology usage drive relationship performance via different types of justice perceptions? Which type of justice affects relationship performance most effectively? Findings The results from a survey of 384 participant firms from two of the largest digital platforms for mobile/PC application in China reveal that platform technology usage leads to better relationship performance through enhanced perceptions of procedural, distributive, and informational justice. The positive impacts of procedural justice and distributive justice on relationship performance are greater than that of informational justice, while the impacts of procedural justice and distributive justice show no significant differences. Originality/value These findings provide novel insights into the role and mechanisms of platform technology usage in platform relationship management.

AB  - Instant messaging is a popular form of text-based communication. However, text-based messaging lacks the ability to communicate nonverbal information such as that conveyed through facial expressions and voice tones, although a multitude of emotions may underlie the text of a conversation between participants. In this paper, we propose an approach that uses typefaces to communicate emotions. We investigated which typefaces are useful for delivering emotions and introduced these typefaces into a mobile chat app. We conducted a survey to demonstrate how changes in the typeface of a message affected the meaning of the message conveyed. Our user study provides an understanding of the actual user experience with the application. The results show that the use of multiple typefaces in a message can affect and intensify the valence received by users and the use of multiple typefaces elicited an active response and brought about a livelier mood during texting.

AB  - Across two studies, we aimed to determine the row and column size in matrix-style questions that best optimizes participant experience and data quality for computer and mobile users. In Study 1 (N = 2,492), respondents completed 20 questions (comprising four short scales) presented in a matrix grid (converted to item-by-item format on mobile phones). We varied the number of rows (5, 10, or 20) and columns (3, 5, or 7) of the matrix on each page. Outcomes included both data quality (straightlining, item skip rate, and internal reliability of scales) and survey experience measures (dropout rate, rating of survey experience, and completion time). Results for row size revealed dropout rate and reported survey difficulty increased as row size increased. For column size, seven columns increased the completion time of the survey, while three columns produced lower scale reliability. There was no interaction between row and column size. The best overall size tested was a 5 x 5 matrix. In Study 2 (N = 2,570), we tested whether the effects of row size replicated when using a single 20-item scale that crossed page breaks and found that participant survey ratings were still best in the five-row condition. These results suggest that having around five rows or potentially fewer per page, and around five columns for answer options, gives the optimal survey experience, with equal or better data quality, when using matrix-style questions in an online survey. These recommendations will help researchers gain the benefits of using matrices in their surveys with the least downsides of the format.

AB  - Tablets are increasingly being used in schools for a variety of handwriting tasks. Given that the control of handwriting relies on both visual and proprioceptive feedback, especially in younger writers, this raises the question of whether the texture of the tablet surface affects graphomotor execution. A series of recent studies found that when the smoothness of a tablet screen modifies proprioceptive feedback, the impact on graphomotor execution varies according to the level of the writer's handwriting skills. However, as the writing on the screen remained visible in these studies, participants may have compensated for the decrease in proprioceptive feedback by relying more heavily on visual information. The aim of the present study was therefore to unravel the respective contributions of different types of sensory feedback during handwriting development and, consequently, the compensatory role of visual information when children and adults have to write on a tablet. To this end, we asked second and fifth graders and adult participants to write letters and pseudowords on a plastic board placed on top of a tablet screen. Participants wrote on either the smooth or the granular side of the plastic board (manipulation of surface friction), and with normal vision or behind a shield that hid the hand and handwriting from direct view (manipulation of vision). Kinematic parameters and legibility were recorded to assess handwriting performances. Results revealed a significant interaction between proprioceptive and visual feedback on letter size, pen speed and legibility, regardless of participants' age. Furthermore, reducing the visual and proprioceptive feedback had a greater effect on the children's handwriting performances than on those of adults. Overall, the present study provides new insight into the contribution of the different types of sensory feedback and their interaction with handwriting development. In addition, our results on the impact of tablet surface on graphomotor execution will serve as useful pointers for improving the design of this tool for children, such as increasing the degree of friction of the screen surface.

AB  - Mobile coverage recently has reached an all-time high, and in most countries, high-speed Internet connections are widely available. Due to technological development, smartphones and tablets have become increasingly popular. Accordingly, we have observed an increasing use of mobile devices to complete web surveys and, hence, survey methodologists have shifted their attention to the challenges that stem from this development. The present study investigated whether the growing use of smartphones has decreased how systematically this choice of device varies between groups of respondents (i.e., how selective smartphone usage for completing web surveys is). We collected a data set of 18,520 respondents from 18 web surveys that were fielded in Germany between 2012 and 2016. Based on these data, we show that while the use of smartphones to complete web surveys has considerably increased over time, selectivity with respect to using this device has remained stable.

AB  - The Autism impact measure (AIM) is a caregiver-reported questionnaire assessing autism symptom frequency and impact in children, previously shown to have good test-retest reliability, convergent validity and structural validity. This study extended previous work by exploring the AIM's ability to discriminate between known-groups' of children, and estimating thresholds for clinically important responses. Data were collected online and electronically on computer and mobile devices; hence, it was also possible to confirm other psychometric properties of the AIM in this format. This study provides confirmatory and additional psychometric validation of the AIM. The AIM offers a valid, quick and inexpensive method for caregivers to report core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) including communication deficits, difficulties with social interactions and repetitive behaviors.

AB  - The study aimed to examine the longitudinal causal relationships of depressive moods, problematic mobile phone use, and negative school outcomes based on the cognitive-behavioral model among Korean adolescents. The changes within each construct over time were also explored. A total of 1,610 valid responses from three-year longitudinal data from the Korean Children and Youth Panel Survey were analysed and multivariate latent growth modeling was used. Depressive moods, problematic mobile phone use, and negative school outcomes at earlier ages each increased in severity across the three years. Initial levels of depressive moods increased initial levels of problematic mobile phone use and negative school outcomes, including changed rates of negative school outcomes. Additionally, changed rates of depressive moods positively predicted changed rates of problematic mobile phone use and negative school outcomes. Lastly, initial levels and changed rates of problematic mobile phone use predicted initial levels and changed rates of negative school outcomes respectively. Implications of the findings in the context of adolescents' psychological problems and problematic mobile phone use are discussed.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of implementing an online instant response system "Kahoot!" in an Earth Science class in a rural area of Taiwan. The study adopted the mixed-methods approach, based primarily on a quasi-experimental approach, to investigate the effects. The participants were randomly grouped into two classes, with Kahoot! as the intervention. The seventh-grade junior high school students were instructed by the same teacher. The research questions were whether the mobile technology impacted students' learning motivation and achievement and how the learning processes proceeded. Data were collected through surveys, student assignments, exams, learning journals, and interviews. The results indicated that the implementation of "Kahoot!" can enhance these rural-area students' learning motivation, gain the rural-area students' attention, and create incentives for the students to preview and review learning materials promoting learning efficiency. Moreover, the integration enhanced learning achievement. On the other hand, the teachable moments Kahoot! created may not be sustainable. It is hoped that the research findings can provide teachers with implications and guidelines to successfully integrate mobile technologies to enhance learning in their classrooms.

AB  - Positive face-to-face human interactions are known to benefit well-being. Drawing upon previous work regarding the interference of media (via technological devices or print) in social interaction, the aim of this study was to identify whether using media during face-to-face interaction could potentially limit the positive effect of interaction on well-being. Participants were 437 university students who completed an online survey which assessed media multitasking behaviors, well-being (trait depression, trait anxiety, social anxiety, empathy, and psychological well-being), and personality traits (Big-5 and narcissism). Face-to-face interaction was positively associated with well-being. However, when media use during face-to-face interaction was considered, there was a negative relationship with well-being (more depression, more anxiety, and less psychological well-being). Those who used certain media types, such as phone or video chatting, listening to music, and gaming, while interacting with others, also had lower scores on measures of empathy. Regression analyses showed significant contributions by these media types to empathy levels, even after controlling for age, gender, and personality traits. Face-to-face media multitasking was related to higher levels of narcissism and neuroticism, and lower levels of agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness. This study provides insight into the possible role of media multitasking during face-to-face interaction on psychosocial outcomes.

AB  - The present study aims to deepen the relationship between people's loneliness and relational motivations toward people-nearby applications (PNAs) use, within the uses and gratification framework. Indeed, due to the spread of indifference and mistrust toward other citizens, local communities and the relationships within them can leave some individuals' social needs unsatisfied. An online questionnaire, including the Social and Emotional Loneliness Scale for Adults-short version and the Cyber Relationships Motives Scale, was administered to 647 PNAs users (age: M = 26.76; standard deviation = 8.77); hierarchical regressions were performed. Individuals' loneliness associated significantly with the search for love and the desire to meet new people when perceiving offline constraints, but not with the simple desire to meet new people. These results support the idea that PNAs could represent a mean to integrate the aggregation functions of local communities, allowing to find new people to meet nearby regardless of the constraints actually perceived. Being social relationships critical for individuals' well-being, understanding the unsatisfied individual needs underlying PNAs social uses and how these apps could be used within local communities could help in integrating people within their local communities and neighbourhoods again, fostering their well-being too.

AB  - Cannabis and tobacco/nicotine use are highly comorbid. Given expanding access to cannabis through legalization for recreational use, it is important to understand how patterns of cannabis and tobacco/ nicotine co-use are associated with young adult outcomes. A predominantly California-based sample of 2,429 young adults (mean age = 20.7) completed an online survey. Based on past-year reports of cannabis and tobacco/nicotine use, we defined 5 mutually exclusive groups: (a) single-product use; (b) concurrent use only (using both products, but only on separate occasions); (c) sequential use only (using both products on the same occasion, one right after the other, but not mixing them together); (d) coadministration only (using both products on the same occasion by mixing them in the same delivery device); and (e) both sequential use and coadministration. We examined group differences in use patterns, dependence, consequences of use, and psychosocial functioning. Fifty percent of respondents reported cannabis use, 43% tobacco/nicotine use, and 37% co-use of both substances. The most prevalent method of co-use involved smoking combustible products. Overall, individuals who co-used both substances on the same occasion in some way reported heavier use and greater problematic behaviors than those who did not. Sequential use (especially among those that also engaged in coadministration) was typically associated with worse physical and mental functioning overall compared to using each substance separately. Findings illuminate both prevalence and risks associated with co-use of cannabis and tobacco/nicotine products and can inform policies for states considering regulation of cannabis and tobacco/nicotine products.

AB  - Technology can help support the goal of many older adults to live independently, though cognitive, attitudinal, and other barriers often result in a "digital divide" in which older adults use and adopt new technology at a lower rate compared to younger adults. Due to the many potential benefits of technology it is not surprising that interest in tools that assess technology proficiency among older adults has increased. These tools can help support older adult technology research and training. However, to understand these issues more broadly, especially cross-cultural determinants of technology proficiency, translated, validated, and standardized measures of proficiency are necessary. For example, according to the last Eurobarometer (European Commission, 2015), Spain has experienced the largest increase in technology adoption among European Union nations in the past few years, indicating potential cultural mediation of technology adoption and use. To benefit the investigation of cross-cultural differences and their causes, we adapted the Mobile Device Proficiency Questionnaire (MDPQ) and Computer Proficiency Questionnaire (CPQ) for older adults in Spain, including the full and brief forms of each measure. Consistent with English versions of the questionnaires, the scales and their subscales were found to be reliable and valid measures of mobile device and computer proficiency in Spanish older adults. However, in contrast to earlier studies, the factor structure for both questionnaires simplified into two factors for the population under study. We conclude that the Spanish versions of the MDPQ and CPQ can be employed as useful tools for measuring mobile device and computer proficiency in the Spanish older adult population for research and training purposes.

AB  - The experience sampling method (ESM) is a structured diary method with high ecological validity, in that it accurately captures the everyday context of individuals through repeated measurements in naturalistic environments. Our main objective was to investigate the feasibility of using ESM in individuals with acquired brain injury (ABI). A second goal was to explore the usability of ESM data on a clinical level, by illustrating the interactions between person, environment, and affect. The PsyMate device provided ABI patients (N = 17) with ten signals (beeps) per day during six consecutive days. Each beep was followed by a digital questionnaire assessing mood, location, activities, social context, and physical well-being. Results demonstrated high feasibility with a 71% response rate and a 99% completion rate of the questionnaires. There were no dropouts and the method was experienced as user-friendly. Time-lagged multilevel analysis showed that higher levels of physical activity and fatigue predicted higher levels of negative affect at the same point in time, but not at later time points. This study illustrates the potential of ESM to identify complex person-environment dynamics after ABI, while generating understandable and easy to use graphical feedback.

AB  - This article explores the comparability of assessment tools under different format conditions. Prior studies have not considered the interaction of format and device on time to complete an assessment and have instead treated each of them separately with conflicting results. This study assesses, by linear regressions using web-based data, the performance of multiple devices under varying formats while controlling for non-device factors such as demographic information. The results of this study add to the growing literature on the equivalence among devices and formats used to collect and interpret performance in a variety of organizational settings.

AB  - Web surveys are struggling to attract and retain respondents due to high burden and competition for the users(') attention. One possible solution to this issue is the improvement of the visual design of surveys. In this article, we evaluate the impact of visual aids such as smiley faces, stars, hearts, and thumbs as alternatives to traditional radio buttons. We use an experimental design in a nonprobability online survey to investigate how the new designs compare with radio buttons and how the results might interact with device used for completion (PC vs mobile), the use of labels, the type of response scale (bipolar vs unipolar), and the number of response categories (5 vs 7 point). While we do not find big differences in response, quality and experience, there seem to be some indication that the use of smiley faces leads to worse data quality.

AB  - In the era of perpetual digital connectedness, information and communication technology has significantly altered the way people communicate and interact with each other. Nonetheless, the computer-mediated communication should only complement offline communication rather than substituting it, as the resultant online ties are not as strong as face-to-face ties. In an effort to understand the motives in making offline social interactions real and ultimately to predict willingness to engage in serendipitous interactions with people encountered in a public place, we propose a place-aware social matching model driven by interpersonal factors (i.e., similarity, complementarity, and intimacy) and socio-spatial factors (i.e., place sociability, information acquisition expectancy, and perceived personal space in a place). Through a web-based social matching survey experiment (N = 1139 matches from 99 participants in Korea) based on a bogus stranger paradigm, we examine the interrelationship between those factors and the interaction willingness using a series of multiple regression analyses and build a prediction model by devising predictive features based on several machine learning models. From this, we find that both factors have statistically significant influence on interaction willingness, yet interpersonal factors have a higher relative importance than the socio-spatial factors. The interesting point is that the predictive power of these factors varies according to the place characteristics and the level of interaction willingness. We also empirically test the predictability of the model built from the controlled lab experiment through real-world experiments. The results reveal that the proposed model predicts interaction willingness in a real world with under 21% error rate within the Korean cultural context. Findings have implications for the design of mobile social networking systems that endeavor to facilitate serendipitous interactions.

AB  - The notion that digital-screen engagement decreases adolescent well-being has become a recurring feature in public, political, and scientific conversation. The current level of psychological evidence, however, is far removed from the certainty voiced by many commentators. There is little clear-cut evidence that screen time decreases adolescent well-being, and most psychological results are based on single-country, exploratory studies that rely on inaccurate but popular self-report measures of digital-screen engagement. In this study, which encompassed three nationally representative large-scale data sets from Ireland, the United States, and the United Kingdom (N = 17,247 after data exclusions) and included time-use-diary measures of digital-screen engagement, we used both exploratory and confirmatory study designs to introduce methodological and analytical improvements to a growing psychological research area. We found little evidence for substantial negative associations between digital-screen engagement-measured throughout the day or particularly before bedtime-and adolescent well-being.

AB  - Android 5 informs users of all permissions requested when downloading an app and gives users an all-or-nothing acceptance decision to make for the permissions. In contrast, Android 6 informs users of each permission upon first use of the downloaded app. We conducted an online study with participants recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk to compare the relative usability of the two permissions interfaces. Each interface condition contained a simulation of the Google Play Store and instructed participants to role-play the task of downloading an app. Afterward, each participant was questioned about which permissions were seen and the functions of those permissions. The Android 5 interface showed better performance with informing users as to which permissions access their device, whereas the Android 6 interface fared better with presenting the functions of the permissions. Also, the Android 6 interface was found to be more intuitive to use than that of Android 5. Although a pilot study showed that users favored the Android 6 permissions interface over Android 5's, the present study found no clear evidence that it was more effective than Android 5.

AB  - What does children's play look like in the smart toy era? What conceptual frameworks help make sense of the changing practices of children's connected play worlds? Responding to these questions, this article re-frames discussions about children's smart toy play within wider theoretical debates about the affordances of new digital materialities. To understand recent transformations of children's play practices, we propose it is necessary to think of toys as increasingly media-like in their affordances and as connected to wider digital material ecosystems. To demonstrate the potential of this conceptual approach, we explore illustrative examples of two popular smart care toys'. Our analysis identifies three examples of affordances that smart care toys share with other forms of mobile and robotic media: liveliness, affective stickiness and portability. We argue that locating discussions of smart toys within wider conceptual debates about digital materialities can provide new insights into the changing landscape of children's play.

AB  - Shyness has been reported to be closely associated with problematic mobile phone use, yet the underlying mechanism which may mediate or moderate this relationship remains obscure. Based on the cognitive-behavioral model of pathological internet use, combined with the theory of compensatory internet use and self-determination theory, the current study aimed to examine the association between shyness and problematic mobile phone use and the mediating role of social anxiety, as well as the moderating role of relatedness need satisfaction perceived on the mobile phone. A sample of 1050 Chinese adolescents recruited from middle schools completed the questionnaires. Mediation analysis revealed that social anxiety could partially mediate the relationship between shyness and problematic mobile phone use. Furthermore, moderated mediation analysis indicated that shyness could exacerbate problematic mobile phone use through social anxiety for adolescents with a higher level of relatedness need satisfaction from the mobile phone compared to a lower level of need satisfaction. Overall, these findings advance the understanding of how and when shyness leads to problematic mobile phone use. Implications for research on mobile phone use are discussed.

AB  - Smartphones have become very popular globally, and smartphone ownership has overtaken conventional cell phone ownership in many countries in recent years. With this rapid rise in smartphone penetration, researchers are looking at ways to conduct web surveys using smartphones. This is particularly true of student populations where smartphone penetration is very high and web surveys are already the norm. However, researchers are raising concerns about selection biases and measurement differences between PC and smartphone respondents. Questions also remain about comparisons to traditional interviewer-administered approaches. We designed an experimental comparison between a PC web survey, a smartphone web survey and a computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) survey. This study was conducted using an annual survey of students at a large university in South Korea. The CATI (interviewer-administered) survey had a higher response rate, lower margins of error, and better representation of the student population than the two web (self-administered) modes, but at a higher cost. The CATI survey also had lower rates of item nonresponse. More significant differences were found between the modes for sensitive questions than for nonsensitive ones. This suggests that CATI surveys may still have a role to play in surveys of college students, even in a country with high rates of mobile technology adoption.

AB  - This article reviews the existing literature on the collection of paradata in web surveys and extends the research in this area beyond the commonly studied measurement error problem to paradata that can be collected for managing and mitigating other important sources of error. To do so, and in keeping with the nature of paradata as process-oriented, we develop a typology of web survey paradata that incorporates information from all steps in the web survey process. We first define web survey paradata and describe general phases of paradata that run parallel to the steps in fielding a typical web survey. Within each phase, we enumerate several errors within the total survey error paradigm that can be examined with paradata, discussing case studies and motivating examples that illustrate innovative uses of paradata across the web survey process. We conclude with a discussion of open questions and opportunities for further work in this area. Overall, we develop this typology keeping technological advancements at the center of our discussion, but with flexibility to continuously incorporate new developments and trends in both technology and study design. Our typology encourages researchers to think about paradata as tools that can be used to investigate a broader range of outcomes than previously studied.

AB  - Introduction: Electronic cigarette (e-cig) device characteristics affect use but few studies have evaluated the types of devices commonly used or how users transition between devices. This study examines e-cig device usage patterns and explores the relationship between device transitions and continued use.
   Methods: E-cig users completed an online survey from 2012 to 2015 about their e-cig use, preferred device, and preferences and were followed-up via an emailed survey in January 2017. Continuing users were those reporting any e-cig use in the past 30 days at both time points while stoppers reported no use at follow-up. Means, frequencies, and Chi-square tests were used as appropriate to describe the sample, the transition between devices, and differences between groups.
   Results: The sample was 83.6% (n = 511) continuers and 16.3% (n = 100) stoppers. At follow-up, most continuers had transitioned to using more advanced devices like mods (62.6%) with variable voltage (67.7%) and/or wattage (76.8%) and with a tank system (78.6%). Nicotine concentration decreased by half from baseline to follow-up (p <.01). Baseline cigalike users were the most likely to report stopping e-cig use (p < .01) and the most likely to return to other tobacco use (p = .02).
   Conclusion: The majority of e-cig users continued exclusive e-cig use over 3+ years and were likely to transition to devices with more advanced characteristics like variable voltage and to reduce the nicotine concentration of their liquid. Baseline cigalike users were the most likely to stop e-cig use at follow-up.

AB  - In this study, we investigate whether mobile device use in surveys can be predicted. We aim to identify possible motives for device use and build a model by drawing on theory from technology acceptance research and survey research. We then test this model with a Structural Equation Modeling approach using data of seven waves of the GESIS panel. We test whether our theoretical model fits the data by focusing on measures of fit, and by studying the standardized effects of the model. Results reveal that intention to use a particular device can predict actual use quite well. Ease of smartphone use is the most meaningful variable: if people use a smartphone for specific tasks, their intention to use a smartphone for survey completion is also more likely. In conclusion, investing in ease of use of mobile survey completion could encourage respondents to use mobile devices. This can foremost be established by building well-designed surveys for mobile devices.

AB  - Although web surveys in which respondents are encouraged to use smartphones have started to emerge, it is still unclear whether they are a promising alternative to traditional web surveys in which most respondents use desktop computers. For sample members to participate in smartphone-based surveys, they need to have access to a smartphone and agree to use it to complete the survey; this raises concerns about coverage and nonresponse, as well as measurement if those who agree to participate have any difficulty using smartphones. In an analysis of data from a smartphone versus desktop (within-subjects) experiment conducted in a probability-based web panel, we compare estimates produced by the smartphone web survey (one condition) and PC web survey (other condition). We estimate mode effects and then examine the extent to which these effects are attributable to coverage, nonresponse, and measurement errors in the smartphone-based survey. While mode effects were generally small, we find that the smartphone web survey produced biased estimates relative to PC web for a subset of survey variables. This was largely due to noncoverage and, to a lesser extent, nonresponse. We find no evidence of measurement effects. Our findings point to the trade-off of the advanced data collection opportunities of smartphones and the potential selection errors that such devices may introduce.

AB  - With increasingly digitization, more and more information is collected from individuals and organizations, leading to several privacy concerns. These risks are further heightened in the mobile realm as data collection can occur continuously and ubiquitously. When individuals use their own devices in work settings, these issues become concerns for organization as well. The question then is how to ensure individuals perform proper information protection behaviors on mobile devices. In this research, we develop a model of mobile information protection based on an integration of the Theory of Planned Behavior and the information privacy literature to explore the antecedents of the attitude of individuals towards sharing information on their mobile devices, their intentions to use protective settings, and their actual practices. The model is tested with data from 228 iPhone users. The results indicate that mobile information protection intention leads to actual privacy settings practice, and that attitude towards information sharing and mobile privacy protection self-efficacy affect this intention. Determinants of attitude towards information sharing include mobile privacy concern and trust of the mobile platform. Finally, prior invasion experience is related to privacy concern. These findings provide insights into factors that can be targeted to enhance individuals' protective actions to limit the amount of digital information they share via their smartphones.

AB  - The increasing relevance of personal information has sparked a broad debate on privacy issues on the ubiquitous Internet. The so called 'privacy paradox' aims to explain through rational decision-making models the contradictions between stated digital privacy concerns and the actual behaviors in mobile platforms. An analysis of the emotions that arise when users know about unauthorized personal data disclosure is proposed. A survey of smartphone users was conducted shortly after the Cambridge Analytica / Facebook scandal took place, in order to analyze the nature and intensity of a user's emotions in relation to their knowledge of privacy breaches. The results support the paradox of privacy from an emotional perspective: although the reported emotions are intense, there is no relationship between the management that users make of their privacy settings in social networks and mobile applications and the nature and intensity of the emotions reported.

AB  - Little is known about the reliability and validity in web surveys, although this is crucial information to evaluate how accurate the results might be and/or to correct for measurement errors. In particular, there are few studies based on probability-based samples for web surveys, looking at web-specific response scales and considering the impact of having smartphone respondents. In this article, we start filling these gaps by estimating the measurement quality of sliders compared to radio button scales controlling for the device respondents used. We conducted therefore two multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) experiments in the Norwegian Citizen Panel (NCP), a probability-based online panel. Overall, we find that if smartphone respondents represent a nonnegligible part of the whole sample, offering the response options in form of a slider or a radio button scale leads to a quite similar measurement quality. This means that sliders could be used more often without harming the data quality. Besides, if there are no smartphone respondents, we find that sliders can also be used, but that the marker should be placed initially in the middle rather than on the left side. However, in practice, there is no need to shift from radio buttons to sliders since the quality is not highly improved by providing sliders.

AB  - A growing portion of internet users rely solely on mobile devices such as smartphones for their online access The percentage of "mobile-only" households increased from 9% in 2011 to 20% in 2015, more than doubling in only four years. As this shift continues, it leads to the question of what factors are driving the rise in mobile-only adoption. Using nationally representative data, this study uses logistic regressions and a decomposition technique to understand the trend. The decomposition reveals that a significant portion (65%) of the growth was due to an increase in the download speeds of mobile networks. An increased acceptance of mobile-only access by households aged 55 and older was also partly responsible. Understanding (and developing a response to) the trend towards mobile-only adoption will be important as organizations and governments continue to work to close the digital divide.

AB  - The saturation of mobile phones throughout Australia has led to some individuals being unable to regulate their use within situations that are inappropriate or risky. One of the most prevalent risky mobile phone use behaviours is texting while driving. Attempts to explain texting while driving suggest cognitive variables and personality characteristics are key factors. This study explored relationships between trait self-regulation, habitual text messaging, trait mindfulness, and texting while driving. One hundred and seventy participants comprising Australian undergraduate psychology students and members of the public completed an online survey measuring trait self-regulation, habitual text messaging behaviour, trait mindfulness, and frequency of texting while driving. It was found that habitual texting behaviour mediated the relationship between trait self-regulation and frequency of texting while driving. Additionally, trait mindfulness moderated the relationship between habit and texting while driving, such that habitual texting was significantly, positively related to texting while driving, but only for individuals with low to moderate trait mindfulness. These results suggest personality constructs related to attention, awareness, and control of behaviour play a significant role in counteracting the association that habitual texting behaviour has with the frequency of texting while driving. As these traits are considered malleable, this association may be applicable in future development of intervention programs aimed at increasing control over mobile phone use and reducing the frequency with which people text while driving.

AB  - Given the ever-rising frequency of malware attacks and other problems leading people to lose their files, backups are an important proactive protective behavior in which users can engage. Backing up files can prevent emotional and financial losses and improve overall user experience. Yet, we find that less than half of young adults perform mobile or computer backups regularly. To understand why, we model the factors that drive mobile and computer backup behavior, and changes in that behavior over time, using data from a panel survey of 384 diverse young adults. We develop a set of models that explain 37% and 38% of the variance in reported mobile and computer backup behaviors, respectively. These models show consistent relationships between Internet skills and backup frequency on both mobile and computer devices. We find that this relationship holds longitudinally: increases in Internet skills lead to increased frequency of computer backups. This article provides a foundation for understanding what drives young adults' backup behavior. It concludes with recommendations for motivating people to back up, and for future work, modeling similar user behaviors.

AB  - For a long time, a common opinion among policy-makers was that the digital divide problem would be solved when a country's Internet connection rate reaches saturation. However, scholars of the second-level digital divide have concluded that the divides in Internet skills and type of use continue to expand even after physical access is universal. This study-based on an online survey among a representative sample of the Dutch population-indicates that the first-level digital divide remains a problem in one of the richest and most technologically advanced countries in the world. By extending basic physical access combined with material access, the study finds that a diversity in access to devices and peripherals, device-related opportunities, and the ongoing expenses required to maintain the hardware, software, and subscriptions affect existing inequalities related to Internet skills, uses, and outcomes.

AB  - Parents can influence their children's problematic mobile phone involvement (PMPI) by engaging in parental mediation activities, such as restrictions or co-use, by being a role model, and by their general and domain-unspecific parenting style that facilitates more or less attachment security of the child. This study tested the associations between these different routes of influence-parental mediation of the mobile phone, parental PMPI, and secure child-parent attachment-with children's PMPI. Data was acquired from a quota-sample survey with 500 children, between 8 and 14 years of age, and one of their parents. Results point to the importance of open and empathic parent-child-communication, as well as a positive relationship quality, and demonstrate the detrimental effects of parents' own PMPI on children's PMPI.

AB  - The adoption of ride-sharing apps is critical to the survival of taxi drivers in the mobile-driven sharing economy. Based on survey data collected from 1195 licensed taxi drivers in Beijing, the authors present an integrated technology adoption model that combines technology and use factors (perceived usefulness and ease of use), social factors (word-of-mouth, peer adoption and subjective norms), system factors (socioeconomic and digital inequality), and audience factors (demographic characteristics and innovative personality traits). The results showed that adoption was innate, inherited, and socially driven. Adoption was positively associated with income, access to technologies, innovative personality trait, peer adoption, word-of-mouth, and perceived usefulness of the apps. The implications of the findings for inequality in the sharing economy are discussed.

AB  - We argue that the usage of mobile apps could be understood in the context of being permanently online. That is, contrary to functionalist theories, the usage of mobile apps is not simply an outcome based on the user's rational needs and goals but also reflects the new state of being in the online world of the mobile Internet environment. Following this approach, in this study we review the emerging concept of being permanently online, as well as two key influential factors: the fear of missing out (FOMO) and the feeling of acceleration. We then use the survey data collected from university students in Shanghai, China (N = 687) to examine the relationships between FOMO, the feeling of acceleration, being permanently online, and two types of mobile apps usage (i.e. WeChat and O2O life service apps). The results showed that in controlling for other variables, FOMO, the feeling of acceleration, and being permanently online were significantly related to mobile apps usage. In particular, FOMO was positively related to being permanently online. These empirical findings demonstrate the significance of examining mobile app usage from a new theoretical perspective, and they indicate that this approach deserves further attention in the research on this topic.

AB  - This paper uses as its base a key initiative involving a not-for-profit organisation (NPO), government start-up funding and a social enterprise which evolved through three phases. The purpose of the initiative was the development of a smart phone technology platform for people with disability. The paper's purpose is to answer questions about the ways in which the mobile technology, seen here as assistive technologies, supported the development of disability citizenship and active citizenship. Data were collected through in-depth interviews conducted at three points in the 13-week programme during which participants with disability received customised support for their phone and training in its use, at no cost. Fifteen participants volunteered to take part in the research project, along with their significant other and service provider. Key themes were identified in the preliminary analysis. Exploring these using Ragnedda's ([2017]. The third digital divide: A Weberian approach to digital inequalities. Abingdon: Routledge) three levels of digital divide, and Wilson's ([2006]. The information revolution and developing countries. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press) categories of access allowed a series of philosophical, ethical and human services management questions to emerge, challenging the optimism with which the digital economy is presented as a solution to issues of inequality. Although the mobile technologies were very successful as assistive technologies for some participants, the findings reinforced the potential for such technologies to further entrench aspects of social exclusion. They also identified ways in which the shift in the role of the NPO to social entrepreneurship, and its relationships with government and private enterprise, had the potential to undermine the exercise of disability citizenship by turning participants into consumers.

AB  - Purpose Using upper echelons theory (UET), the purpose of this paper is to unravel the influence of a CEO's ethical ideology on the presence of corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure on corporate websites. It also considers the CEO's perception of the importance of CSR (i.e. the extent of the CEO's detachment from the stockholder-oriented logic and attachment to the stakeholder-oriented logic).
   Design/methodology/approach First, a survey was sent to CEOs of large unlisted Belgian companies. Its intention was to assess CEOs' ethical ideology along the idealism and relativism dimensions and their perceptions on the importance of CSR (PRESOR-detachment-from-stockholder view; PRESOR-attachment-to-stakeholder view), and to gather some demographics. Second, a content analysis of corporate websites was conducted so as to classify companies as being either CSR disclosing or non-disclosing. Third, the annual accounts of these corporations were investigated and follow-up phone calls were conducted to obtain data on managerial discretion (MD).
   Findings CEOs' ethical ideology influences the degree to which they detach from the stockholder-oriented logic and attach to the stakeholder-oriented logic. Moreover, when MD is high, the degree of these CEOs' attachment to the stakeholder-oriented logic is the factor that influences the presence of CSR disclosure on their corporate websites. Finally, CEO's idealism indirectly influences the presence of CSR disclosure through the effect of idealism on the degree to which CEOs attach to the stakeholder-oriented logic.
   Originality/value This paper shows that, when MD is high, CEOs' values and perceptions influence CSR disclosure decisions. This study thereby enhances our knowledge regarding the internal drivers of CSR disclosure practices and offers UET as a lens through which the importance of CEOs' personal characteristics in the decision-making process might be further explored.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of smartphones and computers as web survey entry response devices on the quality of responses in different question formats and across different survey invitations delivery modes. The respondents' preference of device and the response immediacy were also compared.
   Design/methodology/approach Two field experiments were conducted with a cluster sampling and a census of all students in a public university in the USA.
   Findings Device effect on response quality was only found when using computer-aided self-interviews, but not in e-mail delivered web surveys. Even though the computer was the preferred device, but the smartphone's immediate response was significantly higher than the computer.
   Research limitations/implications The sample was restricted to college students who are more proficient users of smartphones and have high access to computers. But the direct comparison in the two studies using the same population increases the internal validity of the study comparing different web survey delivery modes.
   Practical implications Because of the minor differences in device on response quality, researchers can consider using more smartphones for field work such as computer-aided self-interviews to complement e-mail delivered surveys.
   Originality/value This is the first study that compares the response device effects of computer-aided self-interviews and e-mailed delivered web surveys. Because web surveys are increasingly used and various devices are being used to collect data, how respondents behave in different devices and the strengths and weaknesses of different methods of delivery survey help researchers to improve data quality and develop effective web survey delivery and participant recruitment.

AB  - The rising penetration of smartphones now gives researchers the chance to collect data from smartphone users through passive mobile data collection via apps. Examples of passively collected data include geolocation, physical movements, online behavior and browser history, and app usage. However, to passively collect data from smartphones, participants need to agree to download a research app to their smartphone. This leads to concerns about nonconsent and nonparticipation. In the current study, we assess the circumstances under which smartphone users are willing to participate in passive mobile data collection. We surveyed 1,947 members of a German nonprobability online panel who own a smartphone using vignettes that described hypothetical studies where data are automatically collected by a research app on a participant's smartphone. The vignettes varied the levels of several dimensions of the hypothetical study, and respondents were asked to rate their willingness to participate in such a study. Willingness to participate in passive mobile data collection is strongly influenced by the incentive promised for study participation but also by other study characteristics (sponsor, duration of data collection period, option to switch off the app) as well as respondent characteristics (privacy and security concerns, smartphone experience).

AB  - The acceptance of mobile technologies by employees is critical to their successful implementation in the workplace for competence development. Consequently, the type of job position (TJP) held was proposed as a new technology acceptance moderator and its significance verified. To examine this new moderator's role in explaining employees' intention to use technology, particularly mobile devices and applications for knowledge transfer, an extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model was elaborated that included the TJP moderator. A structural equation modelling approach was used to validate the model on the basis of data collected via a survey received from 810 employees from Poland, from 26 sectors, both public and private. The study results highlight that TJP moderates the significance and strength of selected factors influencing technology acceptance, such as: user autonomy, relative usability, social influence, performance expectancy, effort expectancy and facilitating conditions. Moreover social influence was confirmed to impact the behavioral intention to use mobile technologies for knowledge transfer for managers only. Inversely, user autonomy influence on perceived effort required to use mobile learning shown to exist for all TJP moderator values except for managers. Theoretical and practical implications of study are discussed.

AB  - Purpose - With the rapid surge of mobile marketing, an increasing number of brands have launched branded emoticons in an attempt to build brand relationships with consumers. Despite the apparent promise of branded emoticon usage, there is only limited academic research on branded emoticons. This paper aims to build on impression management theory and the conceptualization of cuteness to investigate how the effect of cuteness in branded emoticon design influences perceived playfulness in mobile instant messaging (MIM) interaction and the creation of brand engagement in self-concept.
   Design/methodology/approach - Consumers with usage experience of branded emoticons in MIM apps were recruited to complete an online survey. Partial least squares structural equation modelling was used to analyze the data.
   Findings - Two facets of cuteness - kindchenschema cuteness and whimsical cuteness - can project a favourable social image to consumers that facilitates playfulness in social interaction and enhances brand engagement in self-concept, which leads to their willingness to purchase the brand and stickiness to the MIM apps.
   Originality/value - The popularity of branded emoticons represents a new form of social interaction and an innovative way to build brand relationships. The present study is the first to examine the design aspects of branded emoticons and highlights that the cuteness of a branded emoticon may be a crucial factor in engaging consumers in MIM.

AB  - "Technology" is lately equated with hardware and software, but for the Ancient Greeks, a technology combined two linked features: the doing of an art/craft (techne) and theorizing about the doing (technologia). We thus consider a "technology" as a "sociotechnical system" - an entanglement of humans with one another, the tools, arts, crafts, practices and institutionalized forms of life of their time. Writing systems and new media are each relevant to understanding the roles of technologies in development, considered at an ontogenetic or historical level. We consider two ostensibly conflicting claims by Piaget that lead to the question of how the postnatal environment fundamentally differs from the intrauterine environment and how this difference changes the process of development. Vygotsky's focus on the cultural/historical mediation of social relations helps us understand the dynamic interplay of technology and development as part of a single process of human development - and to resolve Piaget's multifaceted views. To illustrate the insights offered by our cultural-historical approach, we compare the ancient period coupled with the development of literacy/numeracy and current historical circumstances in which new digital technologies are the focus. These two cases illuminate ways current changes are replaying in new circumstances a developmental process as old as Homo sapiens. (C) 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Mobile journalism is one of the fastest areas of growth in the modern journalism industry. Yet mobile journalists find themselves in a place of tension, between print, broadcast, and digital journalism and between traditional journalism and lifestyle journalism. Using the lens of field theory, the present study conducted an online survey of mobile journalists (N = 39) from six countries representing four continents on how they conceive of their journalistic role, and how their work is perceived within the newsroom. Participants were journalists in television, print, magazine, and digital local and national newsrooms. The present study sought to understand how mobile journalists see mobile production as a part of their journalistic role, and what field theory dimensions influence mobile production in their newsrooms. While prior research has established a growing prevalence of lifestyle journalism, the present study finds that the growth of mobile journalism represents the development of lifestyle journalism norms, such as content driven by the audience, within even traditional journalism.

AB  - Mobile device (e.g., smartphone) proficiency is becoming increasingly necessary to perform important everyday tasks, and inadequate proficiency can prevent groups of individuals such as older adults from obtaining the benefits of mobile computing and smartphone utilization. To facilitate mobile device training and research on barriers to mobile device use and adoption by older adults, Roque and Boot [1] developed the Mobile Device Proficiency Questionnaire (MDPQ). The current study is the first to assess the validity of the MDPQ based on confirmatory factor analysis and objective measures of their smartphone skills. In addition, it represents the first attempt to validate the MDPQ on a sample of older smartphone users. Results suggest that modifications may be necessary for the MDPQ to serve as a valid and reliable measure of proficiency among older adult smartphone users. In this sense, four important implications and recommendations for application of the MDPQ are discussed that could promote the general goal of ensuring that individuals of all ages can benefit from the use of smartphone devices and services such as mobile apps.

AB  - Mobile technologies have substantially changed how people consume media content, in particular during big events. This study examined audience's mobile experience with the 'first mobile Olympics' and found that motivations, preference, perceived usefulness, access to media technologies, and media use routine significantly predicted mobile use for big-event content. Additionally, fmdings suggest that compared to nonusers, mobile Olympics users were more intensely engaged and involved in sports and the Olympics overall, enjoyed a broader range of Olympics sports, and were more accustomed to using online and mobile sources to view media content. Television was still the dominant platform for big-event viewing, however, mobile consumption increased dramatically during the London Olympics, and indicated a need for more personalised, multifaceted programming with mobility and immediacy.

AB  - Prompted by the ongoing development of content personalization by social networks and mainstream news brands, and recent debates about balancing algorithmic and editorial selection, this study explores what audiences think about news selection mechanisms and why. Analysing data from a 26-country survey (N = 53,314), we report the extent to which audiences believe story selection by editors and story selection by algorithms are good ways to get news online and, using multi-level models, explore the relationships that exist between individuals' characteristics and those beliefs. The results show that, collectively, audiences believe algorithmic selection guided by a user's past consumption behaviour is a better way to get news than editorial curation. There are, however, significant variations in these beliefs at the individual level. Age, trust in news, concerns about privacy, mobile news access, paying for news, and six other variables had effects. Our results are partly in line with current general theory on algorithmic appreciation, but diverge in our findings on the relative appreciation of algorithms and experts, and in how the appreciation of algorithms can differ according to the data that drive them. We believe this divergence is partly due to our study's focus on news, showing algorithmic appreciation has context-specific characteristics.

AB  - How do digital communicative spaces facilitate legal mobilization, an emerging genre of social activism in China? What strategies do activists pursue in these spaces to sustain their resistance? Using a 2015 case study in Xiamen, Fujian Province, where an environmental nongovernmental organization led a lawsuit in the name of "pedestrians' rights," I seek to address these questions. This exploratory research illustrates how activists appropriate a "matrix of free spaces" available to them-a hybridized intersection of relatively stable organizational and digital spaces-for everyday organizing and for disseminating "citizenship talk," so that participants mobilize as citizens who invoke the law to effect policy change. It also reveals a snapshot of how collective solidarities may persist under authoritarian rule as well as the broader possibilities and challenges accompanying civic activism in China.

AB  - With the popularity of question-and-answer (Q&A) communities, widespread dissemination of scientific knowledge has become more viable than ever before. However, those contributing high-quality professional scientific knowledge are confronted with the challenge of making their contributions popular, since nonexpert readers may not recognize the importance of their contributions given the massive amount of information available online. In this study, we show that nonexpert readers are capable of evaluating the professionalism of content contributed in such communities as well as experts. However, we discovered that a salient discrepancy exists between the content nonexperts favor and the content they perceive as professional. In line with studies that have suggested that writing techniques play an important role in how expert content is received by laypersons, we investigated how the use of linguistic devices affects both the perceived professionalism and the popularity of contributions in Q&A communities. Based on both secondary data and a scenario-based survey, we identified specific linguistic devices that can increase content popularity without reducing perceived professionalism. Additionally, we revealed linguistic devices that increase popularity at the expense of perceived professionalism in this context. Finally, we conducted a laboratory experiment to more firmly establish the causal effects of the linguistic device use. The triangulated findings have important implications for both research and practice on communicating scientific knowledge in Q&A communities.

AB  - While the choice of matrix versus item-by-item questions has received considerable attention in the literature, it is still unclear in what situation one is better than the other. Building upon the previous findings, this study expands this line of research by examining whether the difference between the two question types is moderated by the number of response options. Through a web survey experiment, this study compares matrix and item-by-item questions with 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, and 11 response options. Additionally, we also investigate the impact of the device used to complete the survey on data quality. The results show that straight lining and response time are similar between the two question types across all response lengths, but item nonresponse tends to be higher for matrix than item-by-item question, especially among mobile respondents. Also measurement models reveal measurement equivalence between the two question types when there are fewer than seven response options. For matrices with 9 or 11 response options, analyses reveal substantial differences compared to item-by-item questions.

AB  - In theory, off-farm work, by raising household incomes, can have a direct impact on smartphone use among rural residents and the use of these smartphones in turn enhances incomes by facilitating online financial transactions, easing management tasks, strengthening social networks, providing technical services, and reducing exposure to risks. In light of this, this paper assesses the impact of participation in off-farm work on smartphone use, using an endogenous switching probit model and a survey of 493 rural households in China. The joint impacts of off-farm work participation and smartphone use on household income are also analyzed using a control function method. The results show that participation in off-farm work increases the probability of smartphone use significantly. Furthermore, we find that the household heads who engaged in off farm activities and who were smartphone users earned 3430 Yuan and 2643 Yuan more per capita annual income, respectively, compared to their full-time farming and smartphone-free counterparts.

AB  - While grids or matrix questions are a widely used format in PC web surveys, there is no agreement on the format in mobile web surveys. We conducted a two-wave experiment in an opt in panel in Russia, varying the question format (grid format and item-by-item format) and device respondents used for survey completion (smartphone and PC). The 1,678 respondents completed the survey in the assigned conditions in the first wave and 1,079 in the second wave. Overall, we found somewhat higher measurement error in the grid format in both mobile and PC web conditions. We found almost no significant effect of the question format on test-retest correlations between the latent scores in two waves and no differences in breakoff rates between the question formats. The multigroup comparison showed some measurement equivalence between the question formats. However, the difference varied depending on the length of a scale with a longer scale producing some differences in the measurement equivalence between the conditions. The levels of straightlining were higher in the grid than in the item-by-item format. In addition, concurrent validity was lower in the grid format in both PC and mobile web conditions. Finally, subjective indicators of respondent burden showed that the grid format increased reported technical difficulties and decreased subjective evaluation of the survey.

AB  - Introduction: Multi-site tobacco cessation trials could benefit from remote biochemical verification for tobacco use without invasive, time-consuming, or expensive collection processes. To the authors' knowledge, there have been no previous studies examining the predictive validity of oral fluid swabs for the detection of cotinine levels with samples collected off-site and mailed for on-site interpretation.
   Methods: Tobacco users were recruited through an online survey and participants who met the initial eligibility criteria were invited to take part. Those who elected to enroll provided two positive iScreen Oral Fluid Device (OFD) cotinine test samples during an in-office visit. One sample was used as a control and stored in a temperature-regulated location, while the other was mailed from one of ten surrounding counties. Mailing method and time from collection to mailing were varied, and results were assessed against control samples.
   Results: Twenty tobacco users enrolled in the study. Participants ranged in age from 18 to 31 (M = 16.45, SD = 1.54). Several types of tobacco use were reported, with electronic cigarettes the most commonly reported product. None of the mailed sample interpretations changed from pre- to post-mailing, with up to twenty-one days from sample collection to results confirmation.
   Conclusions: Results indicate that the use of mailed oral swabs may be an easy to use, reliable, and low-cost option for the detection of cotinine in tobacco users when in-person collection is not feasible. Test result interpretations were found to be unchanged after mailing, and after extended post-collection time gaps.

AB  - Mobile phones have become central to family members' daily communication. This study investigates the material and skills access barriers that parents of adolescents in resource-constrained contexts face for mobile relational maintenance. Following an exploratory sequential mixed-methods design, interviews with parents in Bogota, Colombia, explored how they managed to keep in touch with their children despite facing access barriers and how these barriers still affected their parent-child mobile interactions. A survey was conducted in the quantitative phase to confirm the relationship patterns suggested by qualitative findings. Financial, cognitive, and environmental resources constituted access barriers. Despite gaining material access through alternative social and environmental resources, the barriers they faced still influenced the nature and frequency of their parent-child mobile interactions. Findings also showed that cognitive barriers, observed as parents' low levels of perceived capability to learn how to use mobile phones, affected parents' text messaging through their acquisition of skills.

AB  - As revealed by Tapscott in his best-seller The Digital Economy published in 1994, the Internet has dramatically changed the way of conducting business and our daily lives. Further advancement of digital innovation, including cloud, mobile services, and artificial intelligence, has augmented this change significantly and provided us with extraordinary services and welfare never anticipated before. However, contrary to such an accomplishment, productivity in industrialized countries now confronts an apparent decline raising the question of a possible productivity paradox in the digital economy. The limitations of gross domestic product (GDP) statistics in measuring the advancement of the digital economy have become an important subject.
   While this mismatch is an old problem rooted in the dynamics of product innovations, since mismatch brought about by information and communication technology (ICT) is very strong, finding a solution to this critical issue has become highly crucial in the digital economy.
   Based on an intensive review of preceding studies and empirical analyses of national, industrial and individual behaviors in the digital economy, this paper attempted to draw a perspective on this critical issue.
   By means of an analysis of co-evolution among a shift in people's preferences from economic functionality to supra-functionality beyond economic value, the advancement of ICT and paradigm change to uncaptured GDP, a solution to this critical issue was investigated. New insights for measuring the digital economy were explored which provide insight into integration of national accounts with product-oriented micro-analysis efforts.

AB  - This paper presents results from a web-based study that investigates users' attitudes toward smart devices, focusing on acceptability. Specifically, we conducted a survey that elicits users' ratings of devices in isolation and devices in the context of tasks potentially performed by these devices. Our study led to insights about users' attitudes towards devices in isolation and in the context of tasks, and about the influence of demographic factors and factors pertaining to technical expertise and experience with devices on users' attitudes. The insights about users' attitudes provided the basis for two recommendation approaches based on principal components analysis (PCA) that alleviate the new-user and new-item problems: (1)employing latent features identified by PCA to predict ratings given by existing users to new devices, and by new users to existing devices; and (2)identifying a relatively small set of key questions on the basis of PCs, whose answers account to a large extent for new users' ratings of devices in isolation and in the context of tasks. Our results show that taking into account latent features of devices, and asking a relatively small number of key questions about devices in the context of tasks, lead to rating predictions that are significantly more accurate than global and demographic predictions, and substantially reduce prediction error, eventually matching the performance of strong baselines.

AB  - Technological advances in the information and knowledge society have influenced and transformed economic, social, and educational dynamics. Currently there are many digital gaps related to the access to technology, level of digital literacy, and social use. These gaps vary based on the age of the population and become more noticeable among elders. Digital illiteracy leads to the underusing of technological developments of the 21st century, making it difficult to take advantage of all the possibilities that they offer to our society. This study aims to analyze the level of penetration and use of handheld digital devices, especially the cellular phone, among the adult population. This study is based on the 2016 National Survey of Life Quality in Colombia, elaborated by Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadistica-DANE, specifically on the module of ownership and use of ICT goods. Results of four age groups are compared, which include 32 year olds or under, from ages 33 to 45 years, 46 to 59 years, and over 60 years. The sample consists of 37047 inhabitants of the Colombian territory, grouped by regions (Antioquia, Bogota, Caribbean, Eastern Central, Orinoquia, Amazonia, Pacific, San Andres, and Valle del Cauca). Data have been analyzed by descriptive and inferential statistical procedures, contingency tables analyses, and logistic regression, in order to identify and know the effect of age on the level of penetration and use of handheld digital devices when comparing results in young adults and elderly people. Findings show that young adults use these technologies to a greater proportion when compared to older adults, showing a significant correlation between age and the increase of digital gaps in access and social use of handheld digital devices. Results also make evident that digital divide in Colombia may be associated to the place of residence, as people who live in rural zones are the ones who suffer greater from inequalities.

AB  - Background: Phubbing is an increasingly common behavior that involves using a smartphone in a social setting of two or more people and interacting with the phone rather than with the other people. Research to date on phubbing has measured it using different scales or single questions, and therefore standard measures with appropriate psychometric properties are needed to improve its assessment. The aim of our study was to develop a Spanish version of the Phubbing Scale and to examine its psychometric properties: factor structure, reliability, and concurrent validity. Method: Participants were 759 Spanish adults between 18 and 68 years of age. They completed an online survey. Results: The results support a structure that is consistent with the original validation study, with two factors: Communication Disturbance and Phone Obsession. Internal consistency was found to be adequate. Evidence of concurrent validity was provided via a hierarchical regression model that showed positive associations with measures of internet addiction, Facebook intrusion, and fear of missing out. Conclusions: These results indicate that the Spanish version of the Phubbing Scale exhibits appropriate psychometric properties.

AB  - Design principles for survey questionnaires viewed on desktop and laptop computers are increasingly being seen as inadequate for the design of questionnaires viewed on smartphones. Insights gained from empirical research can help those conducting mobile surveys to improve their questionnaires. This article reports on a systematic literature review of research presented or published between 2007 and 2016 that evaluated the effect of smartphone questionnaire design features on indicators of response quality. The evidence suggests that survey designers should make efforts to optimize their questionnaires to make them easier to complete on smartphones, fit question content to the width of smartphone screens to prevent horizontal scrolling, and choose simpler types of questions (single-choice questions, multiple-choice questions, text-entry boxes) over more complicated types of questions (large grids, drop boxes, slider questions). Based on these results, we identify design heuristics, or general principles, for creating effective smartphone questionnaires. We distinguish between five of them: readability, ease of selection, visibility across the page, simplicity of design elements, and predictability across devices. They provide an initial framework by which to evaluate smartphone questionnaires, though empirical testing and further refinement of the heuristics is necessary.

AB  - Across the developing world, the spread of mobile- and smartphones has led to a surge in mobile services for rural populations. While the potentials of mobile services to provide development opportunities for smallholder farmers are widely acknowledged, the potentials to use smartphone applications to collect data on smallholder farming systems are little explored. Yet, researchers studying farming systems need good quality data. So far, data on smallholder farming systems is typically collected using household surveys. Survey questions are prone to recall biases, however, which can be substantial. This paper assesses whether smartphone can be used to collect data in real time and thus increase the accuracy of socioeconomic and agronomic data collection. In this paper, we present a smartphone application that was developed for this purpose. We use the application to analyze the effects of agricultural mechanization on intra-household time-use and nutrition in rural Zambia. While the early, descriptive results shed interesting light on the effects of mechanization, the contribution of this study is primarily methodological. The study highlights the potentials of using smartphone applications to collect socioeconomic and agronomic data on smallholder-farming systems, potentially in real time. It also suggests ways to combine data recorded by respondents with built-in sensors of smartphones and external sensors and thus shows fascinating new pathways for researchers in the digital age.

AB  - Background: Mobile phone use while driving is a well-recognized area of concern. However, while texting/calling among young adult drivers has received much research attention, more research is needed regarding other phone functions used by young adults while driving.
   Study aim: To explore mobile phone functions used by young adult drivers while driving.
   Results: An online survey of 17-24 year old drivers (N=612; 428 females) and focus groups with drivers aged (N=18; 8 females) revealed that mobile phone use while driving was a very common behavior, with more full licence drivers compared with Learner/Provisional drivers using their phone to make/answer calls, send/read text messages and for internet browsing. This nature of mobile phone use while driving was varied, with phones commonly used for entertainment (e.g., to play music), to connect with others (via texting and/or voice calls) and for navigation.
   Concluding remarks: Young adults use a variety of functions on their phone while driving. It is important that young driver-targeted intervention efforts acknowledge that multiple functions of the mobile phone are used during the drive and it serves multiple purposes. Examining the inhibitors and facilitators of mobile phone use and its various functions while driving is needed, in addition to elucidating if the usage of particular mobile phone functions is similar across different driver cohorts.

AB  - This paper proposes an ecological view to investigate how disparities in mobile technology use reflect vulnerabilities in communities vis-a-vis disaster preparedness. Data (n=1,603) were collected through a multi-country survey conducted equally in rural and urban areas of Indonesia, Myanmar, Philippines, and Vietnam, where mobile technology has become a dominant and ubiquitous communication and information medium. The findings show that smartphone users' routinised use of mobile technology and their risk perception are significantly associated with disaster preparedness behaviour indirectly through disaster-related information sharing. In addition to disaster-specific social support, smartphone users' disaster-related information repertoires are another strong influencing factor. In contrast, non-smartphone users are likely to rely solely on receipt of disaster-specific social support as the motivator of disaster preparedness. The results also reveal demographic and rural-urban differences in disaster information behaviour and preparedness. Given the increasing shift from basic mobile phone models to smartphones, the theoretical and policy-oriented implications of digital disparities and vulnerability are discussed.

AB  - In 2013 the Mexican Telecommunications and Broadcasting Reform was launched with the goal of promoting competition and access in the telecommunications sector. The aim of this paper is to evaluate whether the 2013 reform had an impact on household fixed internet adoption and to what extent Mexican households, classified into ten wealth groups, had adopted intemet. For the assessment, after a revision of supply and demand Reform's measures to reduce the digital divide, data from the 2010 Census and 2015 Intercensal Survey were used to create adoption indexes using Poisson estimations. The results were analyzed by ten wealth groups, constructed on principal components based on household characteristics (type of dwelling, electricity availability, availability of drinking water, sewer system, intemet and ICT devices: computer, telephone, cell phone and intemet). Additionally, the impact of both indexes was validated by a difference in differences method. The results suggest a 66% overall increase in intemet adoption between 2010 and 2015. The decile analysis showed considerable intemet adoption in the low and middle wealth groups (deciles 2-8), while in the highest wealth groups (deciles 9-10) the impact of internet adoption has been relatively moderate. It is worth noting that interne adoption is unequally distributed, as less than 1% of households in deciles 1 to 6 had adopted internet in 2015, while nearly all of the wealthiest ten percent of households have intemet access. Nevertheless the increment in interne adoption was not only the result of the reform but the combination of the broadband penetration trend and the reform together.

AB  - Driver visual distraction due to the prevalence of mobile phone engagement has become a major safety concern for transport authorities worldwide. Despite long-term efforts to prevent engagement in mobile phone tasks, drivers continue to use their phones while driving. To develop better policy and prevention practices, gaining an understanding of the predictors and strategies utilised by drivers who use their mobile phone for distracting tasks is necessary. Visually intensive tasks are the main interest of this investigation, e.g., texting and browsing. In an online questionnaire in Queensland (Australia), of the 484 drivers who participated, a 33.5% (n = 162) of respondents reported using a mobile phone for texting and browsing while driving on a typical day. Answers from these participants were analysed for this study. Negative binomial regression was used to model the effect of the independent variables (personal characteristics, perceived crash risk, beliefs, workload management strategies, and police avoidance strategies) over the rate of texting/browsing events per hour driving. The final statistical model confirmed that drivers who reported previous collisions; who believed that the effects of doing the texting/browsing task would last after it was finished; and who reported keeping their phone low to avoid police had an increased texting/browsing incidence rate. Comparably, drivers who held a valid driving license for longer; who perceived larger crash risk regarding texting/browsing behaviour; who avoided mobile phone use in demanding driving conditions; and who used workload management strategies such as reduced speed when engaged in mobile phone use had a reduced texting/browsing incidence rate. The results provide insights into the limitations of actual enforcement control and potential opportunities for countermeasures.

AB  - Does completing a web survey on a smartphone or tablet computer reduce the quality of the data obtained compared to completing the survey on a laptop computer? This is an important question, since a growing proportion of web surveys are done on smartphones and tablets. Several earlier studies have attempted to gauge the effects of the switch from personal computers to mobile devices on data quality. We carried out a field experiment in eight counties around the United States that compared responses obtained by smartphones, tablets, and laptop computers. We examined a range of data quality measures including completion times, rates of missing data, straightlining, and the reliability and validity of scale responses. A unique feature of our study design is that it minimized selection effects; we provided the randomly determined device on which respondents completed the survey after they agreed to take part. As a result, respondents may have been using a device (e.g., a smartphone) for the first time. However, like many of the prior studies examining mobile devices, we find few effects of the type of device on data quality.

AB  - The horizontally scrolling format, where text is presented in a single line drifting right to left, is relatively commonly used to display text on digital screens. This format presents a potentially challenging reading situation as the text must be followed smoothly to the left (to track individual words) while rightward eye movements are made as usual to progress through the text. This conflict may reduce attention allocated to upcoming text. Returning to previously encountered text is also more difficult with this format. Here, a sustained reading comprehension task was used to compare performance with horizontally scrolling and multi-line static text formats. Results showed that literal comprehension can be reasonably well maintained with scrolling text, although small decrements are seen at faster scrolling rates. However, they indicated that this format makes it more difficult to answer questions requiring an inference to be made. The contribution of working memory capacity and the impact of display speed on these effects were considered. These findings have implications for the application of this format in digital media and also more widely for the conditions required for successful in-depth reading comprehension with any text format.

AB  - Many companies compete globally in a world in which user ratings and price are important drivers of performance but whose importance may differ by country. This study builds on the cultural, economic, and structural differences across countries to examine how app popularity reacts to price and ratings, controlling for product characteristics. Estimated across 60 countries, a dynamic panel model with product-specific effects reveals that price sensitivity is higher in countries with higher masculinity and uncertainty avoidance. Ratings valence sensitivity is higher in countries with higher individualism and uncertainty avoidance, while ratings volume sensitivity is higher in countries with higher power distance and uncertainty avoidance and those that are richer and have more income equality. For managers, the authors visualize country groups and calculate how much price should decrease to compensate for a negative review or lack of reviews. For researchers, they highlight the moderators of the volume and valence effects of online ratings, which are becoming ubiquitous in this connected world.

AB  - The advent of mobile technologies in learning context, has been increased the requirements for developing appropriate usability model to align with mobile learning applications. Even though mobile learning has been studied from different aspects of pedagogy environment and technology acceptance, there is little scientific and published research on usability of mobile learning applications. To fill up the gap, in this study, a usability evaluation model with the inclusion of timeliness is developed to assess the usability of mobile learning applications. Timeliness or response time as an important feature in mobile learning, which influences learning satisfaction, can be considered to evaluate the peers and instructors' timely response. The main objective of this study is to construct and validate a usability evaluation survey for mobile learning environments. This study employed a two round Delphi method to empirically verify the usability questionnaire by obtaining a consensus from fourteen experts regarding the questionnaire items. Results indicate that over 88% of experts have consented on all usability items represented in the usability questionnaire. The usability evaluation survey for mobile learning applications can help to improve user satisfaction and reductions in training costs. The decrease in costs attracts many researchers, interface designers and project managers to employ the usability evaluation when designing the interfaces for mobile learning applications.

AB  - Motorcyclist safety is a major concern in many developing countries. Understanding motorcycle riders' risky behaviours, particularly among the younger population, is essential to developing effective interventions. This paper explores the correlations between mobile phone use while riding and other risky riding behaviours as well as the relationships between perceived risks and risky riding behaviours, using an online survey of university students in Vietnam. Results show that calling while riding a motorcycle had the highest prevalence (74%) while reckless overtaking had the lowest prevalence (33.2%). Survey participants who indicated that they had the behaviours of reckless overtaking or riding on sidewalks were around twice as likely to call, text, or search for information while riding. In addition, those who admitted that they rode a motorcycle while under the influence of alcohol were nearly twice as likely to call or text while riding. The results also show that perceived crash risks reduced the likelihood of risky riding behaviours, including calling, texting, searching for information, speeding, running red lights, riding on the wrong side of a road, and riding on sidewalks. A more coordinated approach to enforcement is needed to help reduce the prevalence of multiple risk taking behaviours among motorcyclists.

AB  - An increasingly competitive fundraising environment and the new media ecosystem have prompted nonprofit organizations to strengthen their digital marketing capabilities. Recently, a few nonprofits have used virtual reality (VR) technology in fundraising, which raises questions about its effectiveness. Does VR work, and if so, through what psychological mechanisms? Through a lab experiment, the usefulness of VR as a digital fundraising tool was investigated. Specifically, we compared the media effects of experiencing the same fundraising video on two different devices: (a) a head-mounted VR and (b) a tablet. The results revealed that donation intention, perceived vividness, perceived interactivity, and social presence were all significantly greater with the VR medium than with the tablet medium. Next, we tested and successfully verified the mediation effect of social presence on donation intention. Finally, we verified that a viewer's sensation-seeking tendency served as a moderator when the device type influenced donation intention. Specifically, the media effects of VR were stronger for high sensation seekers than for low sensation seekers. This study contributes to theory and research by verifying the VR fundraising effect and identifying the key role of social presence, and it also provides important managerial guidelines for media design in VR fundraising campaigns.

AB  - Millions of people retrieve their emails and files using their smartphones, yet smartphone retrieval of such personal information has never been studied or compared to retrievals from PCs. In our within-subjects study, we compared the retrievals of our 57 participants in four conditions: files using PCs, emails using PCs, files using smartphones, and emails using smartphones. Our results indicate that when using smartphones, retrievals were significantly less successful and efficient than when using PCs, casting doubt on the implicit assumption that the use of these devices is equivalent. Our results also indicate that participants used the search facility for emails about seven times more than for files, which can encourage vendors to invest more efforts in improving email search engines and file navigation systems. Finally, we found that the tendency to search shows interpersonal differences but consistency across different situations for the same individual and therefore can be regarded as a personal trait. Future research can attempt to explain the search tendency trait in terms of cognitive abilities and personality traits, incorporating it to well-established theories. This may pave the way to a new trait-related theory in the field of information science.

AB  - Whereas substance-use researchers have long combined self-report with objective measures of behavior and physiology inside the laboratory, developments in mobile/wearable electronic technology are increasingly allowing for the collection of both subjective and objective information in participants' daily lives. For self-report, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), as implemented on contemporary smartphones or personal digital assistants, can provide researchers with near-real-time information on participants' behavior and mood in their natural environments. Data from portable/wearable electronic sensors measuring participants' internal and external environments can be combined with EMA (e.g., by timestamps recorded on questionnaires) to provide objective information useful in determining the momentary context of behavior and mood and/or validating participants' self-reports. Here, we review three objective ambulatory monitoring techniques that have been combined with EMA, with a focus on detecting drug use and/or measuring the behavioral or physiological correlates of mental events (i.e., emotions, cognitions): (1) collection and processing of biological samples in the field to measure drug use or participants' physiological activity (e.g., hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity); (2) global positioning system (GPS) location information to link environmental characteristics (disorder/ disadvantage, retail drug outlets) to drug use and affect; (3) ambulatory electronic physiological monitoring (e.g., electrocardiography) to detect drug use and mental events, as advances in machine learning algorithms make it possible to distinguish target changes from confounds (e.g., physical activity). Finally, we consider several other mobile/wearable technologies that hold promise to be combined with EMA, as well as potential challenges faced by researchers working with multiple mobile/wearable technologies simultaneously in the field.

AB  - When used in a mobile ecosystem, social Web applications are commonly criticized due to their poor quality. We believe this is accounted for by the inadequacy of current approaches for their evaluation as well as the lack of suitable quality models. With an objective to address the aforementioned issues, this paper introduces a quality model that captures the particularities of social Web applications when used on mobile devices. Drawing on the comprehensive literature review, a finite set of performance variables (items, attributes, and categories) that contribute to the mobile quality of social Web applications was identified and subsequently employed for the purpose of designing a conceptual model in the form of a mobile quality requirements tree. An empirical study was then carried out to assess the reliability and validity of the conceptual model and pertaining measuring instrument. During the study, participants accomplished predefined scenarios of interaction with a representative sample of social Web applications for collaborative writing and evaluated their mobile quality by completing the post-use questionnaire. An analysis of data collected from end users uncovered a relevance of performance variables at different levels of granularity in a mobile quality requirements tree as well as pros and cons of evaluated collaborative editors.

AB  - This article reviews the experience, steps taken, and lessons learnt from including a virtual reality film within a mobile online survey. The survey was designed to test point-of-sale displays within a retail store environment, with respondents exposed to the store using virtual reality within the survey, rather than being a shown a static image or a standard film of the store's interior. The results show how incorporating a virtual reality film within a survey can significantly add to the survey enjoyment compared to traditional approaches. The findings show how the uniqueness of the virtual reality experience can help engage respondents, offering a modern and relevant way to provide a more realistic survey experience that respondents are receptive to. The study also demonstrates that it is technically feasible to incorporate a virtual reality experience into an online survey among typical panelists, without high failure rates or the need to over-incentivise to participate. This article discusses the use of virtual reality within surveys and the practical steps taken to incorporate the virtual reality film, as well as the key !earnings generated from the experience. The future potential for the application of virtual reality technology within research is also explored.

AB  - The use of agree/disagree (A/D) questions is a common technique to measure attitudes. For instance, this question format is employed frequently in the Eurobarometer and International Social Survey Programme (ISSP). Theoretical considerations, however, suggest that A/D questions require a complex processing. Therefore, many survey researchers have recommended the use of item-specific (IS) questions, since they seem to be Less burdensome. Parallel to this methodological discussion is the discussion around the use of mobile devices for responding to surveys. However, until now, evidence has been lacking as to whether the use of mobile devices for survey response affects the performance of established question formats. In this study, implemented in the Netquest panel in Spain (N = 1,476), we investigated the cognitive effort and response quality associated with A/D and IS questions across PCs and smartphones. For this purpose, we applied a split-ballot design defined by device type and question format. Our analyses revealed longer response times for IS questions than A/D questions, irrespective of the device type and scale length. Also, the IS questions produced better response quality than their A/D counterparts. All in all, the findings indicate a more conscientious response to IS questions compared to A/D questions.

AB  - This study tests two models of perceptual disconfirmation. Perceptual disconfirmation occurs when individuals have a negative expectation regarding their future conversation partners' demeanor, but after conversing with and influencing their partners' behavior, individuals' assessment of their partners' demeanor becomes more positive. This effect is, so far, novel to computer-mediated communication: When individuals with similar expectancies get acquainted using phone or face-to-face channels their negative preinteraction expectancies persist and assessments remain unchanged. This experiment explored the extent to which questions and disclosures, and partners' disclosive responses, mediated perceptual disconfirmation. Individuals were led to believe that a dyadic conversation partner was either in a bad mood (negative and malleable expectation) or had a bad personality (negative and nonmalleable expectation). After a 30-min online conversation to get acquainted, perceptual disconfirmation emerged, although the verbal strategies did not mediate the effect. This study raises new questions about the process by which individuals who have negative expectancies of their future conversation partners defy these negative expectations and shift their attitudes to become more positive online.

AB  - Mobile device use has become increasingly prevalent, yet its impact on infant development remains largely unknown. When parents use mobile devices in front of infants, the parent is physically present but most likely distracted and unresponsive. Research using the classic Still Face Paradigm (SFP) suggests that parental withdrawal and unresponsiveness may have negative consequences for children's social-emotional development. In the present study, 50 infants aged 7.20 to 23.60 months (M = 15.40, SD = 4.74) and their mothers completed a modified SFP. The SFP consisted of three phases: free play (FP; parent and infant play and interact), still face (SF; parent withdraws attention and becomes unresponsive), and reunion (RU; parent resumes normal interaction). The modified SFP incorporated mobile device use in the SF phase. Parents reported on their typical mobile device use and infant temperament. Consistent with the standard SFP, infants showed more negative affect and less positive affect during SF versus FP. Infants also showed more toy engagement and more engagement with mother during FP versus SF and RU. Infants showed the most social bids during SF and more room exploration in SF than RU. More frequent reported mobile device use was associated with less room exploration and positive affect during SF, and less recovery (i.e., engagement with mother, room exploration positive affect) during RU, even when controlling for individual differences in temperament. Findings suggest that the SFP represents a promising theoretical framework for understanding the impact of parent's mobile device use on infant social-emotional functioning and parent-infant interactions.

AB  - An important part of current research regarding online risks is aimed at analysing cyber aggression according to its frequency and type. By contrast, there is less scientific knowledge available on risk perception, the analysis of its components, and the measurement and impact on the behaviour of minors on the Internet. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to establish a classification of minors based on their perception of risk, digital consumption habits, family and/or educational protection factors, and the flow of communication. A structured questionnaire was used from a sample of 865 minors aged 10 to 17 from the Autonomous Region of Madrid. Data were processed using SPSS 15.0 and SPAD 5.0. After a factor and classification analysis was conducted, seven different groups were obtained. The predominant profile, in 42% of the cases, is that of a 'prudent person', characterized by a high perception of risk, not spending an excessive amount of time on the Internet, avoiding unsafe behaviour, talking with parents about online difficulties, receiving advice, and having clear rules on Internet use. The perception of risk is shown as a relevant construct in relation to other indicators such as child-rearing techniques used by parents, the time children spend on Internet, dependency on the device, and the type of digital behavior involved.

AB  - This article examines the extent to which economic, cultural, social, and personal types of engagement with the Internet result in a variety of economic, cultural, social, and personal outcomes. Data from a representative survey of the Dutch population are analyzed to test whether engagement with a certain type of activity is related to collateral benefits in different domains of activities, independent from the socioeconomic or sociocultural characteristics of the person. The results show that what people do online and the skills they have affect outcomes in other domains and that this is independent of the characteristics of the person. This means that policy and interventions could potentially overcome digital inequalities in outcomes through skills training and providing opportunities to engage online in a broad variety of ways. A semiologic rather than an economistic approach is more likely to be effective in thinking about and tackling digital inequalities.

AB  - This study takes place from the idea that the personal usage of mobile technologies can bring positive outcomes to the user and to their society in an indirect way. Technologies studied in this work are defined as persuasive technologies (Fogg, 1997) because they are intentionally designed to modify the users' attitude or behavior. This research is aimed to evaluate if the intention to use the application can be influenced by positive attitudes toward technology, by the persuasive power of the application and by the perceived fun. Participants (N = 118; M = 55; F = 63; mean age = 27.4; range age = 1569) filled in an online questionnaire that was partly based on the Media and Technology Usage and Attitude Scale (MTUAS - Rosen et al., 2013). An additional eight items were added to the scale, aimed at evaluating participants' technophobia, technophilia, perceived technology pervasiveness and perceived persuasive power of technology. By using linear regression analysis, it was found that the application's informational power and the perceived entertainment positively influenced the usage intention. Another interesting result, obtained through ANOVA, concerns a generational difference: baby boomers tended to trust more the fact that the single individual action through the application can have an effective impact on the environment. These results represent a basis for future in-depth investigations about socially relevant use of the ICT.

AB  - The diffusion and adoption of modern information technology provide new chance for China to close urban-rural income gap. This paper uses China's provincial panel data from 2002 to 2013 to investigate the effect of computer penetration on rural residents' income. A public program aiming to connect every village with broadband Internet and other rural facilities provides plausibly exogenous variation in rural residents' availability and adoption of the broadband Internet, which is used to explore the instrument variable for rural computer penetration. The results show that rural computer penetration tends to increase rural residents' income over time, but the average effect remains limited. The dynamic panel threshold effects model, which allows for both the threshold variable and other covariates to be endogenous, is further used to explore the constraints of the income-increase effect of rural computer penetration. It shows that the effect is at least doubled over the average effect estimated from instrument variables method, once the digital divide causes are removed. Our findings have important implications for the government to increase rural residents' income and reduce urban-rural income gap by encouraging rural computer usage and removing the digital divide.

AB  - Because mobile virtual reality (VR) is both mobile and immersive, three-dimensional (3D) visualizations of disaster scenes based in mobile VR enable users to perceive and recognize disaster environments faster and better than is possible with other methods. To achieve immersion and prevent users from feeling dizzy, such visualizations require a high scene-rendering frame rate. However, the existing related visualization work cannot provide a sufficient solution for this purpose. This study focuses on the construction and optimization of a 3D disaster scene in order to satisfy the high frame-rate requirements for the rendering of 3D disaster scenes in mobile VR. First, the design of a plugin-free browser/server (B/S) architecture for 3D disaster scene construction and visualization based in mobile VR is presented. Second, certain key technologies for scene optimization are discussed, including diverse modes of scene data representation, representation optimization of mobile scenes, and adaptive scheduling of mobile scenes. By means of these technologies, smartphones with various performance levels can achieve higher scene-rendering frame rates and improved visual quality. Finally, using a flood disaster as an example, a plugin-free prototype system was developed, and experiments were conducted. The experimental results demonstrate that a 3D disaster scene constructed via the methods addressed in this study has a sufficiently high scene-rendering frame rate to satisfy the requirements for rendering a 3D disaster scene in mobile VR.

AB  - We study how digital service firms can develop an active customer base, focusing on two questions. First, how does the way that customers use the service postadoption to meet their own needs (personal usage) and to interact with one another (social usage) vary across customer acquisition methods? Second, how do firm-to-customer and customer-to-customer communications promote different types of usage? We study these questions using two data sets and by developing a multivariate hierarchical Poisson hidden Markov model (HMM), which fits the data significantly better than univariate and latent class approaches. We indeed find that postadoption behavior varies depending on customer acquisition method and dynamic states. At the total usage level, in one context (an annotation and note-taking service), customers who heard about the service through search and mass-invite exhibited significantly higher usage compared to those who joined through word of mouth (WOM), whereas in another context (a cloud-based file storage service), customers who joined through WOM referrals tended to exhibit higher usage. Yet, examining how routes of adoption relate to specific types of behavior, personal versus social usages, reveals a more nuanced picture. Furthermore, in both contexts, communications postadoption influenced engagement, albeit in different ways. Firm-to-customer communications, through company posts to Twitter and blog entries, had varying effects on customer behavior and in some cases led to lower personal and/or social usage; however, customer-to-customer communications tended to increase personal-use engagement across latent states and in both data sets. The findings suggest that firms offering digital services should pay attention to how the mode of customer acquisition is related to subsequent usage intensity, accounting for both personal and social activity, and encourage customers to interact with each other postadoption.

AB  - Much research has been done comparing grids and item-by-item formats. However, the results are mixed, and more research is needed especially when a significant proportion of respondents answer using smartphones. In this study, we implemented an experiment with seven groups (n = 1,476), varying the device used (PC or smartphone), the presentation of the questions (grids, item-by-item vertical, item-by-item horizontal), and, in the case of smartphones only, the visibility of the "next" button (always visible or only visible at the end of the page, after scrolling down). The survey was conducted by the Netquest online fieldwork company in Spain in 2016. We examined several outcomes for three sets of questions, which are related to respondent behavior (completion time, lost focus, answer changes, and screen orientation) and data quality (item missing data, nonsubstantive responses, instructional manipulation check failure, and nondifferentiation). The most striking difference found is for the placement of the next button in the smartphone item-by-item conditions: When the button is always visible, item missing data are substantially higher.

AB  - This study employs an integrated approach based on the technology acceptance model (TAM) to examine online experience by combining design features and social factors. It also explores the interrelationships between online experience and smartphone users' destination image. A pretest was conducted to examine the internal construct structure through exploratory factor analysis. In the main field test, a survey company distributed online questionnaires to recruited smartphone users. Confirmatory factor analysis was employed to confirm reliability and validity, and a structural equation modeling test with maximum likelihood estimation was performed to identify the relationships among the constructs. The results suggest that perceived usefulness and ease of use are important factors that enhanced users' online experience with smartphone applications. Positive relationships exist between users' online experiences and cognitive and affective image. Furthermore, both of these factors positively contribute to overall destination image. This study contributes to the extant literature by identifying the momentous impact of mobile technology on destination image formation, and a new perspective of extending the TAM by measuring users' online experience of smartphone applications is provided for the future studies. Marketing implications and limitations are discussed.

AB  - In the changing news environment, young adult audiences, often dubbed the Internet generation', have increasingly gravitated toward online sources of news and information, raising questions about the nature and amount of news consumed. This study joins many others in looking at the emerging processes of news consumption among, in this case, college students, using focus group interviews to further examine how they go about obtaining news. Drawing upon literature in the areas of news consumption, media habits, generational change and news repertoire, this study identifies an emerging three-stage process of consumption that includes the following: routine surveillance, incidental consumption, and directed consumption, each conditioned by various forms of new media use. It suggests continued research in the interaction of a changing media ecology with generational adoption of news habits and the implications of this interaction for news and news engagement.

AB  - How do people find answers to questions they encounter in everyday life? While extensive research has examined how people go about finding answers to questions online, there has been little work investigating the issue from a more holistic, in situ perspective that covers the various devices, resources, and contextual factors that influence everyday question-asking experiences. To address this, we developed a text-messaging-based data-collection framework. This paper details our approach including reflections on both the benefits and challenges of the methodology for researchers seeking to apply similar approaches to social science research. In doing so, we demonstrate how our methodology helps establish a contextually rich understanding of information-seeking processes. We also demonstrate our approach to analyzing data from a small but diverse group of adults across the United States about their everyday question-asking experiences.

AB  - In order to investigate the developing trend of SoLoMo technology in the current mobile communication technology (MCT) era, this research cross-employs the, factor analysis approach, technology acceptance model and analytical network process model to construct the most effective evaluation model. In order to strengthen the research representativeness, this research hierarchically cross-measures the results of the first 268 valid questionnaires given to random technological users to detect the demands of numerous users and the second 15 valid surveyed questionnaires given to 15 experts in relative technological management fields to refine the evaluated results and conclusion. Contributively, the most three valuable findings are (1) Web 3.0 technology (W3) of perceived usefulness, technological appropriate format of perceived ease of use, user's empathy of attitude toward using and user's reliability of behavioral intention to use are the most influenced determinant of SoLoMo technology; (2) these determinants are the positive influences of external variables during users utilizing newest technology in the current MCT era (PIEV), testified by fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis method of qualitative analysis and (3) specifically, the interviewed questionnaires have further pointed out that the numerous users have not only focused on the diversified formats of information, multiple connection and media of Web 3.0 technology but also paid more attentions on the reliability and accuracy.

AB  - In this article, we present a study on the data quality and the response process of mobile online surveys using an experimental design as compared to a standard computer. We used the following indicators to measure data quality and response properties: reaction time to survey invitation, break-off rate, item nonresponse, length of responses to open-ended questions and survey transmission, processing, and completion time. With regard to completion time, we also explored the significance of the place as well as the situation in which the survey was completed, the kind of Internet connection the respondents had as well as the hardware properties of the devices used to answer the online survey. Our results suggest comparable data quality and response properties in most aspects: There were no noticeable differences between computer and mobile users as regards break-off rate, item nonresponse, and length of responses to open-ended questions, nor the place where the survey was completed. However, it took respondents in the mobile group longer to complete the survey as compared to respondents answering the online survey on their computer. In terms of the completion time, there was a significant decrease in the differences between mobile devices and PCs when respondents used technically advanced mobile devices and had access to a fast Internet connection.

AB  - While recent evidence has pointed to disturbances in emotion regulation strategy use in schizophrenia, few studies have examined how these regulation strategies relate to emotionality and social behavior in daily life. Using ecological momentary assessment (EMA), we investigated the relationship between emotion regulation, emotional experience, and social interaction in the daily lives of individuals with schizophrenia. Participants (N = 30) used mobile phones to complete online questionnaires reporting their daily emotional experience and social interaction. Participants also completed self-report measures of habitual emotion regulation. Hierarchical linear modeling revealed that self-reported use of cognitive reappraisal and savoring of emotional experiences were related to greater positive emotion in daily life. In contrast, self-reported suppression was related to greater negative emotion, reduced positive emotion, and reduced social interaction in daily life. These findings suggest that individual differences in habitual emotion regulation strategy usage have important relationships to everyday emotional and social experiences in schizophrenia.

AB  - The national Monitoring the Future (MTF) study examines substance use among adolescents and adults in the United States and has used paper questionnaires since it began in 1975. The current experiment tested three conditions as compared to the standard MTF follow-up protocol (i.e., MTF Control) for the first MTF follow-up survey at ages 19/20 years (i.e., one or two years after high school graduation). The MTF Control group included participants who completed in-school baseline surveys in the 12th grade in 2012-2013 and who were selected to participate in the first follow-up survey in 2014 (n = 2,451). A supplementary sample of participants who completed the 12th grade baseline survey in 2012 or 2013 but were not selected to participate in the main MTF follow-up (n = 4,950) were recruited and randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions: (1) Mail Push, (2) Web Push, (3) Web Push + E-mail. Results indicated that the overall response rate was lower in Condition 2 compared to MTF Control and to Condition 1; there were no differences between Condition 3 and other conditions. Web response was highest in Condition 3; among web responders, smartphone response was also highest in Condition 3. Subgroup differences also emerged such that, for example, compared to white participants, Hispanics had greater odds of web (versus paper) response and blacks had greater odds of smartphone (versus computer or tablet) response. Item nonresponse was lowest in the Web Push conditions (compared to MTF Control) and on the web survey (compared to paper). Compared to MTF Control, Condition 3 respondents reported higher rates of alcohol use in the past 30 days. The total cost was lowest for Condition 3. Overall, the Condition 3 Web Push + E-mail design is promising. Future research is needed to continue to examine the implications of web and mobile response in large, national surveys.

AB  - User participation is increasingly being seen as a way to mitigate the challenges that firms face in innovation, such as high costs and uncertainty of customer acceptance of their innovations. Thus, firms are establishing online platforms to support users in innovating services, such as iOS and Android platforms for mobile data service (MDS) innovation. Mobile phone platforms are characterized by technology (toolkits) and policy (rules) components that could influence user's innovation. Additionally, attributes of user innovators (lead userness) are expected to drive their innovation behavior. Yet it is unclear how these characteristics jointly impact users' service innovation outcomes. To address this knowledge gap, we propose a model that builds on user innovation theory and the work design literature to explain the influences of lead userness, design autonomy, toolkit support, and their interactions on user's innovation outcomes (innovation quantity) on these platforms. We conceptualize toolkit support in terms of two constructs (i.e., ease of effort and exploration), and design autonomy in terms of three constructs (i.e., decision-making autonomy, scheduling autonomy, and work-method autonomy). The model was tested using survey and archival data from two dominant mobile phone platforms (i.e., iOS and Android). As hypothesized, lead userness, exploration through toolkits, and ease of effort through toolkits positively affect users' innovation quantity. Additionally, decision-making autonomy and work-method autonomy influence innovation quantity, but scheduling autonomy does not. Further, the proposed three-way interactions between lead userness, toolkit support, and design autonomy constructs on users' quantity of MDS innovation are largely supported. The findings enhance our understanding of user innovation on mobile phone platforms.

AB  - Lifelog is the foundation on which lifelong services and healthcare services are implemented in a smart home system. It also plays a major role in the sub-processes of the system because it acquires information about the home's residents for home automation and entertainment. Providing personalized services to individuals by acquiring and managing this personal lifelog information has great advantages in terms of service satisfaction and effectiveness. In this paper, we implemented a personal search system based on android that collected and stored an individual's lifelog based on nine smart phone sensors and used it to derive new meaningful information about the user. The activity recognition module for classifying the user's behavior, the naive Bayesian method, showed an accuracy of 88.23% and the area under the ROC curve value of 0.941. We designed and implemented density-based spatial clustering method in the module for extracting the point of interest and the participants filled out a satisfaction questionnaire to evaluate the search system. The proposed system efficiently uses a large amount of lifelog data and automates the process of extracting meaningful information, associating it according to the user's intention.

AB  - Streaming media devices have recently become one of the innovative IT devices used to replace traditional smart TV sets. In order to examine user acceptance of streaming media device, this study proposes an extended research model based upon flow theory and investigates the relationship among flow, perceived usefulness, product-related characteristics (i.e., content quality, functionality, ease of use, portability), and a manufacturer-related characteristic (i.e., trust). Partial least square methodology was employed to test the proposed model and corresponding hypotheses on data collected from 305 survey samples. The results showed that flow and perceived usefulness, two mediating variables, has a significant influence on usage intention. Among the four antecedents reflecting product-related attributes, content quality has the strongest effect on flow. Interestingly, functionality and ease of use affected only perceived usefulness in an indirect way through flow. Thus, flow mediates the effect of functionality and ease of use on perceived usefulness. This study discusses a number of implications and offers insights useful for both researchers and practitioners.

AB  - Ubiquitous mobile computing offers innovative approaches in the delivery of information that can facilitate free roaming of the city, informing and guiding the tourist as the city unfolds before them. However making frequent visual reference to mobile devices can be distracting, the user having to interact via a small screen thus disrupting the explorative experience. This research reports on an EU funded project, SpaceBook, that explored the utility of a hands-free, eyes-free virtual tour guide, that could answer questions through a spoken dialogue user interface and notify the user of interesting features in view while guiding the tourist to various destinations. Visibility modelling was carried out in real-time based on a LiDAR sourced digital surface model, fused with a variety of map and crowd sourced datasets (e.g. Ordnance Survey, OpenStreetMap, Flickr, Foursquare) to establish the most interesting landmarks visible from the user's Iodation at any giVen moment. A number of variations of the SpaceBook system were trialled in Edinburgh (Scotland). The research highlighted the pleasure derived from this novel form of interaction and revealed the complexity of prioritising route guidance instruction alongside identification, description and embellishment of landmark information there being a delicate balance between the level of information 'pushed' to the user, and the user's requests for further inforrnation. Among a number of challenges, were issues regarding the fidelity of spatial data and positioning information required for pedestrian based systems - the pedestrian having much greater freedom of movement than vehicles.

AB  - Purpose As an increasing number of users have acquired information across the web and mobile platforms for social question and answering (Q&A), it is of interest to explore whether there are differences in social Q&A usages between the two platforms. The purpose of this paper is to compare web and mobile platforms of a social Q&A service from the user's perspective in terms of three dimensions, namely, demographics, individual-based constructs, and information-based constructs.
   Design/methodology/approach Because Zhihu.com is one of the most popular social Q&A sites in China, the authors used online questionnaires to investigate its users' perceptions of these three dimensions. From January to March 2016, the authors obtained 278 valid responses in total through snowball and convenient sampling. Collected data are analyzed through descriptive statistics and inferential statistics.
   Findings The results indicate that there exist significant differences between web users and mobile users on Zhihu.com in terms of gender, affinity, and information seeking. More specifically, compared to the male users, more female users rely on the mobile platform to access the information service; mobile users perceive higher affinity with Zhihu.com than web users; and mobile users perceive higher information-seeking intention than web users do.
   Originality/value Regarding the theoretical aspect, this study proposes a conceptual framework for comparison between the web and mobile platforms of social Q&A from the user's perspective. Regarding the practical aspect, the comparative results of this study could give social Q&A service providers useful information about users' differences between web and mobile platforms of social Q&A services.

AB  - With the growing popularity of smartphones and tablets, the number of people who use wireless internet, including mobile internet, reached 11 million in 2013. The number of m-commerce services and applications used by customers in Taiwan is still small. This study aims to investigate the factors that predict users' behavioural intention to adopt m-commerce in Taiwan. It is based on the revised Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology model (UTAUT), and two of Hofstede's cultural dimensions (power distance and uncertainty avoidance) as moderators on the UTAUT model to enhance the understanding of influencing users' intention of using m-commerce. The study sample surveyed with online questionnaires consists of 435 valid respondents. The research result shows that effort expectation, performance expectation, social influence and trust significantly influence the behavioural intention to use m-commerce. For moderator effects, power distance has an interacting effect with social influence, and has a negative relationship with social influence on behavioural intention to use m-commerce.

AB  - Mobile learning readiness is a new aspect of technology integration for classroom teachers. Determining the best strategies for successfully implementing mobile devices in order to improve learning is an important topic needing systematic research, because targeted professional development can help ensure effective integration of mobile learning into classroom environments. Teachers must have supportive professional development fostering enthusiasm and willingness as well as skill in techniques for integrating mobile devices successfully in the classroom. In this study the Mobile Learning Readiness Survey (MLRS) scales are confirmed to be aligned with well-established measures of technology integration based on more traditional information technologies. Educators who are higher in technology integration report the greatest benefits from mobile learning, prefer online or blended learning and recognize the importance of external influences on implementation. The four scales of the MLRS generally exhibit the desirable properties of step-wise increases in readiness as teacher competence grows and include a basis for beginning the development of a classification framework to assist in targeting types of professional development.

TI  - The Comparability of Scores from Different Digital Devices: A Literature Review and Synthesis with Recommendations for Practice
T2  - APPLIED MEASUREMENT IN EDUCATION
LA  - English
AB  - Evidence of comparability is generally needed whenever there are variations in the conditions of an assessment administration, including variations introduced by the administration of an assessment on multiple digital devices (e.g., tablet, laptop, desktop). This article is meant to provide a comprehensive examination of issues relevant to the comparability of scores across devices, and as such provide a starting point in designing and implementing a research agenda to support the comparability of any assessment program. This work starts with a conceptual framework rooted in the idea of a comparability claim-a conceptual statement about how each student is expected to perform on each of the devices in question. Then a review of the available literature is provided, focusing on how aspects of the devices (touch screens, keyboards, screen size, and displayed content) and aspects of the assessments (content area and item type) relate to student performance and preference. Building on this literature, recommendations to minimize threats to comparability are then provided. The article concludes with ways to gather evidence to support claims of comparability.

AB  - This study investigates why and which types of college and research libraries (CRLs) are currently developing makerspaces (or an equivalent space) for their communities. Based on an online survey and phone interviews with a sample population of CRLs in New England, I found that 26 CRLs had or were in the process of developing a makerspace in this region. In addition, several other CRLs were actively promoting and diffusing the maker ethos. Of these libraries, most were motivated to promote open access to new technologies, literacies, and STEM-related knowledge.

AB  - Mixed-mode surveys have been around since the late 1980s. In the past thirty years, major changes in technology and society influenced and changed data collection and survey methodology. However, in those years, mixed-mode strategies remained part of the daily survey practice, although the type of mix implemented followed the changes in technology and data collection methods. In this paper, I summarize the state of the art in traditional mixed-mode surveys and discuss implications for mixed device surveys.

AB  - Electronically assisted survey techniques offer several advantages over traditional survey techniques. However, they can also potentially introduce biases, such as coverage biases and measurement error. The current study compares the relative merits of two survey distribution and completion modes: email recruitment with internet completion; and door to door recruitment with either tablet or internet completion. Presentation mode is held constant so that we are able to separate the impacts of recruitment mode and completion mode on responses. Recruitment mode appeared to influence both response rates and which socio-demographic groups were represented. However, the difference between the two recruitment modes was relatively small. Completion mode appeared to have little or no impact on responses although it did influence completion times. The email distributed survey performed better with regard to time costs and the number of respondents obtained. Differences between the two survey modes appeared to be largely due to recruitment method rather than completion mode.

AB  - Residential buildings account for a large proportion of our total energy consumption. Numerous studies have been conducted to assess the impact of different types of energy consumption feedback on customer behavior. However, an eco-feedback delivered on technological devices such as tablet or smartphone can only be effective if it is consulted by customers, and thus has to be well accepted and positively viewed by them. The aim of the present study was to compare levels of a priori acceptability across the most tested types of eco-feedback in the literature, namely informational (single number corresponding to the customer's energy consumption), temporal (allowing customers to compare their levels of consumption over time), normative (indicating customers' consumption relative to other people's mean consumption), temporal and normative (comparisons over time and in relation to other people), interpersonal (ranking of customers) and intergroup (ranking of groups). A priori acceptability of this feedback was assessed with a survey of 176 French people living in a mid-sized metropolitan area. Overall, intentions to use were quite high, even though participants were not in the habit of attending to feedback. Moreover, results revealed that the most acceptable types of feedback were temporal and normative, while intergroup and interpersonal types of feedback were the least acceptable.

AB  - Although the literature has paid a lot of attention to the importance of mobile digital media in shaping people's perception of personal and social time, little empirical research has focused on these issues. We aim at bridging this gap by testing empirically a hypothesis that shared perceptions of social life in the smartphone era vary generationally. The analysis, based on representative survey data collected in Estonia in 2014 (n = 573), revealed three underlying dimensions of the perceptions of smartphone use: (1) Expanding flexibility and diverse opportunities, (2) Vanishing boundaries and foci, and (3) Changing social identity and communication conventions. Generational differences manifested in the case of the first and the second dimension, lending support to the initial hypothesis. In the case of the third dimension, other structural factors, time use and subjective perceptions of personal time, rather than generational differences, explained the variation in the perceptions of smartphone use.

AB  - Despite an emerging trend of location check-ins as a means of mobile communication amongst Facebook users, little attention has been devoted to the value of location check-ins as marketing potential. In particular, little is known about how mobile users process and assess location information shared by their friends on Facebook. Undergirded by persuasion knowledge and elaboration likelihood models, a self-instructed online survey with 255 undergraduate students found that friendship tie strength was positively correlated with students' attitudes towards and perceived credibility of the location information shared by their Facebook friends. However, this relationship was true of those who reported a high level of mobile phone competence rather than those with low mobile phone competence. Prior experience with location sharing on Facebook was also positively correlated with students' evaluations of the location information. Theoretical and practical implications were discussed.

AB  - Despite a nationwide lawful effort to regulate texting-while-driving behavior, little change has been reported. This study assessed the effect of current legal enforcement on attitudinal and behavioral responses toward texting while driving in conjunction with potential influences of two types of perceived norms legal and moral. An online survey was conducted with 313 college students recruited from three states where the history of a banning law of texting while driving varied (more than 3 years, less than 1 year, and none). The students self-reported perceived legal norm, perceived moral norm, perceived risk of texting while driving, frequency of texting while driving, attitude toward texting while driving, and intention of texting while driving. General linear model analyses revealed that the mere presence of legal enforcement showed a negative relationship with frequency of behavior only for the state with the banning law in effect more than 3 years. While the perceived legal norm showed inconsistent relationships with outcome variables, the perceived moral norm appeared most promising to discourage texting while driving among young drivers. A banning law for texting-while-driving behavior not only backfired on the actual behavior in a short-term effect, but also required a long-term exposure of the law to change the actual behavior among college students. On the other hand, cultivation of a moral norm to regulate the behavior of texting while driving is particularly encouraged in that the stable nature of this psychological variable can play a role to suppress possible reactance evoked by an external force. Policy makers are encouraged to harness their approach to regulate young drivers' texting while driving with the strategy that appeals to the drivers' moral beliefs rather than simply forcing them to comply with the law.

AB  - Purpose Building information modeling (BIM) and lean construction are two practices that are developed in order to increase productivity, efficiency and quality in construction by implementing various procedures. However, the practical execution of both BIM and lean is mostly limited with the tasks performed in the office environments in the design phase. The purpose of this paper is to examine the benefit realizations in terms of lean interactions resulting from mobile BIM processes through a framework by focusing on digital transformations performed on the construction site.
   Design/methodology/approach This paper examines the benefit realizations in terms of lean interactions resulting from mobile BIM processes through a framework by focusing on digital transformations performed on the construction site. To describe the case, BIM project management processes during construction phase have been explained by a participatory research. With a comprehensive literature review, interactions between site BIM processes and lean principles have been defined and the case has been evaluated accordingly.
   Findings By focusing on the mobile BIM delivery of project information via tablets to construction site, it has been identified that through the use of technology enabled by BIM practices, lean construction principles are also simultaneously accomplished. This achievement is not only realized with technology but also with the strategic implementation and transformation of organization with the proper BIM practices.
   Research limitations/implications The research is focused on mobile BIM processes applied on-site to enhance traditional project management processes. With the findings of this paper, practitioners may identify research questions to resolve real-life implementation challenges.
   Practical implications This research will enlighten construction practitioners regarding site BIM application capabilities and lean achievements with the utilization of improved project management processes enabled by BIM.
   Originality/value Through the implementation of project management processes enabled by BIM practices on construction site, lean principles are achieved and bottlenecks are identified.

This study examines the setting for communication that includes what is communicated (e.g. positive or negative messages), the nature of the relationship (close versus distant), and the information channel. The respondents to a web-based questionnaire (n=627) were Norwegian smartphone users aged 16-35years. Respondents evaluated mobile communication services that they used in specific social settings by checking off all that apply. Two methods of analysis are used to examine the material. First, a Principal Component Regression validated the main method, namely a mixed model for the Analysis of Variance. Results show the probability of using a mobile communication service is based on the effects of social group, communication purpose, communication channel, and their interaction. The relationship to the interlocutor was found to have the strongest effect on channel choice.

AB  - With the increasing penetration of mobile phones and the internet in India, citizen journalism has experienced a steady growth in recent years. This paper adds to the growing scholarship on citizen journalism by exploring the motivations of Indian citizen journalists to produce online news content. Through a Web-based survey of citizen journalists (N = 134) contributing to the leading news portals in India, this study addresses the role of traditional media experience among citizen journalists' reporting practices. One of the key findings of this study is that, unlike American citizen journalists, Indian citizen journalists who have not worked in traditional media are less likely to work collaboratively than those with traditional media experience.

AB  - We studied the impact of different layouts for rank order questions on respondent effort, data quality, and substantive results among PC and smartphone respondents, in an experiment in an opt-in online panel in Spain, using an order-by-click design. We experimentally varied the device, the number of columns, and, for smartphone respondents, the position of the next' button in questions on trust in institutions.We found some evidence of lower data quality for smartphone users but no evidence that presenting ranking items in one column performs differently than two columns. We also find little evidence that these effects differ by the number of response options presented or the number to be ranked. The placement of the next' button had little effect on performance on ranking items. Overall, our findings suggest that the format and layout of order-by-click questions has little effect on data quality, regardless of device used.

AB  - A secondary analysis of 2010-2014 World Values Survey (WVS) data (N=81,229) is performed across 56 countries to assess frequency of exposure to television news versus the Internet and mobile phone as information sources. A large majority of the comparisons (105/112; 93.75%) reveal television to be used more frequently than Internet or mobile phones (p<1.0E-09). A content analysis of works published in 9 communication journals from 2010 to 2014 indicates a precipitous decline in the attention political communication scholars are giving to television. Meanwhile, there is substantial growth in the focus on new media.

AB  - This study examines teleworkers' job satisfaction related to the use of and satisfaction with a variety of communication channels and workers' personality type. U.S. teleworkers (N = 384) completed an online survey and self-reported on dimensions of communication channel satisfaction, job satisfaction, and personality. Results indicated that extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness are positively correlated with job satisfaction. Additionally, significant moderating effects were found for the relationship between openness and phone and video communication, and agreeableness and phone communication on job satisfaction. Findings from this study yield important practical implications for organizations including suggestions for optimizing communication satisfaction for employees of differing personality types and recommendations to help organizations effectively hire and retain teleworkers.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the level of privacy concern among users of mobile social networking (MSN) apps, and the effect of users' privacy concern on their acceptance of MSN apps. Based on the social exchange theory as well as the uses and gratification theory, we developed a research model to hypothesise the relationships among privacy-related constructs. We tested the research model using the data collected from a survey study. Our data analysis indicates that survey respondents have privacy concern when using MSN apps. However, the direct effect of privacy concern on user's behavioural intention is not statistically significant, while enjoyment has a significant positive influence on the behavioural intention. The antecedents of enjoyment and privacy concern are found to significantly affect their respective dependent variable. The findings help researchers and practitioners better understand the impact of privacy concern on users' acceptance of MSN apps.

AB  - Children are growing up in a digital age with increasing exposure to television and touchscreen devices. We tested whether exposure to screen media is associated with children's early language development. One hundred and thirty-one highly educated caregivers of UK children aged 6-36 months completed a media exposure questionnaire and vocabulary measure. 99% of children were read to daily, 82% watched television, and 49% used mobile touchscreen devices daily. Regression analyses revealed that time spent reading positively predicted vocabulary comprehension and production scores at 6-18 months, but time spent engaging with television or mobile touchscreen devices was not associated with vocabulary scores. Critically, correlations revealed that time spent reading or engaging with other non-screen activities was not offset by time spent engaging with television or mobile touchscreen devices. Thus, there was no evidence to suggest that screen media exposure adversely influenced vocabulary size in our sample of highly educated families with moderate media use.

AB  - This article combines data from the British National Readership Survey, the Audit Bureau of Circulations, and comScore to calculate how much audience attention newspapers' print, personal computer (PC), and mobile platforms attract. The results show that, of the time spent with 11 UK national newspaper brands by their British audiences, 88.5 per cent still comes via their print editions, 7.49 per cent via mobiles, and just 4 per cent via PCs. The study reveals that the share of consumption of UK national newspaper brands (when measured by time spent) is less evenly distributed than commonly understood, conforming better to a logarithmic pattern than a linear one, and that a single brandThe Mailhas close to a 30 per cent market share. Such data should inform debates on, and the regulation of, media plurality. For publishers, this research calls into question the transition from print to online, showing how dead-tree editions are their most important platform. However, the circulation of print editions is in steep decline and newspapers' fortunes are falling almost as steeply. Unless the qualities that make newsprint so much more engaging than online journalism can be harnessed to propel a reading resurgence, newspapers' decline will continue, with important social, cultural, and political consequences.

AB  - In an experiment dealing with the use of personal computer, tablet, or mobile, scale points (up to 5, 7, or 11) and response formats (bars or buttons) are varied to examine differences in mean scores and nonresponse. The total number of not applicable answers does not vary significantly. Personal computer has the lowest item nonresponse, followed by mobile and tablet, and a lower mean score than for mobile. Slider bars showed lower mean scores and more nonresponses than buttons, indicating that they are more prone to bias and difficult in use. Sider bars, which work with a drag-and-drop principle, perform worse than visual analogue scales working with a point-and-click principle and buttons. Five-point scales have more nonresponses than eleven-point scales. Respondents evaluate 11-point scales more positively than shorter scales.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between e-marketing (eM) and consumers' buying behavior particularly exploratory buying behavior tendencies (EBBT) with moderating effect of a gender in the context of China.
   Design/methodology/approach Structural equation modeling using SPSS/AMOS was majorly applied to ascertain the relationship and hypotheses testing. First, the correlation of eM toward EBBT is examined using five factors: internet marketing (IM), e-mail marketing (EMa), intranet marketing (IMa), extranet marketing (EM), and mobile marketing (MM). Second, the relationship of each dimension of the eM model is determined autonomously to ensure the importance of such emerging technologies in marketing communications. Third, the effect of gender as a moderator is measured. To this end, primary data were collected through random distribution of the questionnaires among 1,600 consumers particularly students of the universities between February 2016 and August 2016 within North China.
   Findings The findings revealed that eM has a significant correlation on consumers' EBBT. The comprehensive analysis of each factor of eM, i.e., IM, EMa, IMa, EM, and MM is positively correlated to EBBT. The present study revealed that gender did not moderate among the relationships of eM and EBBT. Additionally, study furnishes practical directions on how managers can utilize such emerging and revolutionary technologies in marketing activities to probe, understand, and reinforce consumers' buying behavior.
   Research limitations/implications The research has limitations related to geographical location and sample size which thus limits the widespread generalization.
   Practical implications This study affirmed that organizations must engage the consumers using such technologies that are more likely acceptable by consumers in the present customer-oriented and digital era. The marketers must engage consumers the way they wish to be engaged by developing appropriate promotional strategies. The study provides possible implications both theoretical and managerial along with a contribution to the literature of eM and consumers' buying behavior.
   Social implications Understanding the emerging technologies may furnish valuable insights for individuals to work well within Chinese SMEs.
   Originality/value The topic of eM has acknowledged as an evolving concept which is gaining an intense concern of both academician and practitioners. Therefore, more research mainly empirical work is still needed to probe the insights of eM across the globe. This study attempts to fulfill such need with empirical evidence together with an in-depth examination of eM determinants, collectively and autonomously.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationships between women entrepreneurs' firm performance and two dimensions (enrichment and interference) of the business-family interface (BFI) in the moderating context of the level of economic development in two emerging countries - Morocco and Turkey. The enrichment perspective was operationalized as family instrumental (financial) and affective (moral) support, while interference was operationalized as gender-related personal problems.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study drew upon the work-family interface (WFI) theory from the family embeddedness perspective in the context of institutional economics. In Morocco, a purposive sample of 116 women entrepreneurs completed a self-administered questionnaire using field collection, mail, and phone surveying methods. In Turkey, 147 women entrepreneurs completed the questionnaire online and through personal contacts in business organizations.
   Findings - The findings indicated a positive relationship of family financial support with business performance of female entrepreneurs in Morocco, a less economically advanced country. However, family moral support is related to better firm performance in Turkey, a more advanced economy. Gender-related personal problems of women entrepreneurs appear to hamper their business performance in Turkey; while in Morocco, the performance of women entrepreneurs seems to improve in the face of such impediments.
   Practical implications - The results provide initial evidence that female entrepreneurs benefit from the linkages of family-to-business enrichment in different ways, depending on the country's level of economic development. In less economically developed countries, women entrepreneurs benefit more from instrumental rather than affective components of the enrichment dimension of the BFI. Conversely, in more economically advanced countries, female entrepreneurs benefit more from affective rather than the instrumental elements of this dimension. Likewise, the components of the interference dimension of the BFI affect female entrepreneurs differently depending on the economic development of the countries. Women in the less-developed country of Morocco are less impeded by their personal problems compared to their counterparts in Turkey, a more developed economy. Actually, Moroccan women entrepreneurs improved their business performance when facing obstacles, most likely due to their increased inner strength and resilience acquired when battling adversarial institutional conditions.
   Originality/value - The present study makes three unique contributions to the entrepreneurship literature. First, the study links the two BFI dimensions (enrichment and interference) to firm performance with an exclusive focus on female business owners. Second, within the construct of enrichment, the study employs both family instrumental and emotional support. Third, the study shows that the country's level of economic development moderates the relationships between the BFI dimensions and firm performance.

AB  - The tremendous growth in interactive music streaming is raising questions about its effects on the music industry. While premium subscriptions offer unconstrained access to music streaming, free services typically offer limited mobility in their usage. If streaming enhances product discovery, and if consumers value mobility, then free streaming could stimulate the use of channels that allow mobile consumption. I exploit the introduction of a listening cap by the platform Deezer to identify the effect of free and mobile-restricted streaming on the music purchasing and piracy behavior of a large set of individuals. Results show that users visited licensed and unlicensed downloading websites around 2% less than they would have had the restriction not been introduced, showing a positive effect of free streaming on these alternative sources of consumption. Results also indicate heterogeneous effects of the restriction, and back of the envelope calculations suggest that the purchasing and piracy activities of lighter streamers are stimulated by free streaming to a larger extent.

AB  - Due to a rising mobile device penetration, Web surveys are increasingly accessed and completed on smartphones or tablets instead of desktop computers or laptops. Mobile Web surveys are also gaining popularity as an alternative self-administered data collection mode among survey researchers. We conducted a methodological experiment among iPhone owners and compared the participation and response behavior of three groups of respondents: iPhone owners who started and completed our survey on a desktop or laptop PC, iPhone owners who self-selected to complete the survey on an iPhone, and iPhone owners who started on a PC but were requested to switch to iPhone. We found that respondents who completed the survey on a PC were more likely to be male, to have a lower educational level, and to have more experience with Web surveys than mobile Web respondents, regardless of whether they used the iPhone voluntarily or were asked to switch from a PC to an iPhone. Overall, iPhone respondents had more missing data and took longer to complete the survey than respondents who answered the questions on a PC, but they also showed less straightlining behavior. There are only minimal device differences on survey answers obtained from PCs and iPhones.

AB  - Internet surveys are cost-effective and convenient, but give respondents the opportunity to search the Web for answers to factual questions. Surprisingly, few have investigated the quality of political knowledge data collected in crowd-sourced Internet samples. Using a novel technique to identify individual "cheaters'' across six data sets-collected on Amazon's Mechanical Turk (professionalized paid "workers'') and Survey-Monkey (less-professionalized unpaid "audiences'')-we find that cheating is pervasive. In addition to detecting "cheaters,'' we also show that their political knowledge is significantly inflated compared with non-cheaters, posing problems for the accurate measurement of knowledge. Fortunately, we also demonstrate that question-wording alterations can significantly improve data quality and show that cheating is less-common on mobile survey-taking platforms (compared with desktop/laptop computers).

AB  - With respondents increasingly completing web surveys on tablet computers and smartphones, several studies have examined the potential effects of the switch from PCs to mobile devices. The studies have looked at a range of outcomes, including completion rates, breakoffs, and item nonresponse. We carried out a field experiment that compared responses obtained by smartphones, tablets, and laptop computers, focusing on the potential effects of the different devices on measurement errors. We examined whether the differences across devices in screen size (and the related need to scroll to see the entire question or the full set of response options) might moderate the effects of response order, affect the strategy respondents used to decide which of two options was preferable, change the effect of question context, or influence the use of definitions. Our experiments were based on the principle of visual prominence-the idea that respondents are more likely to notice and consider information that is easy to see. The experiments were deliberately designed to maximize the impact of screen size on the results, since the screen size would affect the visual prominence of key information. However, like many of the prior studies examining mobile devices, although response order, context, and evaluation strategy affected the answers respondents gave, few device effects emerged.

AB  - Mobile learning readiness is a new aspect of technology integration for classroom teachers. Determining the best strategies for successfully implementing mobile devices in order to improve learning is an important topic needing systematic research, because targeted professional development can help ensure effective integration of mobile learning into classroom environments. Teachers must have supportive professional development fostering enthusiasm and willingness as well as skill in techniques for integrating mobile devices successfully in the classroom. In this study the Mobile Learning Readiness Survey (MLRS) scales are confirmed to be aligned with well-established measures of technology integration based on more traditional information technologies. Educators who are higher in technology integration report the greatest benefits from mobile learning, prefer online or blended learning and recognize the importance of external influences on implementation. The four scales of the MLRS generally exhibit the desirable properties of step-wise increases in readiness as teacher competence grows and include a basis for beginning the development of a classification framework to assist in targeting types of professional development.

AB  - This paper furthers our understanding of online customer support with regard to online live chat systems. Online live chat systems allow customers to seek service related information from an organisation via online-based synchronous media with a human service representative who provides answers through such media. With use of a web-based survey involving 302 respondents of real-life live chat service experiences with mobile phone network providers in the UK and through the use of structural equation modelling, the aim of this research is to understand the variables capable of influencing a customer's satisfaction with their experience during an online live chat service encounter. The results indicate the importance of service quality, information quality and system quality variables influencing satisfaction with the experience, while such influence is dependent on the purpose of use. Additionally, the results outline the role of emoticons, presence of service reps picture, automated 'canned' responses and the presence of response time estimations in moderating the influence of service quality, information quality and system quality variables on satisfaction with the experience.

AB  - Cycling is becoming one of the most popular forms of recreation and transport the world over, but cyclists still have a high level of vulnerability. A bicycle helmet is an important safety device available to cyclists, but little is known regarding possible determinants of helmet use among adults. This study aims at providing information on helmet usage patterns in Italy and identifying the factors associated with bicycle helmet use. Data on 2072 bicycle riders from an Italian friends of cycling association aged 18 years or older who had ridden a bicycle in the last month were collected using an ad-hoc questionnaire via the web. The sample was equally distributed among subjects who always, most of the time, sometimes, rarely, or never use a helmet. To evaluate the association among socio-demographic and bicycle use characteristics and helmet use, a multinomial logistic regression model was performed. The results show a higher propensity to use a helmet among males, riders coming from Central and Southern Italy, people who cycles more than 60 kilometres in a week, cyclists who have already had a crash, people who do not cycle daily or almost daily, riders of sport bikes. Moreover, the propensity to use a helmet increases with age. The survey provided a first step in approaching the lack of data on cycling behaviour and the wearing of a helmet in Italy.

AB  - Smartphone addiction has been related to psychological, behavioral, and social problems, with attachment styles being found to be one of the more prevalent factors. This study explored the relationships between attachment styles and smartphone addiction, and then investigated the mediating roles of dysfunctional attitudes and self-esteem. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted with a voluntary college student sample in China (N = 297) to test the proposed hypotheses. It was found that anxious attachment styles positively predicted smartphone addiction. More importantly, dysfunctional attitudes and self-esteem were found to be mediators between anxious attachment styles and smartphone addiction, as well as close attachment styles and smartphone addiction. Deeper causes and implications are discussed.

AB  - This study examined the factors affecting university students' resistance and intention to use of mobile learning by developing an integrated research model that combines innovation diffusion theory (IDT) and model of innovation resistance (MIR). We added the concepts of inertia and innovativeness to shed light on the personal aspects of students' adoption of mobile learning. Data were collected from a self administered online survey of South Korean university students (N = 493). Structural equation results revealed that relative advantage, complexity, and inertia had significant effects on students' mobile learning resistance, with inertia being the most significant. Relative advantage, innovativeness, and mobile learning resistance had significant effects on students' intention to use mobile learning, with relative advantage being the most significant. Furthermore, mobile learning resistance was found to mediate the effects of relative advantage and complexity on intention to use mobile learning. The results provide valuable implications for researchers and educational practitioners to develop and implement appropriate strategies for mobile learning. 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We examined the relationships between the determinants that affect customers' use of food delivery apps. Using an extended technology acceptance model, we explored consumers' experiences in purchasing delivery food through mobile apps. We distributed a self-administered questionnaire online and used structural equation modeling to test the hypotheses. We found that user-generated information, firm-generated information, and system quality had a significant effect on perceived usefulness. In addition, system quality and design quality strongly influenced the perceived ease of use, which improved perceived usefulness, and in turn, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use affected attitude toward the use of mobile apps. Practical implications for the food service industry are discussed.

AB  - A number of novel problematic behaviors have emerged in the information technology era, and corresponding addictions have been proposed for some of these behaviors. Scholars have speculated that a common factor may underlie these information technology addictions, but this theoretical notion has yet to be tested empirically. The present study tested this notion and also investigated the relationships of information technology addictions with other behavioral addictions as well as substance addictions. We conducted an online survey in 1001 US adults (56% female; mean age = 35.0 years, range =18-83). Two conceptual models were formulated and tested. Moreover, correlations of the information technology addictions with both problematic gambling and alcohol use disorder were examined. The confirmatory factor analysis showed that there was a common factor underlying various types of information technology addiction. In addition, problematic gambling was more strongly correlated with information technology addiction than alcohol use disorder was. Our findings are interpreted in light of a spectrum approach, which conceptualizes information technology addiction as a cluster of disorders comprising not only shared risk factors and symptoms but also distinct characteristics. The findings further reveal that information technology addiction is more similar to other behavioral addictions than substance related addictions. Implications for researchers and practitioners are discussed. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

LA  - English

KW  - Policy
KW  - RLAH
KW  - Roam Like At Home
AB  - As technology evolves and globalization continues, the need for reasonably priced roaming services has never been higher. In 2007, the European Commission (EC) introduced a first set of regulatory decisions to cap the maximal roaming fee end users have to pay for voice services. In the years after, additional price caps have been introduced for SMS and data, initially only for end users, in a later stage also for the wholesale tariff. The final step, Roaming Like at Home (RLAH), will start to take effect in June 2017; from then on end users will pay the same price (for voice, SMS and data) when roaming like in their domestic country.
   The effect of RLAH on the business case of each mobile operator is hard to predict, as the different national markets are extremely heterogeneous and operators face large discrepancies in terms of roaming usage and network costs due to different travelling patterns and various other reasons that cannot be harmonized (geography, economics, working force, usage history, etc.). Furthermore, competition in the telecom market will no longer be a purely national matter, as the decision to abolish roaming tariffs will fully open up cross-border competition.
   This paper aims at providing insights in the effect of RLAH for both the end user as well as the mobile operators. Following a literature survey approach, including an overview of the roaming regulation process from 2007 up to now, the paper discusses possible effects the RLAH initiative might trigger, going from lower wholesale prices for mobile operators to higher retail prices for end Users. Additionally, as the European Commission strives for a digital single market, this paper presents a number of technical solutions (carrier portability, software-based SIMs, cross-border IMSI, Roaming like a Local, Wi-Fi offloading) that may pose a - partial or full - alternative for roaming and explains how these may impact cross-border competition both positively and negatively. The solutions are assessed against two axes: (1) generating the best possible outcome for the end customers (in all countries) and (2) ensuring the best level playing field for (virtual) mobile operators in Europe, which will of course involve trade-offs on different levels.

AB  - Objective: This pilot study explored the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a therapist-facilitated telecare cognitive behavioural anxiety program delivered through schools to children within rural communities. Method: Sixteen children aged 9-12 years (82.5% male), with a principal diagnosis of an anxiety disorder, and their mothers participated in the pilot study. The treatment program was an adaption of the Cool Kids Child and Adolescent Anxiety Management Program. Treatment was delivered by clinical psychologists and involved 10 weekly sessions with children via an interactive, real-time videoconferencing online platform at their school. Parents also received 4 phone calls during the treatment program. Outcome measures included clinician-rated diagnostic status and child- and parent-reported symptoms and interference. Results: According to combined parent and child reports, 62.5% of children no longer met diagnostic criteria for their primary anxiety disorder, and 31.25% did not meet diagnostic criteria for any anxiety disorder post-treatment. Results indicated that the severity of anxiety symptoms, functional impact of anxiety symptoms, externalising difficulties, and depressive symptoms in children decreased significantly post-treatment, as reported by both parents and children. Conclusions: A telecare model of therapy could be a feasible and effective way of delivering evidence-based intervention to children in rural communities.

AB  - In this paper, I argue for a need to expand our understanding of the role that self-help plays in the constitution of identities. Using the example of the Third Culture Kid (TCK) industry, I argue that self-help acts as a space of biopower through its role in managing the emotional experience of having been globally mobile as a child. To do this, the paper looks at how the TCK, as a subject, is surfaced as comfort in relation to the ascribed grief and insecurity of identity that is associated with childhood global mobility. Data are derived from a multi- sited ethnography, including a narrative analysis of TCK literature, reader discussions, participant observation at a TCK event and an online survey. The argument contributes to scholarly critiques of self-help by examining processes of production and consumption of TCK subjectivity enacted through the TCK industry. Thereby, the paper contends that in researching self-help we need a wider understanding of its production and consumption, how people are persuaded to use it, and how they respond to ideas presented within it.

AB  - Smartphone cameras are increasingly used for document capture in daily life. To understand user behaviors, we performed two studies: (1) an online survey (n=106) to understand general smartphone camera usage behaviors related to information capture, as well as participants' experiences of orientation errors, and (2) a controlled lab study (n=16) to understand detailed document capture behaviors and to identify patterns in orientation errors. According to our online survey, 79.30% of the respondents reported experiencing orientation errors during document capture. In addition, our lab study showed that more than 90% of landscape capture tasks result in incorrect orientation. To solve this problem, we systematically analyzed the user behavior during document capture (e.g., video sequences and photographs taken or hand grip used) and propose a novel solution called ScanShot, which detects document capture time to help users correct orientation errors. ScanShot tracks the direction of gravity during document capture and monitors the users rotational or tilting movements of to update changes in orientation automatically. Our results confirm that document capture with 93.44% accuracy; in addition, our orientation update mechanism can reduce orientation errors by 92.85% using a gyroscope (for rotation) and 81.60% using an accelerometer (for micro-tilts).

AB  - The development of web surveys has been accompanied by the emergence of new scales, taking advantages of the visual and interactive features provided by the Internet like drop-down menus, sliders, drag-and-drop, or order-by-click scales. This article focuses on the order-by-click scales, studying the comparability of the data obtained for this scale when answered through PCs versus smartphones. I used data from an experiment where panelists from the Netquest opt-in panel in Spain were randomly assigned to a PC, smartphone optimized, or smartphone not-optimized version of the same questionnaire in two waves. I found significant differences due to the device and optimization at least for some indicators and questions.

AB  - The increasing popularity of text-based computer mediated communication, such as instant messaging and mobile texting, have resulted in the emergence of a new pictographic form of language, i.e. emoji, offering an intuitive and informal way to convey emotions and attitudes, replacing words or phrases in text messages. Based on these characteristics, could identification with emoji be associated with personality? Could they be used instead of text-based items in personality assessment? The present study aimed at exploring these questions. The sample is composed of 234 young adults recruited online (age: M = 24.79, SD = 6.47; 62% female). Participants responded to a brief Big-Five personality questionnaire and a 91-item survey assessing participants' degree of self-identification with emoji selected from the Apple Color Emoji fontset. Results indicated that 36 out of 91 examined emoji are significantly related with three of the Big-Five personality traits - emotional stability, extraversion, and agreeableness - that are consistently linked with emotion and affective processing. Emoji-based measures of these personality traits show moderate-to-large concurrent validity with scores from a validated personality questionnaire (r = 0.6-0.8). Overall, our study advances the idea that emoji might be employed to develop a language-free assessment tool for personality. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article investigates whether Twitter use motivations relate to exposure to discordant information. To this end, this research conducted an online survey of 1,350 adults of South Korea. The results reveal that using Twitter for information-seeking, public-expression, and leisure-seeking purposes helps users to encounter crosscutting exposure, while the use of Twitter for private expression does not. Offline network diversity has a significant association with crosscutting exposure, and it moderates the relationship between Twitter use for public expression or leisure seeking and crosscutting exposure. The positive association between Twitter use for leisure seeking and crosscutting exposure is stronger among younger people than among older people.

AB  - The use of emoticons, particularly on smart mobile devices, has become increasingly popular among young people in recent years. The emoticon is not just a form of information transmission; it also represents a new way of life and a new trend among young people. The aim of this study was to understand the role of emoticons in the daily lives of Chinese young people, investigate how mediated communication has been improved by smart mobile devices and discover users' preferred types of emoticon. First, a review of the literature on emoticons was conducted to explore the relationship between the evolution of the emoticon and young people's everyday lives. Next, in-depth interviews were conducted, which yielded novel findings regarding emoticon use. Finally, a questionnaire was used to obtain data on emoticon use for statistical analysis. The findings revealed four key dimensions of emoticon use that were relevant to the research questions: accuracy, sociability, efficiency and enjoyment. These four dimensions help us to better understand the development of emoticons and their influence on the lifestyles of young people. The findings are expected to provide inspiration and suggest directions for improving the design of smart communication.

AB  - Surveys completed on mobile web devices (smartphones) have been found to take longer than surveys completed on a PC. This has been found both in surveys where respondents can choose which device they use and in surveys where respondents are randomly assigned to devices. A number of potential explanations have been offered for these findings, including (1) slower transmission over cellular or Wi-Fi networks, (2) the difficulty of reading questions and selecting responses on a small device, and (3) the increased mobility of mobile web users who have more distractions while answering web surveys. In a secondary analysis of student surveys, we find that only about one-fifth of the time difference can be accounted for by transmission time (between-page time) with the balance being within-page time differences. Using multilevel models, we explore possible page-level (question-level) and respondent-level factors that may contribute to the time difference. We find that much of the time difference can be accounted for by the additional scrolling required on mobile devices, especially for grid questions.

AB  - The under-reporting of public safety incidents is a long-standing issue. In this paper, we propose a computational cognitive modeling approach to understand and design a mobile crowdsourcing system for improving campus safety reporting. In particular, we adopt drift-diffusion models (DDMs) from cognitive psychology to investigate the effect of various factors on users' reporting tendency for public safety. Our lab experiment and online study show consistent results on how location context impacts people's reporting decisions. This finding informs the design of a novel location-based nudge mechanism, which is tested in another lab experiment with 84 participants and proved to be effective in changing users' reporting decisions. Our follow-up interview study further suggests that the influence of people's mobility patterns (e.g., expected walking distance) could explain why the nudge design is effective. Our work not only informs the design of mobile crowdsourcing for public safety reporting but also demonstrates the value of applying a computational cognitive modeling approach to address HCI research questions more broadly.

AB  - A number of papers have surveyed mobile crowdsourcing systems and, to a lesser extent, situated crowdsourcing systems. These surveys have either contributed a comprehensive taxonomy of the diverse application domains where the systems have tapped into or have characterized different components of the system platforms. In this paper, we present a survey of mobile and situated crowdsourcing systems by addressing fundamental questions about user contributions that system designers pose when building new systems or evaluating existing ones. We select and analyze 40 mobile and situated crowdsourcing systems for which prototypes were deployed and studied in the real world. Inspired by the MIT's genetic model of collective intelligence, we propose our genetic model and new genes for mobile and situated crowdsourcing systems by examining user contributions to the selected systems. We present the observed patterns of different genes and discuss how the model can be used to create new applications and design ideas. By reviewing the existing design principles of online communities, we also provide examples to illustrate how unique genes inspire new design suggestions for encouraging user contributions in the context of mobile and situated crowdsourcing.

AB  - This paper seeks to provide new empirical evidence that demonstrates the importance of digital technologies in promoting economic growth, drawing on the literature on advances in growth and leveraging a broader and more robust country-level panel dataset. In particular, this paper estimates the long-run economic impact of digital technologies using mobile phone penetration and internet usage as broad indicators. The empirical results suggest that, between 2004 and 2014, the diffusion of digital technologies significantly improved economic output in Australia and abroad, contributing to steady-state gross domestic product per capita growth of approximately 5.8 per cent on average. These findings could serve as the starting-point for predictions about the likely impact of future technologies, providing a better understanding for policy-makers in prioritising initiatives that will continue to lift living standards in the coming years.

AB  - The number of respondents who access web surveys on a mobile device (smartphone or tablet) has been increasing rapidly over the last few years. Compared with desktop computers, mobile devices have smaller screens, different input options, and are used in a larger variety of locations and situations. The suspicion that the quality of data may suffer when online respondents use mobile devices has stimulated a growing body of research, which has mainly focused on paradata and web survey design. To investigate whether the respondents' device affects the quality of web survey data, we examined the responses of 1,826 mobile-device and desktop participants in a political online survey that asked questions about the 2013 German federal election. To determine the reliability and validity of data submitted via mobile devices, we determined the consistency of the participants' responses across questions and validated the responses against various internal and external criteria. Replicating previous findings, mobile-device respondents were younger and more likely to be female, and they produced higher dropout rates and longer completion times than desktop respondents. However, data produced by respondents using mobile devices were as consistent, reliable, and valid as data produced by respondents using desktop computers. These findings contradict the notion that mobile-device users compromise the reliability and validity of data collected online and suggest that researchers do not necessarily need to be afraid of the participation of mobile-device respondents in web surveys.

AB  - Background: Routine monitoring of depression symptoms and suicide risk is essential for appropriate treatment planning and risk management, but not well implemented by clinicians. We developed a brief online monitoring tool to address this issue. Aims: To investigate whether the online tool can feasibly improve monitoring; whether it is acceptable and useful for young people and their clinicians; and to determine whether a shorter tool could be implemented. Method: In a naturalistic longitudinal cohort study, 101 young people with depression completed the online tool on a tablet, prior to their consultation. Their results were immediately available to their clinician. Clients and clinicians answered questionnaires about acceptability and usefulness. Results: The tool was feasible to implement. Young people and clinicians found the tool acceptable and useful for understanding symptoms and risk. A brief three-item suicidal ideation screening measure correlated well with a validated measure of suicidal ideation. Conclusion: The online tool facilitates the quick exchange of key information about suicide risk, allowing clinicians to immediately address this. This level of responsiveness is likely to improve treatment outcomes. The brief version allows full integration into clinical practice to support clinicians managing those at risk of suicide.

AB  - Because numerous barriers hinder the assessment and management of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in clinical practice, the Carevive Care Planning System, a novel Web-based platform, was developed to address these barriers. It provides patients an opportunity to report their symptoms before their clinic visit and generates customizable care plans composed of evidence-basedmanagement strategies. The purpose of this study was to evaluate patient and provider perspectives of feasibility, usability, acceptability, and satisfaction with the Carevive platform. We used a single-arm, pretest/posttest, prospective design and recruited 25 women with breast cancer who were receiving neurotoxic chemotherapy and six advanced practice providers from an academic hospital. At three consecutive clinical visits, patients reported their neuropathy symptoms on a tablet via the Carevive system. The Diffusion of Innovations Theory served as an overarching evaluation framework. The Carevive platform was feasible to use. However, patients had higher ratings of usability, acceptability, and satisfaction with the platform than did the providers, who disliked the amount of time required to use the platform and had difficulty logging into Carevive. If issues regarding provider dissatisfaction can be addressed, the Carevive platform may aid in the screening of neuropathy symptoms and facilitate the use of evidence-based management strategies.

AB  - Developmental dysgraphia, being observed among 10-30% of school-aged children, is a disturbance or difficulty in the production of written language that has to do with the mechanics of writing. The objective of this study is to propose a method that can be used for automated diagnosis of this disorder, as well as for estimation of difficulty level as determined by the handwriting proficiency screening questionnaire. We used a digitizing tablet to acquire handwriting and consequently employed a complex parameterization in order to quantify its kinematic aspects and hidden complexities. We also introduced a simple intrawriter normalization that increased dysgraphia discrimination and HPSQ estimation accuracies. Using a random forest classifier, we reached 96% sensitivity and specificity, while in the case of automated rating by the HPSQ total score, we reached 10% estimation error. This study proves that digital parameterization of pressure and altitude/tilt patterns in children with dysgraphia can be used for preliminary diagnosis of this writing disorder.

AB  - Recently a number of studies appeared that operationalised coolness and explored its relation to digital products. Literature suggests that perceived coolness is another factor of user experience, and this adds to an existing explosion of dimensions related to aesthetics, hedonic quality, pragmatic quality, attractiveness, etc. A critical challenge highlighted in prior research is to study the relationships among those factors and so far, no studies have empirically examined the relationship between coolness and other established user experience factors. In this paper, we address this challenge by presenting two studies one that focuses on factors from two cool questionnaires, and one that compares them against existing User eXperience (UX) factors. Our findings show that factors from the two cool questionnaires converge and they also converge to existing, established UX factors. Thus, 11 distinct cool and UX factors converge into 5 for the case of mobile devices. Our findings are important for researchers, as we demonstrate through a validated model that coolness is part of UX research, as well as for practitioners, by developing a questionnaire that can reliably measure both perceived inner and outer coolness as well as the overall coolness judgement based on 5 factors and 21 items.

AB  - Recent advances in mobile technology offer new directions for augmentative and alternative communication (AAC); however, it remains unclear whether they meet the needs of individuals with aphasia. This paper reports on research seeking to understand this changing landscape. A Web-based survey of aphasia-oriented clinicians helped illuminate device adoption trends. Observations of group therapy sessions featuring high-tech AAC use and focus groups with the clinicians from those sessions provided further nuance and insight into usage and adoption. It was shown that "smart" mobile devices are garnering acceptance as a promising platform for high-tech AAC; however, contrary to the authors' expectations, these devices are not being paired with mobile versions of traditional picture dictionaries. Rather, clinicians reported appropriating generic applications to complement other (non-high-tech) communication strategies, suggesting new opportunities for design.

AB  - This article introduces a transliteracies framework to conceptually account for the contingency and instability of literacy practices on the move and to offer a set of methodological tools for investigating these mobilities. Taking the paradox of mobility-the simultaneous restricting or regulation of movement that accompanies mobility-as its central dialectic, a transliteracies framework functions as a flexible heuristic for attending to how meaning making and power are intertwined in and distributed across social and material relationships. We argue that a transliteracies framework encompasses two primary dimensions of mobile literacy practices: (a) the everyday activity of creating, maintaining, and disassembling associations across movements of people and things (indicated by the prefix trans-) and (b) the dynamic and material nature of meaning making in activity (indicated by the plural root word literacies). To trace the emergent and consequential ways mobilities are managed within and across systems, we introduce four analytical tools for inquiry: emergence, uptake, resonance, and scale. These inquiry tools address the paradox of mobility by highlighting the systemic dimensions of practice that create and perpetuate inequities. We argue that these transliteracies tools facilitate an inquiry stance that positions researchers to attend to people's emic meaning- making processes, work to balance multiple perspectives, account for privilege and position, question normative assumptions and beliefs, and engage in and value multiple ways of knowing.

AB  - Cloud storage services have been rapidly gaining popularity among Internet/Mobile users. Prior studies largely focused on users' early adoption of cloud storage services, continual usage of the services and users' willingness to pay. However, limited attention has been paid to switching behaviors. In the Chinese market, as services provided by different platforms become homogeneous, non-functional factors are expected to play an important role in affecting users' selection of services. Based on the push-pull mooring framework, we propose a research model by incorporating four factors: risk, trust, switching cost and social influences (critical mass and social norm). Results from a field survey suggest that all push (risk), pull (trust, critical mass) and mooring (switching cost, social norm) factors each have direct impacts on switching intention. Mooring factors fail to moderate the impact of push factor on switching intention, but they are able to moderate the effects of pull factors on switching intention. The results yield both theoretical and practical implications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many transit agencies invest substantial resources in surveying their passengers to generate data used for planning, marketing, and equity analyses. Within the industry, there is considerable interest in replacing traditional paper-based self-complete surveys with new approaches that might lower costs or generate better quality data. However, very limited research has been done to identify the relative performance of different transit passenger survey modes. This paper begins to fill that gap.
   The research investigates the relative data quality for three different bus passenger survey methods distributed or administered on the transit vehicle: self-complete paper surveys, interviewer-assisted tablet based surveys, and self-complete online surveys. The research used an experimental design, with the same survey questionnaire distributed via the three survey modes. All factors about the survey and distribution process were kept identical to the extent feasible, so that the only variation would be the survey mode itself.
   The findings by survey mode are compared in terms of the overall response and completion rates, the completion rate for individual questions, respondent demographics, and labor costs per complete. The study results suggest that many agencies may still find the old-fashioned, low-tech paper survey to be the best option for bus passenger surveys. The paper mode required less labor per complete, and for many of the metrics discussed it generated data that was as good as or better than the tablet survey. In addition, the findings suggest that online survey invitations distributed on the transit vehicle are not a good option because they were labor intensive and had very low response rates.

AB  - Depression occurring during pregnancy and postpartum (i.e., the perinatal period) is common and associated with adverse outcomes for women and their offspring. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) has been shown to reduce risk for depressive relapse among at-risk individuals generally, and recent adaptations document the efficacy of MBCT among perinatal women specifically. In addition, MBCT, when delivered using a web-based format (Mindful Mood Balance [MMB] program), has demonstrated acceptability and feasibility for at-risk individuals generally. The aim of the present open trial study was to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary outcomes of IVIMB for use with pregnant women at risk for depressive relapse (N = 37). We predicted that MMB would be feasible and acceptable as assessed by session completion and participation in phone coaching calls, home practice completion, and self-reported satisfaction via questionnaire and interview. We also predicted that women would not demonstrate significant worsening of depression symptom severity during MMB, consistent with our focus on prevention. A brief case example based on a composite of participants is presented to illustrate the MMB structure and content and the phone coaching protocol. Participants demonstrated engagement with the program, reported perceiving benefits in the intended depression prevention targets of MMB, and sustained minimal to mild depressive symptom severity over the course of the program. Given these promising results and the potential benefits of averting depression for women and their families, further development and rigorous testing of MMB among at-risk pregnant women is warranted.

AB  - Objectives: Previous research suggests that anticipation of incoming phone calls or messages and impulsivity are significantly associated with motor vehicle crash. We took a more explanative approach to investigate a conceptual model regarding the direct and indirect effect of compulsive cell phone use and impulsive personality traits on crash risk.
   Methods: We recruited a sample of 307 undergraduate college students to complete an online survey that included measures of cell phone use, impulsivity, and history of motor vehicle crash. Using a structural equation model, we examined the direct and indirect relationships between factors of the Cell Phone Overuse Scale-Il (CPOS-II), impulsivity, in-vehicle phone use, and severity and frequency of previous motor vehicle crash. Self-reported miles driven per week and year in college were included as covariates in the model.
   Results: Our findings suggest that anticipation of incoming communication has a direct association with greater in-vehicle phone use, but was not directly or indirectly associated with increasing risk of previous motor vehicle crash. Of the three latent factors comprising the CPOS-II, Only anticipation was significantly associated with elevated cell phone use while driving. Greater impulsivity and use of in-vehicle cell phone use while driving were directly and significantly associated with greater risk of motor vehicle crash.
   Conclusions: Anticipation of incoming cellular contacts (calls or texts) is associated with greater in-vehicle phone use, while greater in-vehicle cell phone use and impulsive traits are associated with elevated risk of motor vehicle crashes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study examines whether self-perceived popularity, need for popularity, and peer pressure explain teenagers' use of the mobile phone to make and distribute hurtful pictures and videos of peers and teachers. A large-scale quantitative survey study among 1787 Flemish high school pupils in 2010 revealed that, in the six months prior to the study, 25% of adolescents had made a picture/video of a peer who was being ridiculed, 8% of a peer who was being physically bullied, and 11% had distributed such a picture/video online. Thirteen percent had made a picture/video of a teacher being ridiculed, and 6% had distributed such content online. Self-perceived popularity, need for popularity, and perceived peer pressure positively predicted adolescents' involvement in several of the above practices. The results suggest that greater investments need to be made to counter the social rewards that adolescents receive when engaging in these bullying practices.

AB  - Survey participants are increasingly responding to Web surveys on their smartphones as opposed to their personal computers (PCs), and this change brings with it some potential data-quality issues. This study reports on a randomized crossover experiment to compare the effect of two different devices, smartphones and PCs, on response quality in a Web survey conducted in a probability-based panel. Participants (n = 1,390) were invited to complete an online questionnaire on both a smartphone (mobile Web) and PC (PC Web) in sequence. We hypothesized that smartphone use would result in lower-quality responses because people are more likely to use smartphones while multitasking or while around other people and because they could have difficulty recording their answers using a small touchscreen. While we found that respondents who participated in this study were more likely to multitask and more likely to be around other people when using smartphones, these factors had little impact on data quality. Respondents were at least as likely to provide conscientious and thoughtful answers and to disclose sensitive information on smartphones as on PCs. When using smartphones, however, respondents seemed to have trouble accurately moving a small-sized slider handle and a date-picker wheel to the intended values. Overall, we find that people using smartphones can provide high-quality responses, even when their context is more distracting, as long as they are presented with question formats that are easy to use on small touchscreens.

AB  - Given the importance of survey measures of online media use for communication research, it is crucial to assess and improve their quality, in particular because the increasingly fragmented and ubiquitous usage of internet complicates the accuracy of self-reported measures. This study contributes to the discussion regarding the accuracy of self-reported internet use by presenting relevant factors potentially affecting biases of self-reports and testing survey design strategies to improve accuracy. Combining automatic tracking data and survey data from the same participants (N = 690) confirmed low levels of accuracy and tendencies of over-reporting. The analysis revealed biases due to a range of factors associated with the intensity of (actual) internet usage, propensity to multitask, day of reference, and the usage of mobile devices. An anchoring technique could not be proved to reduce inaccuracies of reporting behavior. Several recommendations for research practice follow from these findings.

CP  - 7th International Conference on Are We there Yet Where Technological Innovation is Leading Research
KW  - DESIGN
AB  - This paper explores strategies on how to best balance expanding survey length with the need for concise, relevant and engaging surveys, deployed in a device agnostic format. When designing a survey we, as an industry, are often seeking a balance between competing design challenges: clients have diverse and extensive objectives, survey participants have short attention spans and an ever increasing suite of connected devices to choose from. Survey participants are voting with their feet when surveys are not compatible with the device they want to use, whether that is the smart device in their pocket or laptop they are working on, and this is very real for online panels. We are seeing increased abandon rates, with the effects of extended fieldwork times, smaller pools of sample to draw from and the possibility of introducing bias into our data. Having spent much of 2015 working with clients to design more smart-device friendly surveys, Research Now has explored innovative ways to shorten survey length without compromising on the amount of material covered. Following on from work by Johnson et al. (2014), Research Now conducted a piece of primary research exploring survey modularisation as discussed in the current paper. The approach splits questionnaires into modules, with participants receiving only a specific module, a subset of the overall survey. It is expected that a long questionnaire can be split and when applied appropriately, designed properly and implemented effectively data can yield results comparable with a full non-modular survey. Building on previous industry work on this topic, and primary research conducted by Research Now, we discuss our methodology, the results and conclusions from this work, and explore opportunities to automate the approach. The overall goal of this study and resulting paper is to explore how adapting survey research in this way improves rather than complicates the lives of both researchers and research participants. If we are not able to shorten our surveys, then survey modularisation may prove to be our best hope for a complete, representative dataset and we need to ensure that this is achieved accurately, confidently and efficiently at scale.

AB  - This study investigates whether it is the case that representativity is undermined if personal computer, tablet and smartphone respondents differ in sociodemographic characteristics and display different survey completion rates. Online market research is struggling with sample representativity. The analysis of more than ten million survey invitations, as well as stated device preference information, suggests that web survey respondents who are members of online panels still mostly use their personal computers, but do express increasing interest in using smartphones and tablets. Survey completion rates do vary across devices, and device use is significantly associated with socio-demographic characteristics and length of membership on a panel. Therefore, researchers must not limit respondents to use a specific device for completing a survey as this may compromise the quality of the survey completion experience, increase non response error and negatively affect representativity.

AB  - Now that people on mobile devices can easily choose their mode of communication (e.g., voice, text, video), survey designers can potentially allow respondents to answer questions in whatever mode they find momentarily convenient given their circumstances or that they chronically prefer. We conducted an experiment to explore how mode choice affects response quality, participation, and satisfaction in smartphone interviews. A total of 1,260 iPhone users were contacted on their iPhones by either a human or an automated interviewer via voice or SMS text. This created four modes: Human Voice, Human Text, Automated Voice, and Automated Text. In half of the initial contacts, respondents were required to choose their interview mode (which could be the contact mode); in the remaining half, the mode was simply assigned. Respondents who chose their interview modes provided more conscientious (fewer rounded and non-differentiated) answers, and they reported greater satisfaction with the interview. Although fewer respondents started the interview when given a choice of mode, a higher percentage of Mode Choice respondents who started the interview completed it. For certain mode transitions (e.g., from automated interview modes), there was no reduction in participation. The results demonstrate clear benefits and relatively few drawbacks resulting from mode choice, at least among these modes and with this sample of iPhone users, suggesting that further exploration of mode choice and the logistics of its implementation is warranted.

AB  - In a digital society, we are frequently invited to communicate our present affective state via interfaces. These include smart-phone apps which allow users to track their mood in 'real-time', plus touchpads in organisations and public spaces which seek rapid feedback on whether an experience is positive or negative. In contrast to the use of surveys as tools of valuation, these technologies seek to capture experience in 'real-time', which can then be viewed and evaluated critically at a later time. Based on study of a number of mood-monitoring technologies, this paper highlights some of the ways in which they challenge conventional accounts of (e) valuation. In particular, rather than inviting individuals to represent their feelings towards the past numerically, they invite them to make uncritical expressions of positive or negative mood in the present. The central question of value is no longer how much is something valued, but whether or not it is valued. Quantitative and calculated analysis of positive and negative emotions occurs subsequently.

AB  - The definition of what it means to take a test online continues to evolve with the inclusion of a broader range of item types and a wide array of devices used by students to access test content. To assure the validity and reliability of test scores for all students, device comparability research should be conducted to evaluate the impact of testing device on student test performance. The current study looked at the comparability of test scores across tablets and computers for high school students in three commonly assessed content areas and for a variety of different item types. Results indicate no statistically significant differences across device type for any content area or item type. Student survey results suggest that students may have a preference for taking tests on devices with which they have more experience, but that even limited exposure to tablets in this study increased positive responses for testing on tablets.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of perceived benefits, i.e. utilitarian value, hedonic value and social value, as well as perceived risk, on purchase intention in social commerce context.
   Design/methodology/approach - To cast light on the factors motivating users' intention to purchase in the context of social commerce, data of 277 users of social commerce in China were collected via an online survey.
   Findings - Results show that satisfaction significantly and positively affects users' purchase intention in social commerce context. In addition, utilitarian, hedonic and social values have significant and positive impacts on satisfaction and purchase intention; and utilitarian value is found to be the most salient factor influencing purchase intention, while hedonic value has the greatest effect on satisfaction. Moreover, perceived risk significantly and negatively affects satisfaction.
   Originality/value - Extant research on social commerce has mainly focused on investigating how the general perceived value affects user behavior, but has less considered different dimensions of perceived value. Moreover, prior studies have explored the roles of utilitarian and hedonic values on user behavior; however, there is a lack of research on the effect of social value. The current study attempts to fill these research gaps.

AB  - The aim was to examine whether texting on a mobile phone is a risk factor for musculoskeletal disorders in the neck and upper extremities in a population of young adults.
   In a longitudinal population-based cohort study with Swedish young adults (aged 20-24 years) data were collected via a web-based questionnaire at baseline (n = 7092) and after one and five years. Cross-sectional associations were found between text messaging and reported ongoing symptoms in neck and upper extremities (odds ratios, ORs 1.3-2.0). Among symptom-free at baseline prospective associations were only found between text messaging and new cases of reported symptoms in the hand/fingers (OR 2.0) at one year follow up. Among those with symptoms at baseline prospective associations were found between text messaging and maintained pain in neck/upper back (OR 1.6). The results imply mostly short-term effects, and to a lesser extent, long-term effects on musculoskeletal disorders in neck and upper extremities. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Smartphones have become ubiquitous in people's lives to an extent that necessitates the investigation of their negative impact. The scarcity of such investigations triggered our interest in examining the relationships among smartphone addiction, anxiety, and family relations. A total of 381 university students participated in an online survey composed of demographic information, the Smartphone Addiction Scale - Short Version, and the Beck Anxiety Inventory. Binary logistic regression analysis and structural equation modelling showed that undergraduate students who had smartphone addiction demonstrated greater odds of having high anxiety compared to those who were not addicted, and students who had high anxiety exhibited greater odds of having clinically significant problems in their family relations. Nevertheless, path analysis showed that anxiety mediated a positive relationship between smartphone addiction and problematic family relations.

AB  - Purpose - Although the use of e-book readers has become increasingly widespread, there are few studies to evaluate e-book user behavior and satisfaction with commercial e-book stores, and even fewer approaches from the perspective of task-technology fit (TTF). In order to fill this gap, the purpose of this paper is to adopt the TTF theory to explore the factors that affect the behavior satisfaction of users of commercial e-book stores.
   Design/methodology/approach - A survey was conducted to collect data from 183 e-book users. Data were collected from an online survey. The results were analyzed via the structural equation model.
   Findings - The results show that functional service, mobility, convenience, and searching task are the important factors that influence users' TTF behavior. Moreover, TTF may improve user satisfaction, flow, and scanpath. Finally, satisfaction was affected by TTF, scanpath, and flow factors. An analysis of the research explained 46 percent of the variance for the users' TTF, and 59 percent of the variance for satisfaction of using the e-book store.
   Originality/value - The research model modifies utility and performance from TTF theory in order to focus on individual flow, scanpath, and user satisfaction measurement because general e-book store users are not typically concerned about work performance issues for their leisure activities. These results provide a new perspective to e-book researchers and can help e-book store managers and designers in making policies and designing platforms.

AB  - The current study examines cyberbullying and victimization among African American college students who spend large amounts of time on the Internet and using their smartphones. In a survey of 321 African American college students, the most common venues for victimization occurred through text messages, phone calls, and social networking sites. Posting indiscreet images and sharing personal information with a large number of Facebook friends were positively associated with the victimization. Cyberbullying perpetration, as measured by Cyberbullying Questionnaire (CBQ), revealed a significant gender difference, with male students exhibiting higher prevalence. In a multiple regression analysis, the phenomenon of online disinhibitiona lessening of inhibitions during online interactions that would otherwise be present in face-to-face interactionsemerged as the strongest predictor of cyberbullying perpetration. Recommendations for future research include studying the negative impact of cyberbullying among African American adults, particularly in the workplace.

AB  - Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) programs permit employees to use personal devices to access organizational information. Users gain convenience, while employers benefit from increased productivity and reduced IT expense. Security boundaries must extend to personal devices to mitigate data exfiltration, thereby infringing on employees' privacy by monitoring their personal devices. These monitoring mechanisms play a critical role in employee participation in a BYOD program. Our results demonstrate that the BYOD monitoring mechanisms and privacy concerns suppress the benefits of increased job performance expectancy when evaluating whether to participate in a BYOD program. This research identifies that tasks measured, frequency of monitoring, and organizational control are significant impediments to behavioral intention for BYOD participation.

AB  - Pedestrian crashes are an important issue globally as pedestrians are a highly vulnerable road user group, accounting for approximately 35% of road deaths worldwide each year. In highly motorised countries, pedestrian distraction by hand held technological devices appears to be an increasing factor in such crashes. An online survey (N = 363) was conducted to 1) obtain prevalence information regarding the extent to which people cross the road while simultaneously using mobile phones for potentially distracting activities; 2) identify whether younger adult pedestrians are more exposed to/at risk of injury due to this cause than older adults; and 3) explore whether the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) might provide insight into the factors influencing the target behaviours. Self-reported frequency of using a smart phone for three levels of distraction (visual and cognitive-texting/internet; cognitive only- voice calls; audio only-listening to music) while crossing the road was collected. Results indicated that about 20% of the sample had high exposure to smart phone use while crossing, especially 18-30 year olds who were significantly more likely than other age groups to report frequent exposure. TPB constructs of Attitude, Subjective Norm, and Perceived Behavioural Control significantly predicted intentions to use a smart phone while crossing the road, accounting for 62% of variance in Intentions for the entire sample, and 54% of the variance for 18-30 year olds. Additional variables of Mobile Phone Involvement and Group Norms provided an additional significant 6% of the variance explained for both groups. Attitude was by far the strongest predictor for both the whole sample and for 18-30 year olds, accounting for 38% and 41% explained variance, respectively. This suggests that pedestrians with positive attitudes towards using their smart phones while crossing the road have stronger intentions to do so. Moreover, high exposure was associated with stronger intentions to use a smart phone while crossing, and the effect was large, suggesting high frequency mobile phone use may lead to riskier habits, such as failing to interrupt use while crossing the road. Interventions should target pedestrians under 30 years old and aim to strengthen negative attitudes towards using smart phones while crossing, or to challenge the perceived advantages or emphasise the disadvantages of using one's phone while crossing in order to reduce intentions to do so. Young people's perceptions that others in their social group approve of smart phone use while crossing could also be an important factor to address. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Given limited extant research, we assessed the use of portable, battery-powered cannabis vaporizers by adult e-cigarette users. Methods: 522 adult vapers completed an online survey. Demographics; lifetime and past-month cannabis vaporization via e-cigarettes/vape-pens; preferences for hash oil, D-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) wax, or dried buds; and cannabis vaporization beliefs and motives were examined. Demographics, age of e-cigarette onset, e-cigarette use frequency, state-level legal status of cannabis, cannabis vaping beliefs/motives, and impulsivity were examined as predictors of lifetime cannabis vaporization, past-month cannabis vaporization, and cannabis vaping frequency. Results: E-cigarette users reported lifetime (17.8%) and past-month (11.5%) cannabis vaporization. Vapers preferred hash oil (LT/PM 45.5/47.5%), THC wax (15.2/32.2%), and dried buds (39.4/35.6%). Motivations to vape cannabis included: it tastes better (39.3/37.9%), is healthier (42.9/39.7%), is easier to conceal/hide (35.7/46.6%), does not smell as strong (42.9/39.7%), is more convenient (42.9/27.6%), and produces a stronger/better high (58.1/40.7%) than smoking cannabis. Lifetime and past-month cannabis vaporization, respectively, were associated with initiating e-cigarette use at an earlier age (odds ratio (OR) = 0.09/0.88), being impulsive (OR = 2.25/3.23), having poor self-control (OR = 2.23/1.85), and vaporizing cannabis because it is easier to conceal/hide (OR = 2.45/2.48) or is more convenient than smoking cannabis (OR = 5.02/2.83). Frequency of vaping cannabis was associated with heavier e-cigarette use ((2)(p) = 0.10) and impulsivity ((2)(p) = 0.09). Conclusions: Adult e-cigarette users are vaporizing cannabis using e-cigarettes/vape-pens. Efforts to curb cannabis vaporization may benefit from targeting impulsivity in users and regulating device features that facilitate or promote convenient, inconspicuous cannabis use.

AB  - Smartphone use is transforming the meaning of being online, especially for African-Americans and Latinos. To what extent has this enabled these populations to become digital citizens, able to participate in society online? Internet use is increasingly important for the exercise of the political, economic and social rights that have often been associated with citizenship [Mossberger, K., Tolbert, C. J., & McNeal, R. S. (2008). Digital citizenship: The Internet, society, and participation. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press], and can be measured by the political and economic activities that individuals engage in online. Using unique survey data from a diverse city, we use multilevel analysis and interactions to examine relationships between forms of access and activities online in 2013, controlling for neighborhood context as well as individual characteristics. In contrast with prior work, we find that while broadband access is most strongly associated with political and economic activities online, that mobile is as well. The effects are strongest for African-Americans and Latinos, especially for Latinos who live in heavily Latino neighborhoods - who have lagged behind furthest in Internet use.

AB  - Objectives: 1) To enhance the content of an ontology for designing virtual environments (VEs) for upper limb motor rehabilitation of stroke patients according to the suggestions and comments of rehabilitation specialists and software developers, 2) to characterize the perceived importance level of the ontology, 3) to determine the perceived usefulness of the ontology, and 4) to identify the safety characteristics of the ontology for VEs design according to the rehabilitation specialists.
   Methods: Using two semi-structured Web questionnaires, we asked six rehabilitation specialists and six software developers to provide us with their perception regarding the level of importance and the usability of the ontology. From their responses we have identified themes related to perceived and required safety characteristics of the ontology.
   Results: Significant differences in the importance level were obtained for the Stroke Disability, VE Configuration, Outcome Measures, and Safety Calibration classes, which were perceived as highly important by rehabilitation specialists. Regarding usability, the ontology was perceived by both groups with high usefulness, ease of use, learnability and intention of use. Concerning the thematic analysis of recommendations, eight topics for safety characteristics of the ontology were identified: adjustment of therapy strategies; selection and delimitation of movements; selection and proper calibration of the interaction device; proper selection of measuring instruments; gradual modification of the difficulty of the exercise; adaptability and variability of therapy exercises; feedback according to the capabilities of the patient; and real-time support for exercise training.
   Conclusions: The rehabilitation specialists and software developers confirmed the importance of the information contained in the ontology regarding motor rehabilitation of the upper limb. Their recommendations highlight the safety features and the advantages of the ontology as a guide for the effective design of VEs.

AB  - Changes in technology, economy, and demography have generated today's mobile and flexible workplace. These aspects, while leading to more permeable boundaries, render it more difficult to manage the boundaries between life domains. We conducted a quasi-experimental study to evaluate the effects of an intervention teaching mindfulness as a cognitive-emotional segmentation strategy to promote well-being. In all, 191 employees participated in the 3-week online self-training intervention and completed the preintervention-postintervention and follow-up questionnaires. As expected, the experimental group participants compared to the control group participants experienced significantly less emotional exhaustion and negative affect, and significantly more life satisfaction. Moreover, we could show that boundary management competency can be improved with an online-based self-training intervention.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the determinants that influence students' decision-making and satisfaction in campus e-voting, and to investigate the moderating effect on students' decision-making and satisfaction in campus e-voting between students with different levels of trust in the system.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study employed a quantitative method and applied the use of self-administered questionnaires among university students who have at least experienced once in casting votes electronically in the past year during the campus e-voting period. The data were analysed using partial least square-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) approach.
   Findings - The PLS-SEM approach revealed that voters' commitment to vote was the strongest determinant of students' decision-making and satisfaction in campus e-voting. Voters' high satisfaction with campus e-voting was based on the commitment and requirement of students of the university to vote. Compulsory voting was not a hassle for them in order to achieve campus development and sustainability. A moderation analysis revealed that the relative influence of commitment to vote on students' satisfaction in campus e-voting was higher in the group with medium level of trust than among the group with high level of trust.
   Practical implications - The election commission of the university and the university management should increase students' turnout and commitment to vote during campus e-voting by outlining effective marketing strategies, campaigns and promotions across a number of digital platforms, including mobile SNS. They need to ensure that voters can sense their involvement is warranted and will continue to vote electronically in the next campus election.
   Originality/value - The research yielded an exclusive perspective into students' decision-making and satisfaction in campus e-voting. It also uncovered the influence of moderating effect of trust in the system in developing countries which is marginally concealed in the literature. The measurements produced can be used as a research tool for more exploratory and explanatory research related to political marketing among young adult voters.

AB  - We focus on "curated news:" a collection of links delivered to one's inbox, phone, or RSS feed. These digests vary in the extent to which they contextualize the information they present. Some offer headlines with links to the full article, while others summarize and interpret the story for the reader. Using a survey experiment, we vary the amount of contextualization present in a set of curated links. We find that increased curation decreases the likelihood that individuals will seek out the original source of political information, but it does lead people to recall more information about the issues being discussed.

AB  - Purpose - No studies in the extant literature have explored the role of media richness, i.e., the ability of media to enhance understanding among communication partners in a timely manner, in determining customer loyalty to mobile instant messaging (MIM). Grounded in media richness theory, the purpose of this paper is to examine how media richness influences customer perceived values, consequently contributing to customer loyalty to MIM.
   Design/methodology/approach - Collecting data by an online survey, the authors apply partial least square procedures for hypothesis testing.
   Findings - The authors obtain the following findings: multiple cues are positively related to functional value; immediate feedback is positively related to social value; personal focus is positively related to self-expressive value; language variety is positively related to all the above values that lead to user loyalty; and language variety has the strongest effect on user loyalty to MIM.
   Originality/value - A first attempt to examine the impact of media richness on user loyalty to MIM, this study provides insights for MIM service providers to make decisions to build loyal user bases.

TI  - The practicalities of SMS research

CP  - 7th International Conference on Are We there Yet Where Technological Innovation is Leading Research
AB  - This paper describes a survey based on SMS messaging, presenting details of the tests and pilots undertaken, the practical difficulties found and overcome, as well as an examination of the differences found between the CATI and SMS elements of the survey. It also describes pilot surveys undertaken to test mixed mode methods: SMS-td-online and SMS-to-IVR (interactive yoke response). As the paper describes, Network Research has a long-standing relationship with a top service provider, which interacts with its customers through high-street outlets, by phone and online. For the past 15 years and more Network Research has conducted customer satisfaction surveys to cover all those interactions, mainly using computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI). Throughout the relationship with this client, Network Research has periodically investigated different means of data collection as an alternative or adjunct to CATI. Its primary motivation has been to seek more cost-efficient ways of collecting timely data (proximate to a specific event) from the customer base. Cost saving is not the only criterion, however. Consideration has also to be given to impact on the customer; attribution, confidentiality and data protection issues; potential biases leading to skewed and unrepresentative scores (non-response, age, gender, geographic); representing outlet and organisation structure; and scalability. Considerable time and effort has gone into refining the CATI approach to render it as cost- and methodologically efficient as possible. Nonetheless CATI is still, relative to other options like online or other self-completion methods a higher cost approach. However, it is also the 'gold standard' on each of the non-cost criteria above. Pure online surveys have limited application for this client: among all but digital customers, very few customer email addresses are available. Where online research is conducted, the surveys generally suffer from low response rates. In 2015, Network Research started to supplement CATI data for the largest of the customer satisfaction surveys, among high-street customers, with a survey based on SMS messaging (or 'text messaging' via mobile phone). This paper will be of interest to anyone who is contemplating using SMS methodology.

AB  - Individual actions are both constrained and facilitated by the social context in which individuals are embedded. But research to test specific hypotheses about the role of space on human behaviors and well-being is limited by the difficulty of collecting accurate and personally relevant social context data. We report on a project in Chitwan, Nepal, that directly addresses challenges to collect accurate activity space data. We test if a computer assisted interviewing (CAI) tablet-based approach to collecting activity space data was more accurate than a paper map-based approach; we also examine which subgroups of respondents provided more accurate data with the tablet mode compared to paper. Results show that the tablet approach yielded more accurate data when comparing respondent-indicated locations to the known locations as verified by on-the-ground staff. In addition, the accuracy of the data provided by older and less healthy respondents benefited more from the tablet mode.

AB  - The number of mobile apps launched in the market has exponentially grown to more than 2 million, but little is known about how users choose and consume apps of numerous categories. This study develops a utility theory-based structural model for mobile app analytics. We use the theoretical concepts of utility and satiation along with the factor analytic approach, as bases in simultaneously modeling the complex relationships among choice, consumption, and utility maximization for consumers of various mobile apps. Using a unique panel dataset detailing individual user-level mobile app time consumption, we quantify the baseline utility and satiation levels of diverse mobile apps and delineate how app preferences and consumption patterns vary across demographic groups affected by persistent use and time trends. The findings suggest that users' baseline utility substantially diverges across app categories and that their demographic characteristics and habit formation explain the appreciable heterogeneity in baseline utility and satiation. These parameters also exhibit positive and negative correlations in mobile websites and app categories. Our modeling approaches and computational methods can unlock new perspectives and opportunities for handling large-scale, micro-level data, while serving as important resources for big data analytics and mobile app analytics.

KW  - ENGAGEMENT
AB  - This article explores how mobile phones function as an affective technology for young adults, by adapting the self-expansion model to understand attachment to mobile phones. In an online survey, 272 smart phone users reported on their recalled responses to loss/separation from their mobile phone (not by choice), as well as their use of the mobile phone for self-expansion. Results show that self-expansion via mobile phone was associated with greater inclusion of the mobile phone in the self-concept and greater subjective well-being. Most respondents reported negative feelings, such as loneliness/disconnection, anxiety, and boredom, when without their mobile phone, but others felt relieved to be out of touch with others. The use of the mobile phone for self-expansion was associated with more negative emotion and less positive emotion (relief) in response to loss/separation from the phone. Interpretations of the findings are discussed.

AB  - This cross-sectional study aimed to identify gender differences in the cervical postures when young adults were using mobile phones, as well as the correlations between the postures and the digital devices use (computer and mobile phone). Questionnaires regarding the habits of computer and mobile phone use were administrated to 429 subjects aged from 17 to 33 years old (19.75 +/- 2.58 years old). Subjects were instructed to stand habitually and use a mobile phone as in daily life; the sagittal head and cervical postures were measured by head flexion, neck flexion angle and gaze angle. Male participants had a significantly larger head flexion angle (96.41 degrees +/- 12.23 degrees vs. 93.57 degrees +/- 12.62 degrees, p = 0.018) and neck flexion angle (51.92 degrees +/- 9.55 degrees vs. 47.09 degrees +/- 9.45 degrees, p < 0.001) than females. There were significant differences in head (F = 3.62, p = 0.014) and neck flexion (F = 3.99, p = 0.009) between different amounts of computer use.
   Practitioner Summary: We investigated possible gender differences in head and neck postures of young adults using mobile phones, as well as the potential correlations between these postures and digital device use. We found that males displayed larger head and neck flexion angles than females, which were associated with the amount of computer use.

AB  - Cloud computing has been a phenomenon nowadays. The ability to access, store/retrieve and share information anytime, anywhere on the cloud has contributed to the birth of the cloud-based virtual learning environment (c-VLE). Though there are studies conducted on the grid-based VLEs, however due to the significant differences between the two computing technologies; the findings from prior studies may not be germane in the c-VLE context. Unlike the previous studies which studied TAM, UTAUT and their extensions from the perspective of undergraduates and university instructors, this study examined the role of Channel Expansion Theory (CET), VLE related attributes (i.e. interactivity, content design, trust-in-website), school support and knowledge sharing attitude from the perspective of school teachers. Educational level and teaching experience were introduced as the control variables. Data were gathered in two waves of nation-wide surveys with random sampling. The findings revealed significant effects of CET, all VLE related attributes (except content design), school support and attitude towards knowledge sharing on behavioural intention (BI). BI was found to have direct effect on instructional effectiveness (IE). The model explained 68.9%, 62.5% and 28.9% variances in CET, BI and IE. The study provides theoretical and practical implications to the scholars and practitioners. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The traditional innovation function, focusing on extrinsic motivations such as economic benefits and returns, has neglected the side of intrinsic values and public motivations for innovation function. Recent innovation examples in an era of mobile network and web-based information environment pursue open connected innovations such as open source movement and crowding source. Such open, collective and social innovations result from strong public motivation and trust network. Although previous studies argue the potential effects of intrinsic values on innovative attitude, research has not yet provided a comprehensive empirical evidence on how innovative attitude is associated with intrinsic and public motivations. Little empirical research remains for the impact of public motivations and intrinsic values on innovative attitudes. This study, relying on nationally represented survey (n = 3,188) in South Korea, explores an empirical link between public motivations and innovative attitudes to explore and allow new ideas. We found that public interest, empathy, altruism and job involvement facilitate innovative attitude to pursue and accept new ideas and suggestions. This implies that both intrinsic values (job enjoyment and satisfaction) and public motivations (public interests, empathy and altruism) are crucial factors to promote innovative attitudes. We also found strong non-linear relationships between satisfaction, trust and innovative attitude. We discuss implications for future innovation function of intrinsic and public motivations in terms of the process of social construction.

AB  - Most survey questions are closed questions, where respondents have to select an answer from a proposed set of alternatives. However, a lot of surveys also include, at least occasionally, some open questions. Open questions that call for elaborated and developed answers, called "open narrative questions", are used when the researchers want to go deeper into what the respondents think. This paper compares the answers to open narrative questions when the respondent is participating in a PC survey, in a smartphone-not-optimised survey or in a smartphone-optimised survey. The experiment was carried out in Spain using data collected by the Netquest online access panel. Respondents were assigned randomly to each type of device and survey format, in two successive waves. Because respondents have to type in their answer, we expect differences between devices, linked with the size and the kind of keyboards (i.e. physical versus digital, touch-screen or not). Differences are observed between answers that come from PCs and smartphones for the response time per written character, for the number of total characters and for the use of abbreviations, but not for the non-answer and non-substantive responses. No differences are observed between optimised and not optimised versions for smartphones, except for the response time per character written.

AB  - Work-based learning refers to the learning process occurring at workplace as acquiring knowledge and skills or developing approaches to solve problems. It is a crucial approach to promote professionals' working efficiency. However, the majority of research on professional learning concentrates on holding trainings (off-the-job or on-the-job), seminars and workshops, or on implementing systems for distributing training materials or facilitating communication. Few effort has been paid to support work-based learning which has the characteristics like informal, spontaneous, work-related and just-in-time. The purpose of our work is to facilitate professionals' work-based learning with a context aware mobile system. This system can guide professionals to engage in work-based learning activities, which are arranged properly based on our online survey results. It can also provide learning supports which are adapted to current engaged work, professionals' learning needs, personal characteristics, environmental situations, etc. In this paper, we present successively the work -based learning activity design, the system structure design, the system technical implementation, the system functionalities and evaluation of learning achievement, and the user attitude and acceptance about this system. With the proposed system, professionals can use their mobile devices to get personalized, adaptive and just in-time learning supports in real working environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We conducted an online survey which received responses from 598 participants attending a public university in Ankara, Turkey. The results showed that both the duration of smartphone usage and cyberloafing positively affected smartphone addiction. The effect of self-regulation on smartphone addiction was negative and significant. In addition, neither self-regulation nor general self-efficacy had an effect on cyberloafing. Research results are discussed within the context of the effect of smartphone addiction on learning environments and individuals. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Digital media, especially mobile communication technologies, enable adolescents to explore and experiment with each other with only limited adult control. Conflicts between peers can be easily staged since nearly everybody can be reached at any time under the radar of authorities. Therefore, involvement in conflicts and bullying might depend on how adolescents use and behave online. In the present study, we provide a comprehensive picture of the role aspects of online communication play in long-term involvement in cyberbullying. We focused on a gender-specific perspective, as girls and boys were found to differ not only according to their online communication but also in their cyberbullying involvement. Using a two-wave panel survey of 1817 adolescents between 13 and 17 years (56 % female), we found that girls' cyberbullying involvement (perpetration and victimization) could be traced back to more intensive online social activities and a higher amount of online contact with strangers. In contrast, for boys, only higher exposure to antisocial media content predicted higher levels of victimization over time. The findings indicate that certain patterns of online communication increase the cyberbullying risk over time. However, it needs to be noted that these risk factors vary between girls and boys.

AB  - Based on data collected through the Net Children Go Mobile survey of approximately 3500 respondents aged 9-16years in seven European countries (Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Romania and the United Kingdom), this article examines the diffusion of smartphones among children and contributes to existing research on mobile digital divides by investigating what influences the adoption of smartphones among children and whether going online from a smartphone is associated with specific usage patterns, thus bridging or widening usage gaps. The findings suggest the resilience of digital inequalities among children, showing how social inequalities intersect with divides in access and result in disparities in online activities, with children who benefit from a greater autonomy of use and a longer online experience also reaching the top of the ladder of opportunities.

AB  - Modern technology allows for surveying through different media (e.g. Internet, mobile phones, tablets), which may influence the quality of collected data with additional effects due to the survey mode and should be pretested with the purpose of avoiding effects that would deteriorate the quality of collected data. In the present study, we analysed the technological development of surveying tools by testing the applicability of cognitive interviews on several different survey modes. We focused on the importance of the cognitive interviewer and the effect of reducing their degree of involvement on the quality of the interview results. We carried out personal interviews, interviews using voice-over-Internet protocol, interviews using programs for instant messaging, and web-based interviews; these enabled us to analyse the quality of each survey mode and recognize their advantages and deficiencies. Through the comparison of these modes and their assigned technique, we showed that the role of a cognitive interviewer is important for the quality of interviews regardless of the degree of their involvement in the survey process. However, the requirement for the pretesting situation to resemble the actual final process leads to a necessity to develop new, enhanced approaches to cognitive interviewing on trending survey modes.

AB  - Smart phone marketers are finding it difficult to maintain market share in a market characterised by fierce competition and continued new product development. Generation Y consumers generally have a good command of technology and engage in technology -related behaviour such as texting, tweeting and web-surfing. When it comes to the adoption of smart phone applications, it is believed that Generation Y is leading the way. To retain Generation Y consumers, it is critical for organisations to ensure that customer satisfaction is achieved, brand loyalty has to be generated and meaningful long-term relationships with these consumers should be established. In this regard, this study aims to determine the interrelationships between customer satisfaction, brand loyalty and the relationship intentions of Generation Y smart phone users. Self-administered questionnaires were fielded among 395 Generation Y smart phone users living in Gauteng, South Africa. Results indicate significant and positive interrelationships between customer satisfaction, brand loyalty and relationship intention.

AB  - This study suggests an integrated model that explains the associations among motivations for using cellphone texting, usage patterns, and psychological consequences. Using data from an online survey (N = 335), the study identified motivations of communication with strong ties and weak ties, which were found to be associated with different usage patterns of cellphone texting. Further, time spent on cell phone texting was negatively associated with relationship satisfaction, while the number of text messages sent and received was associated with reduced feelings of loneliness through higher levels of perceived intimacy and relationship satisfaction.

AB  - Recently, mass media and researchers have begun to be concerned about excessive dependence on smartphones. Their interest, however, has largely focused on description of the phenomenon (i.e. severity of the addiction, current status of the addiction) or the development of measurement scales to assess the addiction. In this study, we ask a fundamental question about smartphone addiction: what users' common sense of dependence on smartphones is. More specifically, employing a core-periphery analysis of social representations, this article explores how the younger generation has a different understanding of this addiction from the older generation. Findings of the study can provide a rich knowledge about users' perceptions of and attitude toward smartphone addiction.

AB  - The potential of the Internet to act as a global distribution outlet for screen content has long come into conflict with the nationally focused strategies of producers, broadcasters, governments and Internet service providers. Online viewing therefore acts as a useful case study for interrogating how tensions between `global' and `local' manifest within an increasingly digitized media landscape. This article examines the online viewing markets in three countries at different stages of digital maturity (South Korea, Brazil and India) to consider how online viewing has evolved in each. It then examines audience questionnaire and interview data generated in each country to explore how viewers are making sense of and valuing online viewing services. By interrogating all three samples before focusing specifically on India in more detail, it examines two tensions within the global expansion of online film and television distribution: between global trends and local infrastructures and between the ideals of online viewing services and the grounded realities of their daily use.

AB  - This research investigated faking across test administration modes in an employment testing scenario. For the first time, phone administration was included. Participants (N = 91) were randomly allocated to testing mode (telephone, Internet, or pen-and-paper). Participants completed a personality measure under standard instructions and then under instructions to fake as an ideal police applicant. No significant difference in any faked personality domains as a function of administration mode was found. Effect sizes indicated that the influence of administration mode was small. Limitations and future directions are considered. Overall, results indicate that if an individual intends to fake on a self-report test in a vocational assessment scenario, the electronic administration mode in which the test is delivered may be unimportant.

AB  - While recent research has documented a rapid increase in the use of new technologies such as touchscreen tablets early in life, little is known about how young children use tablets, what activities they engage in, and whether family demographic and maternal well-being are associated with early use. Guided by Bronfenbrenner's bioecological theory of human development, the current study addressed these questions with a cross-sectional, online survey of mothers with children between 12 and 48 months of age. Mothers reported on their child's tablet use as well as their own personal well-being (depressive symptoms and role overload) and relational well-being (relationship satisfaction, coparenting quality, conflict frequency). Nearly 63 % of all mothers owned a tablet. Approximately 46 % of children with access typically use a tablet in an average day, with the majority using for 15 min or less. For families who owned a tablet, child's frequency of use was positively associated with child's age and mother's use and negatively associated with mother's relational well-being. Despite the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation that screen media be avoided for children under 24 months, children in our study used tablets, albeit infrequently. Our findings suggest that it is important for researchers to consider the relationship between contextual factors within the family and child media use. Refining their focus for families with particular needs may allow child advocates and policy makers to develop more beneficial media recommendations for families with a variety of circumstances.

AB  - This study investigates the standardization-adaptation paradox during the web-mobile service transition. Specifically, according to the expectation confirmation theory and the desire confirmation theory, the study proposes that user perceptions of the adaptability to the mobile context and of the consistency between the web and mobile services can shape their satisfaction with mobile services. This, in turn, can affect the intention to adopt mobile services. Furthermore, the study also highlights that males and females prefer different strategies (standardization or adaptation), such that perceived adaptability has a stronger impact on satisfaction for males than for females, while perceived consistency has a stronger impact on satisfaction for females than for males. A structural equation modeling analysis was conducted on data collected in China from a survey with 235 responses, and the results confirmed all of the hypotheses of the proposed research model. Theoretical and practical implications are also discussed.

Additionally, it verified whether this phenomenon was equally applicable to male and female students. After implementing systematic random sampling, 293 university students participated by completing an online survey questionnaire posted on the university's student information system. The survey questionnaire collected demographic information and responses to the Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version (SAS-SV) items. The results showed that male and female university students were equally susceptible to smartphone addiction. Additionally, male and female university students were equal in achieving cumulative GPAs with distinction or higher within the same levels of smartphone addiction. Furthermore, undergraduate students who were at a high risk of smartphone addiction were less likely to achieve cumulative GPAs of distinction or higher. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Text2Quit, an interactive text-messaging program, aimed at smoking cessation, has been shown to increase quit rates, but engagement has not been thoroughly explored. Understanding :the program features associated with engagement and behavior change is integral: for effective program design. Objectives: This study explored participants' interaction with the Text2Quit text-messaging program and associations between engagement and smoking. cessation. Methods: The study included the 262 participants who received the Text2Quit intervention. Self-reported engagement measures; primarily usage of Text2Quit keywords and survey responses, were collected through computer records of,participant use; Demographic variables and self-reported smoking, abstinence were recorded in surveys at baseline and 6-Month assessment. Results: The majority of participants (73%) maintained their subscription during the 6-month intervention: On average, participants received 210.51 text messages, 23.75 emails, and logged into the web portal.. 1.94 times Being female was predictive of engagement with the program (beta = 15.39). Program engagement, measured by the keyword PLEDGE (p = .002) and the smokefree Status at 7 Days survey (p < .001):Were associated with 6-Month abstinence; use of keywords SMOKED (p :001), RELAPSE (p = .007), and STOP (p = .023) were inversely related to abstinence. While abstainers (N = 83, 31%) Stayed enrolled. longer and engaged with the program more frequently, program "dose" was not predictive of smoking cessation. Conclusions: Using interactive tools such as Pledges:and reporting on smoking status were predictive of Cessation. Further study of program features is required to understand how to optimally design text messaging programs.

AB  - This research proposes a post-acceptance model of mobile movie-themed games (MMGs) from the perspective of experiential marketing with five experiential elements of MMGs: thematic attractiveness, perceived enjoyment, flow, act, and relate. The online survey method with structural equation modeling was used to empirically examine the proposed model. A total of 388 valid questionnaires from actual MMG users were collected. The potential gender differences were also investigated. The results present three theoretical contributions: (1) loyalty to movie games can be determined by flow, act, and relate; (2) movie-watching intention can be predicted by thematic attractiveness, perceived enjoyment, act, and relate; and (3) gender differences have been found in some theoretical relationships. Further managerial implications are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although a number of instruments have been used to measure Internet skills in nationally representative surveys, there are several challenges with the measures available: incompleteness and over-simplification, conceptual ambiguity, and the use of self-reports. Here, we aim to overcome these challenges by developing a set of reliable measures for use in research, practice, and policy evaluations based on a strong conceptual framework. To achieve this goal, we carried out a literature review of skills-related studies to develop the initial Internet skills framework and associated instrument. After the development of this instrument, we used a three-fold approach to test the validity and reliability of the latent skill constructs and the corresponding items. The first step consisted of cognitive interviews held in both the UK and the Netherlands. Based on the cognitive interview results, we made several amendments to the proposed skill items to improve clarity. The second step consisted of a pilot survey of digital skills, both in the UK and in the Netherlands. During the final step, we examined the consistency of the five Internet skill scales and their characteristics when measured in a representative sample survey of Dutch Internet users. The result is a theoretical, empirically and cross-nationally consistent instrument consisting of five types of Internet skills: operational, navigation information, social, creative, and mobile.

AB  - We are more inclined to visit and eat at a frequented restaurant than a restaurant that is notably deserted. Work on social proof can be transposed into the field of digital technologies. We give more credit to an active and nourished discussion forum compared to a deserted forum. Given this link between quantity and quality, it is interesting to consider the way in which the user builds a representation of the amount of information flowing through a digital device. Is this assessment faithful to reality, biased, overestimated, or underestimated? To answer these questions, we implemented fieldwork in which we asked users from a convenience sample to assess the number of different contributors in a discussion forum. The responses are analysed, and the results are discussed.

AB  - Transhumance is a resource efficient means of livestock production by seasonally moving grazing animals to utilize pastures between varying ecological zones. This article investigated the interrelationship between the environmental services the transhumant provides whilst maintaining its cultural heritage and theorized what the cultural and environmental impacts would be if the practice of transhumance were to vanish. The authors interviewed 45 transhumant families during their 2015 seasonal migration through the Taurus Mountains and in their settled tent sites in Central Anatolia. The interview topics related to geography of the region, migration routes, natural resource constraints and opportunities, animal husbandry, grazing strategies and their income sources. By practicing agro-ecological principles over millennia, the research showed that the transhumant has helped shape a complex mosaic of habitats in one of Mediterranean's most interesting ecosystems. The mobile pastoralist with conservation and natural resource management skills over a long period has reduced erosion control, improved soil quality and deterred the likelihood of forest fires, whilst weaving a resilient social web. The survey also indicated a clear link between social and ecological resilience emphasizing that sustainable development relies on the interconnectedness between biological and cultural diversity. The study recommends special provisions be made by the Turkish government for the educational needs for the children of the transhumant, provide initiatives for improved trading of their produce, introduce law enforcement for oppressive behavior against them and finally support the pastoralists to attain world heritage listing as a unique and an irreplaceable culture for the future welfare of humankind.

AB  - This article addresses the questions of whether paradata can help us to improve the models of panel attrition and whether paradata can improve the effectiveness of propensity score weights with respect to reducing attrition biases. The main advantage of paradata is that it is collected as a by-product of the survey process. However, it is still an open question which paradata can be used to model attrition and to what extent these paradata are correlated with the variables of interest. Our analysis used data from a seven-wave web-based panel survey that had been supplemented by three cross-sectional surveys. This split panel design allowed us to assess the magnitude of attrition bias for a large number of substantive variables. Furthermore, this design enabled us to analyze in detail the effectiveness of propensity score weights. Our results showed that some paradata (e.g., response times and participation history) improved the prediction of panel attrition, whereas others did not. In addition, not all the paradata that increased the model fit resulted in weights that effectively reduced bias. These findings highlight the importance of selecting paradata that are linked to both the survey response process and the variables of interest. This article provides a first contribution to this challenge.

AB  - In 2014, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation released a five-year plan entitled A Space For Us All. The plan outlined a bold new vision for the Canadian public broadcaster, placing digital mobile content at the forefront of the corporation's priorities. This article examines the shifting priorities of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation against established principles of public broadcasting. It also interrogates the relationship between mobile digital media and legal obligations of the public broadcaster under current Canadian broadcasting regulation. Drawing upon Canadian broadcasting history, contemporary data and recent examples from sport and politics in Canada, the article questions this new direction for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and argues that despite the significant new opportunities in mobile digital media, traditional broadcasting methods remain the dominant tool to reach mass audiences and will provide a significant forum for public information and debate for the foreseeable future.

AB  - Understanding social tie development among users is crucial for user engagement in social networking services. In this paper, we analyze the social interactions, both online and offline, of users and investigate the development of their social ties using data trail of how social ties grow' left in mobile and social networking services. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research attempt on studying social tie development by considering both online and offline interactions in a heterogeneous yet realistic relationship. In this study, we aim to answer three key questions: (i) is there a correlation between online and offline interactions? (ii) how is the social tie developed via heterogeneous interaction channels? and (iii) would the development of social tie between two users be affected by their common friends? To achieve our goal, we develop a Social-aware Hidden Markov Model (SaHMM) that explicitly takes into account the factor of common friends in measure of the social tie development. Our experiments show that, comparing with results obtained using HMM and other heuristic methods, the social tie development captured by our SaHMM is significantly more consistent to lifetime profiles of users.

AB  - Shared parent-child experiences while engaged with an iPadTM were examined to determine if and then how parents interact with their children when using mobile digital devices. In total, 104 parent-child dyads participated in an observation session where parent-child interactions using the touchscreen tablet device were video recorded in order to observe first-hand the supports and exchanges between parent and child (age range 46.21-75.9 months). Results indicate that parents provide a great deal of support to their children while interacting with the touchscreen tablet device including verbal, emotional-verbal, physical and emotional -physical supports. The types of support offered did not differ as a function of parent gender or experience with mobile devices (users versus non -users). Overall, parents rated their own experience engaging with the touchscreen tablet and that of their child's positively. Additional survey measures assessed parents' perceptions of their child's technology use and attitudes regarding optimal ages and conditions for introducing and using technology. Most parents indicated a preference for very early introduction to mobile technologies. Implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - The ICT technology expansion and rapid penetration supported by extensive research and innovations has started to change the users' requirements for novel services and applications. Up to now, the evolution of wireless communication systems only focused on improving the way the information is exchanged between two or a group of communication entities. However, emerging user expectations for novel personalized scenarios have driven the requirement for revolutionary and divergent approaches that will foster the virtualization of human emotions, senses, and thoughts. Human Bond Communication reflects this communications paradigm shift. It represents a holistic approach capable of describing and transmitting the features of an object in the way a human perceives it. Human Bond Communication incorporates all human senses for modeling a physical object into an information-digital domain. It also focuses on actuating and transmitting the data of the physical object through an underlying communication platform. This paper elaborates on the Human Bond Communication related topics, providing a comprehensive classification and survey of the current research works, as well as identifying the key challenges for future research.

AB  - In many countries across the world, mobile media has become an embedded part of everyday life. And yet, despite the influence of mobile media in and around art, the notion of "mobile art" or "mobile media art" remains relatively undertheorized and discussed. So what constitutes mobile art? Is it defined by a mobile interface in the process or delivery of the artwork? Or is it defined by a relationship to mobile content or context? Located in and around the field of mobile communication, mobile art has often been sublimated with locative, hybrid, mixed reality, or media arts. This paper argues for an understanding of mobile art as a broader field of creative practice than just locative media practice or media arts. Rather than survey all the examples of mobile art on offer today, this paper will structure mobile art into key three thematic rubrics: intimate copresence, emplaced visuality, ambient play.

AB  - There is some evidence that a scrolling design may reduce breakoffs in mobile web surveys compared to a paging design, but there is little empirical evidence to guide the choice of the optimal number of items per page. We investigate the effect of the number of items presented on a page on data quality in two types of questionnaires: with or without user-controlled skips. Three versions of a 30-item instrument were compared, with 5, 15, or all 30 questions presented on a page, in two different surveys, one with skips and one without. We found that displaying 30 items on a page reduced the breakoff rate by almost one-third compared to presenting five items per page in the questionnaire without skips, but the difference was not statistically significant. In both surveys with and without skips, the completion times were significantly lower in the 30-item per page condition; however, item nonresponse rates were also higher. We give some practical recommendations to guide choices while designing questionnaires for mobile web surveys.

AB  - Mobile Internet has developed rapidly, and various types of mobile Internet services have changed people's lifestyles profoundly. Consequently, there is a broad market for mobile Internet service providers. To provide better service and attract users, service providers must understand their users' behavior patterns. This study proposes a framework to model users' mobile online behavior based on a multi-state model and a hidden Markov model; this study also extracts typical sequential behavior patterns through clustering methods. The results of the experiments display several characteristic behavior patterns that can guide service providers in application designing, operating, and marketing.

AB  - This article provides evidence that there is a substantial difference between slider scales and visual analogue scales (VAS), two types of rating scales used in web surveys that are frequently mixed up. In an experimental design, both scales were compared to standard HTML radio buttons and offered three, five, or seven response options. Slider scales negatively affect response rate (especially on mobile devices), the sample composition, the distribution of values, and also increase response times. VAS and radio buttons, however, can be used without negative side effects, even on touch screen devices like smartphones. Overall, it is recommended to avoid slider scales. As small differences in rating scaleshere drag and drop versus point and clickhave a huge influence on data collection, an optimal implementation of VAS is suggested. However, measurement of discrete variables with a moderate number of response options should be done with radio buttons scales unless a small screen sizefor example, on smartphonesrequires an economical use of space.

AB  - Microvolunteering is bite-size volunteering with no commitment to repeat and minimum formality, involving short and specific actions. Online microvolunteering occurs through an internet-connected device. University students' online microvolunteering decisions were investigated using an extended theory of planned behavior (TPB) comprising attitudes and normative and control perceptions, with the additional variables of moral norm and group norm. Participants (N=303) completed the main TPB questionnaire and 1-month follow-up survey (N=171) assessing engagement in online microvolunteering. Results generally supported standard and additional TPB constructs predicting intention. Intention predicted behavior. The findings suggest an important role for attitudes and moral considerations in understanding what influences this increasingly popular form of online activity.

In this paper, we ask whether online news has any influence on the financial market, and we also investigate how much influence it has. We explore the burgeoning literature on the predictability of financial movements using online information and report its mixed findings. In addition, we collate the efforts of various disciplines, including economics, text mining, sentiment analysis and machine learning, and we offer suggestions for future research.

AB  - Introduction.-International mobility of researchers has always been a characteristic of academia. However, it became more intense in recent years. While long stays abroad are strongly promoted, their personal impact has only been rarely assessed.
   Objective.-The aim of this study is to establish to what extent a long stay abroad influences work engagement, well-being feeling, affective organizational commitment and attitude towards future international mobility.
   Method.-Participants included 188 researchers who responded to an online survey.
   Results.-Results indicate that work engagement and well-being increase when the international mobility is perceived as successful. Analyzes also show that mobility perceived as voluntary and successful positively predicts favorable attitude towards future international mobility. In addition to these results, descriptive statistics report that men are more inclined to be mobile than women.
   Conclusion.-The positive effects of the international mobility are discussed as well as its perverse effects. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - As software service platforms grow in number of users and variety of service offerings, it raises the question of how this phenomenon impacts the value obtained by users. This paper identifies system usability, service variety, and personal connectivity to be the major determinants that contribute to the value offered to users on mobile software service platforms. A structural equation model, which is based on utility theory, technology acceptance theory, and the theory of network externalities, has been constructed from seven observed constructs, reflecting the three determinants and the user value. The lower bound of user value is estimated through the user's willingness-to-pay for services and the user's willingness to spend time on using services. For the validation, a co-variance-based structural equation analysis has been conducted on online survey data of 210 users of mobile service platforms (e.g., Android, iOS). The results show that the number of services used and the number of active user connections were found to be the strongest constructs explaining user value. Perceived usefulness did not explain user value as much. In total, they can explain 49 % of the value that the user receives from the platform. The implication of this result is that users' value from a software service platform cannot be explained by the technology acceptance model itself. Instead, an approach that, as used in this research, of integrating network externality theory, utility theory, and technology acceptance theory is necessary.

AB  - The main purpose of this study is to investigate the factors influencing the adoption of cloud services. Prior research on the Diffusion Theory usually focuses on innovation attributes and lacks psychological dynamics. This study integrates both the innovation mechanism and psychological mechanism. Gender differences are examined. The survey results discover that relative advantage and observability are important antecedents of cloud services adoption. New technology self-efficacy is also an important predictor of cloud services adoption. The theoretical contribution of this model is its provision of a detailed account of the key forces from the perspective of innovation mechanism and psychological mechanisms underpinning the assessment of adoption intention. It also advances our knowledge that men and women react differently in making cloud usage decisions. Results of the current study indicate that both genders put the emphasis on the utilitarian aspects of cloud services. This study also provides useful suggestions for policy makers and cloud services providers in formulating strategies to enhance cloud services popularity.

AB  - Growth of digital, social, and mobile media has enabled engagement with multiple media activities during news consumption in a more efficient and synchronous fashion than before. This study investigates whether media multitasking activities while consuming political news affects individuals' levels of subjective and factual political knowledge. Results from a Web survey of online panel members show that on the whole, pairwise and bundled forms of media multitasking are negatively related to factual political knowledge. Also, those who engage in media multitasking are more likely to report that they are politically knowledgeable but they do not know about politics as much as they think they do. Implications are discussed for media multitasking and an informed citizenry. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Recently, interactive approaches aimed at helping people practice mindfulness have appeared in the literature. However, the few available user studies for such approaches focus only on short-term effects and are carried out in a lab or in a similar artificial setting. In this study, we aim instead at assessing the effectiveness of a mobile mindfulness app when used by people in their everyday contexts and over a prolonged period of time. People could participate in the study by downloading the app from Apple's App Store as well as Google Play and by answering a mindfulness questionnaire at three pre-set times over a 4-week period. Moreover, the app automatically collected usage data each time it was used and qualitative feedback at the end of the study. Results reveal that users with no or minimal experience with meditation significantly increased their level of mindfulness over the 4-week study period. Moreover, the qualitative feedback provided by participants indicates that the app was positively perceived as beautiful and its usage elicited positive feelings in most of them. We discuss possible factors that could have contributed to the obtained results. Finally, we analyze how many users abandoned the study and at what times, comparing such data with other studies based on app stores distribution, and giving possible reasons. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Concerns exist that Internet gambling may increase rates of gambling harms, yet research to date has found inconsistent results. Internet gamblers are a heterogeneous group and considering this population as a whole may miss important differences between gamblers. The differential relationship of using mobile and other devices for gambling online has not been considered as compared to the use of computers. The true relationship of Internet gambling on related problems and differences between preferred modes for accessing online gambling may be obscured by confounding personal and behavioural factors. This paper thus uses the innovative approach of propensity score matching to estimate the consequence of gambling offline, or online through a computer, as compared to mobile or other supplementary devices by accounting for confounding effects of difference among groups of Australian gamblers (N = 4482). Gamblers who prefer to gamble online using computers had lower rates of gambling problems as compared to those using mobile and supplementary devices. Individual life cycle was useful to differentiate between groups, indicating age, marital, and employment status should be considered together to predict how people gamble online. This is the first empirical study to suggest that the mode of accessing Internet gambling may be related to subsequent harms. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In contrast to the prominent individualistic view on self-disclosure, this study focuses on self-disclosure in groups of prior acquaintances that both meet offline and communicate online. It compares within-group self-disclosure between offline face-to-face (FtF) interactions and online communication via mobile messaging applications (MMAs). An online-survey (N = 357) was conducted to test for differences between within-group self-disclosure online and offline across four dimensions (amount, depth, breadth, valence). The results show that there is more amount, more breadth and more depth for offline within-group self-disclosure, but it is less positively valenced than online within-group self-disclosure. Interestingly, the mere frequency of communication is higher in an MMA environment. In spite of the permanent availability of the online communication sphere, group members do not permanently disclose personal information to each other online. Thus, for within-group self-disclosure, offline time seems quality time. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Respondents in an Internet panel survey can often choose which device they use to complete questionnaires: a traditional PC, laptop, tablet computer, or a smartphone. Because all these devices have different screen sizes and modes of data entry, measurement errors may differ between devices. Using data from the Dutch Longitudinal Internet Study for the Social sciences panel, we evaluate which devices respondents use over time. We study the measurement error associated with each device and show that measurement errors are larger on tablets and smartphone than on PCs. To gain insight into the causes of these differences, we study changes in measurement error over time, associated with a switch of devices over two consecutive waves of the panel. We show that within individuals, measurement errors do not change with a switch in device. Therefore, we conclude that the higher measurement error in tablets and smartphones is associated with self-selection of the sample into using a particular device.

AB  - The prevalence of telework and other forms of mobile working enabled by digital technology is increasing markedly. Following a socio-technical systems approach, this study aims to examine the role of organisational social support and specific support for teleworkers in influencing teleworker wellbeing, the mediating role of social isolation, potentially resulting from a person-environment mismatch in these relationships, and possible differences in these relationships between low-intensity and hybrid teleworkers. Teleworkers' (n = 804) perceptions of support and telework outcomes (psychological strain, job satisfaction, and social isolation) were collected using an on-line survey of teleworking employees distributed within 28 New Zealand organisations where knowledge work was undertaken. Organisational social support and teleworker support was associated with increased job satisfaction and reduced psychological strain. Social isolation mediated the relationship between organisational social support and the two outcome variables, and some differences were observed in the structural relationships for hybrid and low-intensity teleworker sub-samples. These findings suggest that providing the necessary organisational and teleworker support is important for enhancing the teleworker-environment fit and thereby ensuring desirable telework outcomes.

AB  - Information systems researchers have suggested that the world would move to Uber Commerce (U-Commerce) with a high degree of personalization. However, research in measuring U-Commerce constructs (ubiquity, universality, uniqueness, and unison) is sparse, and out of the 4 U-constructs, only perceived ubiquity has a measurement scale. In the present study, we construct reliable and valid measures for the three other (excluding Perceived Ubiquity) U-constructs. To this end, the study uses a stepwise approach starting from theoretical and qualitative exploration (using focus groups) and follows up with survey research (sampling 250 students and 326, 311, and 511 nonstudents in four consecutive surveys, respectively). Using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, the study develops reliable and valid multidimensional scales for the three U-constructs. Subsequently, the three U-construct scales are integrated with perceived ubiquity to form a comprehensive higher order scale named U-Feat, and it is validated in a nomological network of antecedents and consequences. U-Feat was found to have a significant effect on U-Commerce adoption.

AB  - Given the popularity of checking in at a location via mobile phone, little research has examined the germane motivations tied to location check-in as a form of in-group electronic word-of-mouth and its relation to the concern of privacy. A survey with 255 college students found that the students' privacy concerns - both online and Facebook specific - did not show any relationship with the motivations of location check-in as a means of information sharing. However, the relationship varied among the non-users of location check-in on Facebook. Involvement with mobile phone showed mixed relationships with check in motivations commitment to Facebook, self-development and reputation, and promotional viral communication. Findings not only confirm that young Facebook users are relatively free from the concern of privacy during their location-based information sharing, but also suggest different motivational mechanisms to operate for Facebook users' viral communication depending on the habitualness of their mobile phone use. Implications are discussed for interpersonal marketing strategies on social networking sites. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Using an online national survey data collected during the 2012 South Korean Presidential campaign, this study examined whether and how partisan podcast consumption has an effect in activating the individuals' emotions towards candidates. This study also investigated whether citizens' such emotions consequently influenced political participation. The results showed that the more liberal a person was, the more they listened to a liberal podcast program, Naneun Ggomsuda. Such selective exposure to a liberal podcast program was positively associated with negative emotion and negatively related to positive emotion towards a conservative party presidential candidate. In contrast, the use of the liberal podcast was positively associated with positive emotion and negatively associated with negative emotion towards a liberal party presidential candidate. Both negative and positive emotions towards political candidates were significantly related with individuals' political participation. Most importantly, the results showed that the emotions mediated the relationship between partisan podcast use and political participation. Implications of the findings are discussed.

AB  - Information communication technology contains both a positive and negative side. This study investigates the negative side such as induced stress and its impacts on the productivity and quality of life of business workers. This study contributes to this area of research by focusing on social interactions and personal life after work hours in understanding the phenomenon of technostress. This study examines how social interaction stressors and personal life stressors are related to use of mobile instant messenger after work hours. The related strain is regarded as having a negative influence on productivity and quality of life. A model was proposed and tested using a web-based and offline (face-to-face) survey was employed. Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation model analysis were implemented in AMOS 18.0. The study found that social insecurity, invasion of life, and work-home conflict had a positive relation with perceived strain, which in turn had a negative effect on life satisfaction. On the other hand, perceived strain positively affected productivity. Conclusively, this study developed a model for technostress from mobile communication and empirically tested the validity of the proposed model.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a research model examining users' perceived needs-technology fit of mobile communication software through motivational needs and technological characteristics. The study investigated the effects of perceived needs-technology fit on user satisfaction and intention to continue using mobile communication software.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study proposes a research model based on task-technology fit theory and uses and gratification theory, incorporating key determinants of users' continuance intention toward mobile communication software. An online survey instrument was developed to collect data, and 403 questionnaires were used to test the relationships in the proposed model.
   Findings - The causal model was validated using AMOS 21.0, and all nine study hypotheses were supported. The results indicated that users' perceived needs-technology fit and satisfaction were crucial antecedents of their intention to continue using mobile communication software and that they mediated the influence of users' needs as well as technological characteristics.
   Practical implications - Mobile communication software practitioners should focus on enhancing users' perceived needs-technology fit through motivational needs (utilitarian, hedonic, and social needs) and technological characteristics (mobile convenience, service compatibility, and user control) to further boost user satisfaction and intention to continue using mobile communication software services.
   Originality/value - This study contributes to a theoretical understanding of factors explaining users' continuance intention toward mobile communication software.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify enablers and inhibitors to the adoption of mobile internet services by socioeconomically disadvantaged people: an understudied population adversely affected by digital inequality.
   Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative study combining a questionnaire and semistructured interviews. In total, 32 socioeconomically disadvantaged people explored mobile lottery services and subsequently were asked a series of semi-structured questions about their perceptions of the technology.
   Findings - Users' attitudes toward mobile internet services were ambivalent. They experienced some advantages of smartphones (including escaping spatiotemporal constrains, fashionableness, privacy, and cost-effectiveness) and conceived of mobile internet services in terms of social advantages (including their ubiquitous nature, fitting in socially and fear of being "left behind"). However, they also experienced barriers and concerns, such as limited mobile data packages, external barriers from mobile services (including security concerns, complex online help tutorials, irrelevant pop-ups, and a lack of personalized services) and internal psychological barriers (including technophobia, self-concept, and habitus).
   Research limitations/implications - The findings are of limited generalizability due to the small size of the sample. However, the study has implications for understanding the acceptance of technology among socioeconomically disadvantaged people. Social implications - The study has social implications for bridging digital inequality in terms of socioeconomic status.
   Originality/value - While previous studies have primarily focused on enablers of adopting mobile internet services by active users, this study reveals both the promise of and the barriers to the use of such services by inactive users who comprise an under-served population.

AB  - This article explores technological systems that dissimulate by design. Examples include untrustworthy hotel and workplace thermostats, digital applications to spy on workers and family members, and commercial and law-enforcement systems that surreptitiously collect mobile phone data. Rather than view such cases as exceptional, I argue that deceptive communication systems are hidden articulations of normal technological orders. If deception in itself is not the primary problem with such systems, then transparency alone cannot be the solution. As troubling as institutional opacity might be, an analysis of deceptive systems reveals more fundamental problems: imbalances in power and widespread acquiescence to corporate and state efforts to control individuals, groups, and their data. By moving beyond a quest for (or belief in) technological veracity, scholars could redirect attention to power inequalities and the pressing question of how to live together ethically.

AB  - Purpose - Despite the quick spread of the use of mobile devices in survey participation, there is still little knowledge about the potentialities and challenges that arise from this increase. The purpose of this paper is to study how respondents' preferences drive their choice of a certain device when participating in surveys. Furthermore, this paper evaluates the tolerance of participants when specifically asked to use mobile devices and carry out other specific tasks, such as taking photographs.
   Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected by surveys in Spain, Portugal and Latin America by Netquest, an online fieldwork company.
   Findings - Netquest panellists still mainly preferred to participate in surveys using personal computers. Nevertheless, the use of tablets and smartphones in surveys showed an increasing trend; more panellists would prefer mobile devices, if the questionnaires were adapted to them. Most respondents were not opposed to the idea of participating in tasks such as taking photographs or sharing GPS information.
   Research limitations/implications - The research concerns an opt-in online panel that covers a specific area. For probability-based panels and other areas the findings may be different.
   Practical implications - The findings show that online access panels need to adapt their surveys to mobile devices to satisfy the increasing demand from respondents. This will also allow new, and potentially very interesting data collection methods.
   Originality/value - This study contributes to survey methodology with updated findings focusing on a currently underexplored area. Furthermore, it provides commercial online panels with useful information to determine their future strategies.

AB  - University classrooms have been taken over by a new type of student, the "plurimodalicts". This society is characterized by the different ways its students relate to ICTs. This article analyses where, how and for what a sample of 451 students from five Spanish public universities use their laptop computers. The study uses an incidental non-random cluster sample design. Data collection was conducted via questionnaire based on a five-point Likert scale. The questionnaire was divided into three sections: computer use; location and frequency of use of the device; and laptop functions and applications. The study concludes that "plurimodalicts" use their laptops to produce academic work, as well as for exchanging class notes and searching for information. The distance or direct learning methodology and the respondent's gender also determine laptop use for academic tasks, which is greater at distance learning institutions and is more prevalent among women than men. These devices are mainly used at home and, in the case of the younger respondents, also in university libraries. The laptop functions vary according to age group, and the device is mostly used for gaming and as a study tool by the youngest students.

AB  - This article investigates the daily travelling practices that are related to mobile-only, fixed-only and combined mobile/fixed use of the Internet, and the social differentiations that are related to these three ways of accessing the Internet. Survey data (N = 612) collected from Finland in 2011 are analysed. The article shows that mobile-only Internet use is not associated with particularly diverse or frequent daily travelling practices, whereas combined mobile/fixed use is. Mobile-only Internet users are, in fact, in a relatively disadvantaged position - compared with other users, they are more typically unemployed and their household income is lower. The mobility of Internet access as such does not guarantee a safe social position in society. Mobile Internet use must be complemented with fixed use, which brings about more versatile and frequent travelling. The finding suggests that the mobile-rich get richer' when it comes to Internet use and daily travelling practices.

AB  - More and more respondents use mobile devices to complete web surveys. These devices have different characteristics, if compared to PCs (e.g. smaller screen sizes and higher portability). These characteristics can affect the survey responses, mostly when a questionnaire includes sensitive questions. This topic was already studied by Mavletova and Couper (2013), through a two-wave experiment comparing PCs and mobile devices results for the same respondents in a Russian opt-in panel. We replicated this cross-over design, focusing on an opt-in panel for Spain, involving 1,800 panellists and comparing PCs and smartphones. Our results support most of Mavletova and Couper's (2013) findings (e.g. generally the used device does not significantly affect the reporting of sensitive information), confirming their robustness over the two studied countries. For other results (e.g. trust in data confidentiality), we found differences that can be justified by the diverse context/culture or by the quick changes that are still characterizing the mobile web survey participation.

AB  - Since early in the development of children's television, research has informed policy and practice involving young children's media use. To increase the likelihood that new media support children's development, research in the coming decade must stay current with advancing technology. With the advent of various forms of interactive digital media, key research questions involve social and physical interactivity. How should adults appropriately support children's use of different kinds of media to promote children's creativity, learning, and development? How does co-viewing (social interaction) overlap with and differ from contingency built into the medium itself? When a device interacts, does that change the kind of support required of a co-viewing adult, or eliminate the need for such support? How does the introduction of new technology impact the lives of families? Issues related to video chat, touchscreen and motion capture technology, artificial intelligence, and electronic books and games are discussed.

AB  - When using Short Message Service (SMS) as a tool for data collection in psychological research, participants can be contacted at any time. This study examined how sampling frequency and time of day of contact impacted on response rates, response completeness, and response delay in repeated measures data collected via SMS. Eighty-five undergraduate students completed a six-item self-report questionnaire via SMS, in response to 20 SMS prompts sent on a random schedule. One group responded across 2 days, the other on a compressed schedule of 1 day. Overall, there was a high response rate. There was no significant difference in response rate, completeness, and delay of those responding across 1 or 2 days. Timing between prompts did not impact on response behavior. Responses were more likely to be complete if prompts were sent during the working day. The shortest time between prompts was 15 min, however, and use of an undergraduate sample limits generalizability. When conducting repeated measures sampling using SMS, researchers should be aware that more frequent sampling can be associated with poorer data quality, and should aim to collect data during the working day rather than mornings or evenings.

   Findings - The results indicated that social support, which includes informational support and emotional support, has a significant effect on social capital that consists of structural, relational and cognitive capital.
   Originality/value - Although previous research has found the effect of social capital on user behaviour, it has seldom identified the determinants of social capital. Thus, how to build and develop social capital remains a question. This research examined the effect of social support on social capital.

AB  - Different studies have evaluated the factors that lead to the adoption of new online services in general and particularly for Location-Based Services adoption (LBS), as this is seen as a key application for smart-phones. Recently, several security threats and the disclosure of extensive personal data have raised the question, if location data are considered as sensitive data by users. Thus, we use two privacy concern models, namely Concern for Information Privacy (CFIP) and Internet Users' Information Privacy Concerns (IUIPC) to find out. Our sample comprises of 235 individuals between 18 and 34 years (Generation C) from Germany. The results of this study indicate that the second-order factor IUIPC showed better fit for the underlying data than CFIP did. Overall privacy concerns have been found to have an impact on behavioral intentions of users for LBS adoption. Furthermore, other risk dimensions may play a role in determining usage intention, which should be analyzed by further research. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The breakthrough of GPS-equipped smartphones has enabled the collection of track data from human mobility on massive scales that can be used in route recommendation, urban planning and traffic management. In this work we present a fast map server that can generate and visualize heat maps of popular routes online from massive sports track data based on client preferences, e.g., running routes lasting less than an hour. The heat maps shown respect user privacy by not showing routes with less than a predefined number of different users, for instance five. The results are represented to the client using a dynamic tile layer. The current implementation uses data collected by the Sports Tracker mobile application with over 800,000 different tracks and 2.8 billion GPS data points. Stress tests indicate that the server can handle hundreds of simultaneous client requests in a single server configuration.

AB  - Support groups provide opportunities for participants to express and get in touch with their feelings and emotions. For children such groups provide a non-threatening environment in which they can share their feelings and concerns openly with one another. The wide range of social networking options made easily accessible via mobile technologies has seen children increasingly connecting with their peers in search of emotional support. For parents and professionals alike the question arises as to whether these online groups provide the positive support environment necessary to ensure children feel comfortable sharing their emotional concerns. In this study qualitative content analysis of the communications shared between the young members of an online support group for siblings of children with special needs revealed that participants felt confident to openly express a range of strong feelings and emotions, including hate, love, confusion, hurt, fear, jealousy and embarrassment.

AB  - Using Rogers' diffusion of innovation model, this study examined the relationships between lifestyles and the adoption of six new technologies in Taiwan. Three of the six technologiesnotebooks, netbooks, and tablet PCsare information technologies, while the remaining three technologiesWii, Kinect, and digital videos (DVs)are entertainment technologies. A telephone survey was adopted to obtain a representative sample, which obtained 1157 valid calls with a response rate of 53.1%. Two conclusions are drawn from the data analysis. First, lifestyles did play a significant role in predicting the adoption of the six technologies. Second, this study found that demographics and mass media use were more predictive of the adoption of information technologies than that of the adoption of entertainment technologies.

AB  - RationaleAs therapeutic interventions are being developed utilising telehealth and mobile phones, it is important to understand how substance-dependent individuals will respond to offers of online assistance.
   ObjectivesThe present paper considered the following: (1) how decision-making style is associated with use and dependence upon commonly used stimulants and (2) how it influences behavioural responses to electronic offers of further information about these drugs.
   MethodAn online survey examined patterns of nicotine and caffeine use, administered Severity of Dependence Scales for caffeine and nicotine and assessed decision-making style using the Melbourne Decision Making Questionnaire and mood using the Kessler Distress Scale. Upon completing these scales, the 181 participants with a mean age of 28.14years were offered further information online.
   ResultsStimulant dependence was associated with psychological distress. Caffeine dependence was linked to hypervigilance (panic). Decisional self-esteem varied with stimulant dependence and Kessler Distress Scale score. Participants with high decisional self-esteem declined electronic offers of further information.
   ConclusionConfidence rather than defensive avoidance was a factor in reducing information-seeking behaviours on the Internet. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - We examined how family communication patterns (FCPs) are associated with frequency of adolescent-parent communication in person, over the phone, via text message, and via email. Adolescents (N = 195) aged 13 to 18 completed an online survey assessing FCPs and frequency of communication methods used with parents. The results revealed that both frequency and method of communication differed by general FCPs; adolescents in higher conformity families reported less frequent text messaging with mothers than adolescents in lower conformity families, and adolescents in higher conversation families (mothers only) and lower conformity families reported more frequent email communication with parents. Results set the stage for future research to further explore the processes and outcomes of adolescent-parent communication through communication technology.

AB  - Multicommunicating via mobile phone during face-to-face encounters with family and friends was examined with data from an online survey of 432 adults in the US. Multicommunicating was positively associated with problematic mobile phone use and explained by attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms and a social need to belong. Those with ADHD symptoms were more likely to engage in problematic mobile phone use and frequent multicommunicating. Strong need for social assurance, which involves an "always-on-and-connected" lifestyle through mobile devices, explained problematic mobile phone use and multicommunicating. Need for social assurance also was related to multicommunicating via social connectedness, and this effect was significant among females, but not males. The implications of these findings for future research are discussed.

AB  - This longitudinal study explores the effects of tracking and monitoring time devoted to learn with a mobile tool, on self-regulated learning. Graduate students (n = 36) from three different online courses used their own mobile devices to track how much time they devoted to learn over a period of four months. Repeated measures of the Online Self-Regulated Learning Questionnaire and Validity and Reliability of Time Management Questionnaire were taken along the course. Our findings reveal positive effects of tracking time on time management skills. Variations in the channel, content and timing of the mobile notifications to foster reflective practice are investigated, and time-logging patterns are described. These results not only provide evidence of the benefits of recording learning time, but also suggest relevant cues on how mobile notifications should be designed and prompted towards self-regulated learning of students in online courses.

AB  - This study assesses differences in use of social networking sites (SNSs) and relates them to different patterns of political participation, media use motivations, and political efficacy. Based on a Web survey of 1,230 South Korean voters, it finds that informational uses of SNSs are positively associated with expressive participation both online and offline, but not with collective participation. The use of SNSs for social interaction purposes was associated only with online expressive participation. Recreational uses had a negative or insignificant relationship with expressive and collective participation. Political efficacy moderated the impact of social interaction uses of SNSs on expressive participation both online and offline. The findings suggest that the political impact of SNSs is mostly limited to expressive participation and dependent upon users' motivations.

AB  - A questionnaire-based study aimed to explore the link between Internet addiction, problematic mobile phone use and the occurrence of cognitive failures in daily life. Previous research has suggested that individuals who have lower working memory capacity (VVMC) and poorer attentional control (AC) maybe poorer at limiting the distraction effect posed by access to communicative digital media such as the Internet and mobile phones (Unsworth, McMillan, Brewer, & Spillers, 2012). 210 participants completed an online questionnaire which comprised of the Online Cognition Scale (OCS; Davis, Flett, & Besser, 2002), the Problematic Mobile Phone Use Scale (MPPUS; Bianchi & Phillips, 2005) and the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ; Broadbent, Cooper, FitzGerald, & Parkes, 1982). Both the OCS and MPPUS were significantly positively correlated to scores on the CFQ Further analysis revealed a significant difference between high and low scoring groups for both the MPPUS and the OCS and scores on the CFQ with those in the higher groups presenting greater self reported cognitive failures. The results are interpreted as being symptomatic of individuals in the higher OCS and MPPUS groups as being less resilient to the distractions posed by digital media and technology with a suggested link to lower WMC and AC.

AB  - There is growing interest in the potential value of using phone applications that can monitor driver behaviour (Smartphone Driver Support Systems, 'SDSSs') in mitigating risky driving by young people. However, their value in this regard will only be realised if young people are willing to use this technology. This paper reports the findings of a study in which a novel structural model of willingness to use SDSSs was tested. Grounded in the driver monitoring and Technology Acceptance (TA) research literature, the model incorporates the perceived risks and gains associated with potential SDSS usage and additional social cognitive factors, including perceived usability and social influences. A total of 333 smartphone users, aged 18-24, with full Irish driving licenses completed an online questionnaire examining willingness or Behavioural Intention (BI) to uptake a SDSS. Following exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, structural equation modelling indicated that perceived gains and social influence factors had significant direct effects on BI. Perceived risks and social influence also had significant indirect effects on BI, as mediated by perceived gains. Overall, this model accounted for 72.5% of the variance in willingness to uptake SDSSs. Multi-group structural models highlighted invariance of effects across gender, high and low risk drivers, and those likely or unlikely to adopt novel phone app technologies. These findings have implications for our understanding of the willingness of young drivers to adopt and use SDSSs, and highlight potential factors that could be targeted in behavioural change interventions seeking to improve usage rates.

AB  - Although text messaging while driving is illegal in Spain previous research has shown that a substantial proportion of drivers, particularly young drivers, engage in this risky behaviour. The present study set out to investigate the psychological predictors of this behaviour using the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). This study also measured the drivers' perceptions regarding the effectiveness of the ban on mobile phone use while driving, their perceived crash risk, the risk of being fined and the drivers perceived ability to compensate for the distraction caused by reading or writing text messages while driving. Data were collected using an online questionnaire from 1082 university students who were drivers and owned a mobile phone. Attitude and perceived behavioural control significantly predicted the intention to send and read text messages while driving, even after controlling for exposure and demographic variables. Furthermore, intention was found to be a significant predictor of retrospective measures of both sending and reading text messages while driving, as was perceived behavioural control for several of the outcome measures. The present findings provide support for the TPB and also demonstrate the additional contributions that the mobile phone ban and perceived ability to compensate for the distraction had in predicting intentions. In addition, perceived crash risk was positively related to the prediction of intentions to send text messages and the number of messages read in the last week. The implications of these findings are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Facilitated by advancement in technology, today, usage of mobile instant messaging (MIM) applications is a dominant global phenomenon that permeates every part of the world. This phenomenon results in drastic shift in customer attitude and behavior on how to connect and interact with others. MIM service has been replacing telecommunications operators (telcos)' short message service, and because third-party MIM applications are those gaining meaningful traction, this trend is threatening the telecommunications industry as it leads to losses in telcos' revenues. To cope with this onslaught of third-party MIM applications, telcos launched Joyn, their own MIM application. However, despite their similar technical characteristics, Joyn still lacks user traction. It is critical, therefore, to understand the antecedents to continuance use intention of MIM applications in both contexts. Based on the expanded expectation-confirmation model (ECM), the present research develops a benefit-confirmation model that examines the antecedents to continuance intention to use MIM applications, while provides a comparative analysis of two popular MIM applications in Korea KakaoTalk (third-party) and Joyn (telcos). A total of 467 data point were collected online. The structural equation modeling results of the total sample provide support for ECM-related hypotheses as well as for significant effects of net benefits and network benefits on continuance intention to use MIM applications, while the comparative analysis suggests that KakaoTalk's prominent features are hedonic in nature, whereas, Joyn's main attribute is its interoperability. The implications of these findings are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The increased acquisition of touch-screen technologies, such as tablet computers, in both homes and schools raises important questions about their role for very young children's learning and development. Their inherent touch-based interaction offers new opportunities for mark making practices, which are linked to literacy development, through the emergent process of using marks as symbolic representation. This paper reports a comparative study of touch-based interaction using a tablet computer versus traditional physical paint and paper. Children aged 2-3 years engaged in a free finger painting activity and colouring in activity in both paper and digital environments. Video data of their interactions was used to develop a coding scheme for analyzing touch-based interaction, providing insight into how the use of fingers and hands differed in each environment, the different types and qualities of touch that were engendered, and the composition of the final paintings produced. Findings show that while the tablet computer limited the number of fingers used for interaction, its material affordances supported speed and continuity, which led to more mark making, and different 'scales' of mark making extending the range of mark making practices. At the same time it limited the sensory experience of physical paint and resulted in more uniform final compositions. The findings are discussed in terms of shaping young children's mark making, the implications of the use of touch screen technologies in literacy development for educational practitioners and technology design, and key future research directions.

AB  - This study investigated the prevalence and antecedents of the so-called phantom phone sensations (PPS) phenomenon - the false perception that one's cell phone is ringing, vibrating, or blinking. While previous studies have already addressed the impact of personality traits and cell phone usage patterns on the likelihood of experiencing phantom phone sensations, we were interested in additionally addressing the impact of situational context factors. An online questionnaire assessed especially cell phone usage patterns (e.g., frequency of cell phone usage), personality traits (e.g., Big Five, need for popularity), and contextual factors (e.g., awaiting a call, being in a noisy environment). Analyses (N = 249; 137 female) revealed that the majority of participants (83.5%) have experienced phantom phone sensations. Multivariate analysis methods indicated that, in particular, contextual factors regarding the social situation (awaiting a call) along with cell phone usage patterns are predictive for the experience of phantom phone sensations. Moreover, age was also found to have a high predictive value.

AB  - We develop a new concept of rural technology diffusion influenced by labor mobility and business relations. The technology gain effect of labor mobility increases technology diffusion, whereas the technology drain effect decreases it. The concept is applied to survey data from the Mekong region, a new geographic area in this context. In the econometric analysis, which takes spatial correlation and geographic variables into account, technology is measured in the form of the number of mobile phones per village. The results support the technology gain and drain effects and show that labor mobility and business relations can help overcome geographic obstacles to rural development. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This study proposes an integrated research model for investigating driver adoption of car navigation systems. We consider the potential causal connections between core cognitive and psychological factors and driver intention to use these systems. We extracted possible factors that may significantly affect the perceived usability of car navigation systems from in-depth interviews with two groups of individuals: an expert group and a driver group. Data collected from N = 1045 drivers via an online survey were analysed by structural equation modelling. The results showed that the service & display quality components of the systems were the most significant determinants of driver attitude and intention to use car navigation systems. Two other factors, namely attitude and perceived usefulness, also had impacts on driver intention. Moreover, both satisfaction and service & display quality were affected by perceived system reliability, while usefulness was affected by both perceived locational accuracy and satisfaction. Satisfaction also significantly affected perceived ease of use. In addition, we introduced new external variables to the technology acceptance model (TAM) and validated the causal connections proposed by the original TAM. The present study provides valuable insights into the core factors that significantly affect driver perspectives of and intention to use car navigation systems.

AB  - In this article, we present an analysis of closings in two counseling media: online, text-based exchanges (usually referred to as "chat" sessions) and telephone calls. Previous research has found that the participant who initiated a conversation preferably also initiates its termination with a possible preclosing. Advice acknowledgments, lying in the epistemic domain of the client, are devices that may work as preclosings. However, in text-based chat clients regularly refrain from advice acknowledgment. While counselors use various practices to elicit advice acknowledgment in the context of potential advice resistance, hoaxing, and/or seemingly long pauses, these questions do not always succeed as "closing devices." This offers an explanation for counselors' perception of online chatting as more difficult than calling. The data are in Dutch with English translation.

AB  - This paper developed and evaluated a Lilliput Multimedia (LM) system to enhance students' learning motivation by bringing them personally onto the scene to explore the world without having to leave the classroom. The LM system integrates of digital multimedia exhibition content, remote-controlled toy cars, and toy models of the buildings to motivate the students and engage them to learn as if they were touring a Lilliputian museum. With the help of the LM system, students are able to enjoy touring experiences from within the classroom without having to physically walk through them. In the current study, the theme of "world-famous buildings" was selected as the learning topic to illustrate how the LM system can be used to assist students' learning. The potential of the LM system was evaluated. The participants were 30 fifth-grade elementary-school students. Questionnaires, interviews and video records were utilized to study the students' acceptance of using the LM system and to assess students' attitude towards learning about world-famous buildings. The findings show that the students responded very positively to learning using this multimedia learning system.

AB  - This study examined the use of mobile phones to regulate negative emotions, considering both the role of different aspects of phone use and individual differences in emotion regulation strategies. A total of 287 young adult smartphone users completed an online survey that addressed use of mobile phones for negative emotion regulation. They responded to a phone loss scenario by rating how much they would miss various uses/functions of the phone (which could be involved in emotion regulation). Habitual use of reappraisal to regulate emotion was associated with missing both interpersonal contact and social support, but not access to entertainment/information. In contrast, habitual use of emotion suppression was associated only with missing entertainment/information content. Regulating negative emotions via mobile phone was associated with missing all three uses/functions of the phone, but perception that the phone was effective in remediating negative emotion was associated only with missing social support. Well-being was related to greater use and perceived effectiveness of the mobile phone for emotion regulation. Overall, this study demonstrates that mobile phones can yield psychological benefits, depending on how they are used. Findings suggest that using the phone for social support is most likely to lead to effective remediation of negative emotion. Interpretations and implications of the findings are discussed.

AB  - Using a comprehensive personality model, this study is the first to examine the relationship between a full range of personality traits and cell phone addiction. 346 college students completed an online survey that asked respondents to complete measures of the Big-Five personality traits and measures of materialism and need for arousal, Barratt's (1959) impulsiveness scale, and a four-item measure of cell phone addiction. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Couched in Mowen's (2000) 3M Hierarchical Model of Personality, the elemental traits of emotional instability and materialism were positively associated while introversion was negatively associated with cell phone addiction. The central trait of attention impulsiveness exhibited a direct and positive association with cell phone addiction. A significant negative relationship between conscientiousness and all three dimensions of Barratt's impulsiveness scale (central trait) was found. Several additional relationships between the elemental traits of Mowen's personality hierarchy and the three dimensions of impulsiveness (central trait) also were uncovered. Study implications and future research directions are discussed. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In many countries, the proportion of the population using cell phones is higher than that with Internet access. Cell phone and Internet penetration rates are high in most university populations. Despite the recent attention focused on surveys of cell phone users, and the preference for using the Internet to survey university students, there have been few studies comparing cell phone surveys and Web surveys of the student population. This article reports on a mode of experiment conducted using an annual survey of students at a large university in South Korea. The frame of registered students contains both cell phone numbers and e-mail addresses. A sample of students was selected from the list and randomly assigned to a computer-assisted telephone interviewing or Web survey mode. Students were notified of the survey in both modes using both text messaging and e-mail messages. We find that the cell phone survey has an advantage over the Web survey in terms of response rates, coverage of key domains, and item nonresponse. Substantive differences between the two modes were found for about half the survey questions. This suggests that cell phone surveys may be useful for surveys in populations with universal or near-universal coverage, and where cell use may be more popular than Internet use.

AB  - In an earlier paper we described a structured, theory-driven training programme which was administered to 10 individuals with moderate-to-severe memory impairment. All individuals received an errorless-fading-of-cues protocol in the use of personal digital assistants (PDAs) or smartphones (Svoboda, Richards, Leach, & Mertens, 2012) and demonstrated generalisation of acquired skills to day-to-day memory challenges. Maintenance of intervention gains over the long-term is another indicator of successful generalisation. Here we present the maintenance of device use in the same group of individuals 12 to 19 months after programme completion. A within-subject, ABABB multi-case experimental design was used to evaluate the impact of PDA or smartphone use on day-to-day memory functioning at baseline, immediately post-intervention, at return to baseline, and at short-term and long-term follow-up. Results presented here focus predominantly on long-term follow-up. All 10 individuals showed maintenance of gains in day-to-day functioning as quantified across several ecologically valid questionnaire and task-based measures. This was corroborated by family members with whom six of the participants resided. This study further demonstrates the programme's clinical effectiveness in enabling individuals with moderate-to-severe memory impairment to function more independently and with greater confidence up to 19 months following programme completion.

Nationally representative data from a random-sample survey of American adults (N = 2,250) in the 2010 general election were analyzed to better explain who mobile election news users are, how they compare to nonusers, and whether mobile news use was associated with voter turnout and mobile campaign donation. Findings underscore the significance of mobile media use and mobile news as phenomena of emerging importance in the election campaigns, and important differential patterns in the relationships of sociodemographics, mobile media, and electoral participation are discussed. By providing a nuanced accounting of the socioeconomic and demographic profile of mobile election news users and how those individuals differ from nonusers, this study enriches explanations of how societal privilege and the benefits of political engagement are related in complicated ways to individual-level variations in consuming and using mobile election news. Notably, for racial minorities, mobile media may provide a bridge across the digital-driven democratic divide and a more effective means of engaging with digital election information than other ICTs. Analysis also extends what is known about how citizens use mobile news to engage with increasingly personalized election campaigns. Results indicate that mobile election news use was a significant positive predictor of the odds of having voted and whether individuals used their mobile devices to make contributions during the campaign. These findings support arguments that the unique qualities of mobile devices are contributing to new and different pathways to political engagement while also retaining significance in relation to traditional forms of offline political participation.

AB  - News is increasingly being consumed on a multitude of media devices, including mobile devices. In recent years, mobile news consumption has permeated individuals' news consumption repertoires. The main purpose of this study is twofold: (a) gain insight in how mobile news outlets infiltrated the broader news media repertoires of mobile device owners and (b) understand in what circumstances mobile news is consumed within these news media repertoires. The key is to understand how and why this widening agency in appropriating various places and social spaces in everyday life relates to general news media consumption (Peters, 2012). This two-phased study aims to illuminate how mobile device owners position their mobile news consumption in relation to other types of news media outlets. First, a guiding cluster analysis of a large-scale questionnaire (N = 1279) was performed, indicating three types of news consumers. Second, in order to thicken the originally derived clusters, a mixed-method study was set up, combining objective data originating from mobile device logs with more subjective audience constructions through personal diaries and face-to-face interviews (N = 30). This study reveals the Janus-faced nature of mobile news. On the one hand, the majority of news consumers dominantly relies on traditional media outlets to stay informed, only to supplement with online mobile services in specific circumstances. Even then, there is at least a tendency to stick to trusted brand materials. On the other hand, these mobile news outlets/products do seem to increasingly infiltrate the daily lives of mobile audiences who were previously disengaged with news.

AB  - The viewing of television programming on screens other than a television set has become increasingly common. This article discusses the different modes of viewing that have emerged as a result of timeshifting, downloading, streaming and mobile technologies. Using data collected from an online survey (n = 671) over a six-month period in 2010-2011, we present a descriptive and inferential statistical analysis of both traditional and emerging modes of viewing. We also examine whether significant differences exist across three demographic variables: gender, age and country or region of residence. Our findings show that while the majority of viewing still takes place in front of a television screen, the computer has achieved secondary screen status among North Americans and equal status among younger viewers and Europeans. Viewing on a mobile device remains minimal across all demographics.

AB  - Objective: To date, no research has evaluated the efficacy of a stand-alone, smartphone-based intervention for individuals with an alcohol use disorder. The current pilot study evaluated the short-term outcomes of a smartphone-based intervention for alcohol use disorders compared with an Internet-based brief motivational intervention plus bibliotherapy. Method: Adults (18 to 45 years old) with an alcohol use disorder received either the Location-Based Monitoring and Intervention for Alcohol Use Disorders (LBMI-A; n = 28), a smartphone-based intervention, or the online Drinker's Check-up plus bibliotherapy (DCU + bib; n = 26). These groups were compared using the Timeline Followback interview for percent days abstinent (PDA), percent heavy drinking days (PHDD), and drinks per week (DPW) from baseline to 6 weeks after the introduction of the interventions. Results: Multilevel models revealed that the LBMI-A resulted in a significant increase in PDA over the course of the study, whereas the DCU + bib did not. Effect sizes for change from baseline for PDA suggest that the DCU + bib resulted in moderate a decrease, whereas the LBMI-A resulted in a large increase in PDA. Both interventions resulted in significant decreases in PHDD and DPW. The LBMI-A produced larger reductions in the first 3 to 4 weeks after the intervention was introduced than the DCU + bib. On weeks with greater LBMI-A usage, participants reported less DPW and PHDD. Conclusions: Both interventions resulted in significant decreases in alcohol use over the 6-week trial, which is promising for stand-alone technology-based intervention systems aimed at individuals with an alcohol use disorder.

AB  - Interview duration is an important variable in web surveys because it is a direct measure of the response burden. In this article, we analyze the effects of the survey design, respondent characteristics, and the interaction between these effects on interview duration. For that purpose, we applied multilevel analysis to a data set of 21 web surveys on political attitudes and behavior. Our results showed that factors on both levels, the individual and the survey level, had effects on interview duration. However, the larger share of the variation in interview duration is explained by the characteristics of the respondents. In this respect, we illustrate the impact of mobile devices and panel recruitment on interview duration. In addition, we found important relationships between the respondents' attitudes and how a web survey is designed: Highly motivated respondents spent significantly more time answering cognitively demanding questions than less motivated respondents. When planning a survey, not only the number and formats of questions need to be taken into account but also the expected sample composition and how the participants will respond to the design of the web survey.

AB  - Experience sampling or ecological momentary assessment offers unique insights into how people think, feel, and behave in their natural environments. Because the method is able to capture situational variation as it happens in real time, experience sampling has become an increasingly popular method in social and personality, psychology, and beyond. With the ubiquity of smartphone ownership and the recent technical advances, conducting experience sampling studies on participants' own devices has become increasingly easy to do. Here, we present one reliable, user-friendly, highly customizable, and cost-effective solution. The web-based application, SurveySignal, integrates the idea of using short message service (SMS) messages as signals and reminders, according to fixed or random schedules and of linking these signals to mobile surveys designed with common online survey software. We describe the method and customizable parameters and then present evaluation results from nine social-psychological studies conducted with SurveySignal (overall N = 1,852). Mean response rates averaged 77% and the median response delay to signals was 8 min. An experimental manipulation of the reminder signal in one study showed that installing a reminder SMS led to a 10% increase in response rates. Next to advantages and limitations of the SMS approach, we discuss how ecologically valid research methods such as smartphone experience sampling can enrich psychological research.

AB  - The present study investigates the role of process and social oriented smartphone usage, emotional intelligence, social stress, self-regulation, gender, and age in relation to habitual and addictive smartphone behavior. We conducted an online survey among 386 respondents. The results revealed that habitual smartphone use is an important contributor to addictive smartphone behavior. Process related smartphone use is a strong determinant for both developing habitual and addictive smartphone behavior. People who extensively use their smartphones for social purposes develop smartphone habits faster, which in turn might lead to addictive smartphone behavior. We did not find an influence of emotional intelligence on habitual or addictive smartphone behavior, while social stress positively influences addictive smartphone behavior, and a failure of self-regulation seems to cause a higher risk of addictive smartphone behavior. Finally, men experience less social stress than women, and use their smartphones less for social purposes. The result is that women have a higher chance in developing habitual or addictive smartphone behavior. Age negatively affects process and social usage, and social stress. There is a positive effect on self-regulation. Older people are therefore less likely to develop habitual or addictive smartphone behaviors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cyberpsychology is a recently emergent field that examines the impact of technology upon human cognition and behavior. Given its infancy, authors have rapidly created new measures to gauge their constructs of interest. Unfortunately, few of these authors have had the opportunity to test their scales' psychometric properties and validity. This is concerning, as many theoretical assumptions may be founded upon scales with inadequate attributes. If this were found to be true, then previous findings in cyberpsychology studies would need to be retested, and future research would need to shift its focus to creating psychometrically sound and valid measures. To provide inferences on this concern, the current study examines the article reporting, scale creation, and scale reliabilities of every article published in Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking from its inception to July 2014. The final data set encompassed the coding of 1,478 individual articles, including 921 scales, and spanning 17 years. The results demonstrate that the simple survey methodology has become more popular over time. Authors are gradually applying empirically tested scales. However, self-created measures are still the most popular, leading to concerns about the measures' validity. Also, the use of multi-item measures has increased over time, but many articles still fail to report adequate information to assess the reliability of the applied scales. Lastly, the average scale reliability is 0.81, which barely meets standard cutoffs. Overall, these results are not overly concerning, but suggestions are given on methods to improve the reporting of measures, the creation of scales, and the state of cyberpsychology.

AB  - Speed of exchange is important in communication using mobile phones. This study analyzes responses to a questionnaire survey of Japanese university students about replies to mobile text messages. Respondents were asked to indicate situations where a quick reply was desired and situations where a slow reply was acceptable. Free responses were classified broadly into seven groups such as "attributes of the other party," "one's own emotional state," "one's own situation," and "situation of the other party." Additionally, gender differences were seen in these free responses, with men more often referring to the attributes of the other party and their own situation and women more often referring to the content of the text messages. The results of the questions asking respondents to rank emotions by desired speed of response showed that there are individual differences in the relation between the type of emotion conveyed and the desired speed of reply (e.g., a quick reply was desired when joy or apology was conveyed). These individual differences were then aggregated into three types by cluster analysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Web surveys are becoming increasingly popular in survey research including stated preference surveys. Compared with face-to-face, telephone and mail surveys, web surveys may contain a different and new source of measurement error and bias: the type of device that respondents use to answer the survey questions. This is the first study that tests whether the use of mobile devices, tablets or smartphones, affects survey characteristics and stated preferences in a web-based choice experiment. The web survey on expanding renewable energy production in Germany was carried out with 3182 respondents, of which 12% used a mobile device. Propensity score matching is used to account for selection bias in the use of mobile devices for survey completion. We find that mobile device users spent more time than desktop/laptop users to answer the survey. Yet, desktop/laptop users and mobile device users do not differ in acquiescence tendency as an indicator of extreme response patterns. For mobile device users only, we find a negative correlation between screen size and interview length and a positive correlation between screen size and acquiescence tendency. In the choice experiment data, we do not find significant differences in the tendency to choose the status quo option and scale between both subsamples. However, some of the estimates of implicit prices differ, albeit not in a unidirectional fashion. Model results for mobile device users indicate a U-shaped relationship between error variance and screen size. Together, the results suggest that using mobile devices is not detrimental to survey quality. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to explore the roles of psychological attributes (such as shyness and loneliness) and smartphone usage patterns in predicting smartphone addiction symptoms and social capital. Data were gathered from a sample of 414 university students using online survey in Mainland China. Results from exploratory factor analysis identified five smartphone addiction symptoms: disregard of harmful consequences, preoccupation, inability to control craving, productivity loss, and feeling anxious and lost, which formed the Smartphone Addiction Scale. Results show that the higher one scored in loneliness and shyness, the higher the likelihood one would be addicted to smartphone. Furthermore, this study shows the most powerful predictor inversely affecting both bonding and bridging social capital was loneliness. Moreover, this study presents clear evidence that the use of smartphones for different purposes (especially for information seeking, sociability, and utility) and the exhibition of different addiction symptoms (such as preoccupation and feeling anxious and lost) significantly impacted social capital building. The significant links between smartphone addiction and smartphone usage, loneliness, and shyness have clear implications for treatment and intervention for parents, educators, and policy makers. Suggestions for future research are discussed.

AB  - This article presents and discusses three different approaches to the exploration of the cross-media challenges facing news audiences, as they seek access to, navigate in and make sense of the multitude of news sources across print, broadcasting, online and mobile media platforms. From a modernized uses and gratifications perspective, based on the notion of "worthwhileness" as the determinant of people's everyday selections from the "supermarket of news", the article first reports from a longitudinal survey study in Denmark in which the author's foundational mapping of cross-media news consumption in pre-mobile 2008 is compared with replicating mappings carried out in 2011 and 2012, in a collaborative project between academics and news publishers. The analytical interest here focuses on the fluctuations between traditional news media and the surging digital news outlets of the internet and mobile devices. Secondly, the article summarizes the findings of a qualitative study of citizens' news repertoires, which was fortified with a quantitative factor analysis in order to find patterns in people's news consumption. Thirdly, findings are presented from a 2013 study that explored ubiquitous news consumption, asking respondents to specify the nexus of news platform and location of use.

AB  - The number of mobile phone subscriptions worldwide reached almost 7 billion in 2013. Therefore, the social and psychological consequences of the technology are of great interest to new media scholars and policy makers. Adopting an affordance-based approach, this study examines how different uses of the mobile phone are related to individuals' subjective well-being and social capital. Findings from a national survey showed that both voice and online communication with the mobile phone is positively related to various indicators of subjective well-being and bonding and bridging capital. Moreover, both bonding and bridging capital mediated the relationship between mobile phone use and subjective well-being. On the other hand, non-communicative uses, such as information seeking activities, were negatively related to positive affect and passing time activities were positively related to negative affect. Implications of the findings are discussed.

AB  - This study examines enterprise mobile applications (EMA) to explain how creative job performance is revealed from both the habitual use and task-technology fit for EMA, while also considering the moderating effect of organizational agility. Based on a large-scale survey from employees who use EMA in their workplace across industries, our results suggest that the impact of EMA on perceived job performance and creativity as creativity-supporting systems (in terms of both the habitual use and task-technology fit for EMA) is positive and significant. Our results indicate the positive moderating effect of organizational agility on the relationship between task-technology fit for EMA and perceived job performance. We also identify task-(mobility and feedback) and technology-(reliability, accessibility, and overall quality) characteristics that are found to be positively associated with task-technology fit for EMA. Further, we find that external factors, such as perceived critical mass and the reputation of EMA, can more efficiently explain the habitual use of EMA than internal factors, such as trust and self-efficacy for EMA. The present findings enable researchers and practitioners to understand the role of EMA, which facilitates organizational workers' creative work processes, as well as it inspires the exploration of digital creativity in the workplace.

KW  - DESIGN
AB  - With the introduction of new depth-sensing technologies, interactive hand-gesture devices (such as smart televisions and displays) have been rapidly emerging. However, given the lack of a common vocabulary, most hand-gesture control commands are device-specific, burdening the user into learning different vocabularies for different devices. In order for hand gestures to become a natural communication for users with interactive devices, a standardized interactive hand-gesture vocabulary is necessary. Recently, researchers have approached this issue by conducting studies that elicit gesture vocabularies based on users' preferences. Nonetheless, a universal vocabulary has yet to be proposed. In this paper, a thorough design methodology for achieving such a universal hand-gesture vocabulary is presented. The methodology is derived from the work of Wobbrock et al. and includes four steps: 1) a preliminary survey eliciting users' attitudes; 2) a broader user survey in order to construct the universal vocabulary via results of the preliminary survey; 3) an evaluation test to study the implementation of the vocabulary; and 4) a memory test to analyze the memorability of the vocabulary. The proposed vocabulary emerged from this methodology achieves an agreement score exceeding those of the existing studies. Moreover, the results of the memory test show that, within a 15-min training session, the average accuracy of the proposed vocabulary is 90.71%. Despite the size of the proposed gesture vocabulary being smaller than that of similar work, it shares the same functionality, is easier to remember and can be integrated with smart TVs, interactive digital displays, and so on.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the continued usage of mobile instant messaging (IM) from the perspectives of both motivators and inhibitors.
   Design/methodology/approach - To cast light on the motivators and inhibitors of continuance intention (CI) to use mobile IM, 268 responses from Chinese mobile IM users were collected via an online survey.
   Findings - The results suggest that perceived system quality, procedural switching cost and relational switching cost (RSC) positively affect resistance to change (RTC), while perceived user base, perceived quality of communication, RSC and RTC positively affect the CI. Among them, RTC has the greatest effect on the CI, and RSC has the largest effect on RTC.
   Originality/value - Extant research has mainly focussed on the motivators behind the continued usage of mobile services. However, the inhibitors, such as switching cost and RTC, have been less considered in the research on the continued usage of mobile services. Also, only a little research has examined the components of switching costs and how they affect the intention to continue using mobile services. The current study attempts to fill these research gaps.

AB  - While many reports predict huge growth potential for the mobile application (app) market, little is known about user intention to purchase paid apps. This study amends the expectation confirmation model and incorporates app rating, free alternatives to paid apps and habit as belief-related constructs to predict user behavior. The proposed model was empirically evaluated using a survey of 507 respondents about their perceptions of app usage. The results indicated that confirmation was positively related to perceived value and satisfaction. Value-for-money, app rating and free alternatives to paid apps were found to have a direct impact on intention to purchase paid apps. Specifically, there was a significant difference between potential users and actual users. The results may provide further insights into app marketing strategies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This research empirically tested cultural differences in the relationship between the components of unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) and trust. Using an online survey to collect data from mobile phone service users in Korea and the USA, we found two meaningful outcomes that may improve the understanding of technology acceptance behaviour. First, trust in smartphones significantly increased usage intentions, whereas trust formation was affected by users' expectancy of both performance and effort. Second, the relationship between the proposed UTAUT model constructs differed between the two countries. These findings indicate that trust in technological artefacts plays an important role in explaining technology adoption, and that culture may moderate the extent to which the antecedents of the technology acceptance model affect trust and usage intentions. Implications for practitioners are discussed, and suggestions for future research are provided.

AB  - The widespread use of mobile devices is leading towards their adoption in the learning process, even if some pedagogical challenges are still not fully addressed when integrating mobile-assisted activities into regular curricula activities. In this paper, we first define some guidelines to design a general, tailorable, and platform-independent mobile learning system. Second, we present the aCME system, a mobile infrastructure, developed by adhering to the defined guidelines, to provide a general-purpose system, easy to start up with and friendly to user, and finally, tailorable, i.e., that can be easily adapted to the needs of different learning environments. The aCME system has been implemented as a Web-based architecture, to provide content and functionalities for different contexts, accessible from any location and by using any communication device. Finally, we describe a tool, deployed into aCME, that allows responding to quiz-based questionnaires during learning activities. A preliminary evaluation was performed to analyze usability and user satisfaction when interacting with the system we developed. The paper is concluded with some comments and future research directions.

AB  - A review of popular technology adoption models identified several factors that are likely to influence Voice Activated Personal Assistant (VAPA) use in public spaces. To inform design decisions of how to make the private use of the VAPA in public spaces more acceptable from the users' point of view, an online survey was conducted to investigate the likelihood of usage of the smartphone VAPA such as Apple's Siri (compared to the usage of smartphone keyboard) as a function of location (private vs. public) and type of information (private vs. nonprivate). Responses from participants showed that users were more cautious of transmitting private than nonprivate information. This effect of type of information was amplified in the social context of public locations and when using conspicuous methods of information input such as the VAPA. Participants also preferred using the VAPA in private locations and showed no preference of location for keyboard entries. Correlations between likelihood of usage of VAPA and the social acceptability ratings were positive and predicted similar patterns of smartphone usage.

AB  - By their nature, smartphones must have small screens, and that is one of their limitations. Many users have trouble reading information on the Internet on such small screens because Internet browsers are usually designed for computers that have larger screens than smartphones. This study evaluates the usability of alternative user interfaces when reading news articles on smartphones. An experiment was conducted involving 120 smartphone users who were asked to evaluate six types of user interfaces based on three methods (pop-up, full-screen, and auto-zooming) and two display orientations (horizontal, vertical) in one of two languages (English and Persian). The participants were assigned four typical tasks that users must perform to obtain information from the Internet, that is, finding, refinding, reading, and browsing; they were asked to conduct the tasks in random order. In addition, a questionnaire was used to measure the efficiency and effectiveness of the participants' completion of the tasks, as well as their satisfaction, compatibility, and enjoyment of the undertakings. The results indicated that method, orientation, and language affected the actual usage and the time used. Based on the human factor experiment, the full-screen method was preferred in refinding and reading, whereas the pop-up method was preferred in browsing and finding. In terms of orientation, the vertical mode was preferred, and each user's performance in the vertical mode was better in all tasks except browsing. Of interest, using the English language turned out to be more satisfying, enjoyable, and efficient to the Persian users who did the experiment in English as their second language.

AB  - Survey completions on mobile devices have been increasing rapidly. This important shift is something market researchers should definitely consider when designing and conducting self-administered online surveys. This article briefly summarises existing research and empirical results from mobile surveys. Based on the specific findings discussed, market researchers should be better aware of what to expect when fielding surveys completed by mobile respondents, whether this is intended or not. Bringing the findings together and discussing more broadly, for online surveys, market researchers should consider consciously and deliberately accommodating both mobile and PC respondents. Thus far, the research on mobile surveys indicates that consumers want the choice and ability to take surveys when they want, where they want and on the device of their choosing. It is to be hoped that market researchers are listening and become willing to accommodate survey respondents in terms of device and, by extension, time and location.

AB  - Legacy news media have invested substantially in developing digital and mobile news provisioning, alongside the widespread diffusion of information and communication technologies. Amid these developments, many people have shifted the ways they access the news in everyday life, with mobile devices gaining much significance. This has shifted the roles traditionally played by newspapers, television stations, radio broadcasters and news sites, ultimately relating to their democratic functions and the diminishing effect of their business models. This article will describe and explain displacing vis-a-vis complementary effects among age cohorts. It shows how the recent uptake of mobile devices has influenced news consumption via newspapers and news sites. It investigates three research questions, each focusing age cohorts in relation to singlemedia use, cross-media use, and nonuse. The article presents a statistical analysis of datasets nationally representative to Sweden and the specific case of evening tabloids. The data used originate from scientific omnibus survey projects conducted annually from 1986 to 2012 at the University of Gothenburg. The findings show that the public generally engage in single-media rather than cross-media news consumption, whereas age cohorts have developed divergent forms of single-media use: (a) the 1930s and 1940s age cohort are primarily single-media users in print, (b) the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s age cohorts are computer-oriented single-media users; and (c) the 1980s and 1990s age cohorts are mainly single-media users via mobile devices, but also cross-media users of mobile devices combined with a computer. As of 2012, the uptake of mobile news and cross-media news consumption reached new records, whereas the single-media use of printed newspapers reached a new low. The integrated theoretical framework proves useful for comprehending such transforming news consumption among age cohorts, and reveals the significance for legacy news media to explore and exploit the opportunities arising from mobile devices and tablets.

AB  - Mobile devices allow users to keep ubiquitously connected to the internet. Consequently, they change the reception of information by faster access, greater timeliness, and new media usage contexts. At the same time, many traditional media organizations already produce content for mobile websites and apps in line with cross-media strategies. Reflecting severe structural changes in the journalism market, they are hoping to manage the digital transition successfully by mobile publishing, (re) gaining especially the digital natives. Referring to the media repertoire approach, we examine the role of mobile devices on two different levels. First, from a technical point of view, we consider the platform repertoire of mobile internet users for information. Focusing on the use frequency of online (computer, mobile devices) and offline media (printed newspaper, television set, radio set), a quantitative study (N = 498, face-to-face interviews) reveals six different user types. Second, we examine the new medium's use for information purposes by drawing on the unique specifics of mobile devices compared to other media. Results show that the new medium is frequently used for information due to its particular qualities. Third, we look at the users' selected mobile news sources from an institutional perspective. Our results indicate that, although new online-only providers are of a certain relevance to mobile internet users, traditional journalism's content dominates the mobile information repertoire.

AB  - This paper examines recent acclaim for professional embedded photojournalists who visually document the experience of US soldiers in Afghanistan using the popular mobile photo application Hipstamatic. These photos have stirred controversy among fellow journalists and cultural critics regarding the use of photo filters in Hipstamatic and similar app Instagram, their contribution to the de-professionalization of photojournalism, and the depiction of war as stylishly vintage. The debates about Hipstamatic and Instagram in war photography open up a whole series of enduring questions about distinctions between photography and illustration, photography and photojournalism, professional and amateur, and reporting and editorializing. In consideration of the shifting nature of digital photography, photojournalism, and specifically war photojournalism, I argue that this discourse about the use of mobile apps overlooks another important ethical issue: the implications of non-soldiers mimicking the imagined hand of the modern smartphone-equipped US soldier, particularly in light of soldiers' own complex media-making practices.

AB  - This research note presents the results of an experiment that investigated how response rates and data quality could be improved for smartphone web surveys. First, we compare how invitations by text message versus by e-mail affect response rate. Text message invitations result in a similar total response rate as e-mail invitations when considering response via all types of online devices. When considering response via smartphones only, the survey completion rate is significantly higher. The text message contact mode also leads to a faster speed of initial response. Second, we examine the response effects of several questionnaire-design choices when using smartphones: paging versus scrolling, horizontal versus vertical question layout, number of answer options, and open-ended versus closed-ended questions. According to our findings, a scrolling layout leads to a shorter completion time than a paging layout. We further suggest that caution be used with horizontal and long-answer scales as well as open-ended text answer fields in smartphone surveys.

AB  - This article investigates unintended mobile access to surveys in online, probability-based panels. We find that spontaneous tablet usage is drastically increasing in web surveys, while smartphone usage remains low. Further, we analyze the bias of respondent profiles using smartphones and tablets compared to those using computers, on the basis of several sociodemographic characteristics. Our results indicate not only that mobile web respondents differ from PC users but also that tablet users differ from smartphone users. While tablets are used for survey completion by working (young) adults, smartphones are used merely by the young. In addition, our results indicate that mobile web respondents are more progressive and describe themselves more often as pioneers or forerunners in adopting new technology, compared to PC respondents. We further discover that respondents' preferences for devices to complete surveys are clearly in line with unintended mobile response. Finally, we present a similar analysis on intended mobile response in an experiment where smartphone users were requested to complete a mobile survey. Based on these findings, testing on tablets is strongly recommended in online surveys. If the goal is to reach young respondents, enabling surveys via smartphones should be considered.

AB  - This paper examines the effect of the freemium strategy on Google Play, an online marketplace for Android mobile applications. By analyzing a large panel data set consisting of 711 ranked mobile apps, we found that the freemium strategy is positively associated with increased sales of the paid mobile apps. Positive trial experience as represented by high review rating of the free version of a mobile app leads to higher sales of its paid version, whereas high visibility of the free version of a mobile app as represented by its product rank does not have a significant impact on the sales of its paid version. This finding suggests that although offering a free trial version is a viable way to improve the visibility of a mobile app, offering a quality free app is more important in boosting sales of the paid app. Moreover, we found that the impact of review rating is reduced when the free version is offered, or when the mobile app is a hedonic app, because consumers have the ability to experience the app themselves before purchase. These findings extend understanding of the freemium business model to include a market characterized by simultaneous intra-market competition for both the freemium and paid products and demonstrate how such dynamics may influence sales of the paid products.

KW  - Data collection
KW  - MEDIA
AB  - Nearly 6000 adults from 7 countries participated in an online survey about what other activities they engaged in while taking the survey and how distracted they felt. Younger people were more likely than older ones to engage in electronic and non-electronic multitasking. Engaging in a wider range of tasks was associated with feeling more distracted. However, once the variety of tasks was taken into account, interruptions associated with checking or talking on one's phone made participants feel less distracted. The relationship between age, multitasking, and feeling distraction was curvilinear, with middle-aged respondents being more affected by multitasking than either younger or older survey takers. The findings suggest that people of all ages are often deliberate multitaskers who choose their distractions intentionally, at least some of the time. This bodes well for researchers seeking to administer online surveys, because it suggests that survey takers will set themselves up with the type and amount of distractions they are comfortable with. The finding that a high degree of electronic multitasking may decrease the perception of distraction should be followed by experiments verifying if this perception corresponds to actual task performance.

AB  - The advent of online games, crowdsourcing, and user-generated content has led to the emergence of a new paradigm called the Human Computation Games (HCGs) which utilize games as a motivator to encourage users' participation in human computation. HCGs are different from games for pure entertainment which emphasize play and fun, rather than output generation. Therefore, research has yet to fully explore the factors underlying players' perception of HCG enjoyment. In this paper, we study the influence of motivational needs satisfaction and perceived output quality on perceived HCG enjoyment using a survey (N = 205) of a location-based information sharing HCG called SPLASH, developed as part of our research. According to the results, perceived needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness influence perceived enjoyment of HCGs, suggesting that HCGs that fulfill these three needs are more likely to be enjoyable, thereby encouraging players to make useful computations. The results also show that participants who perceive higher levels output relevancy report a greater level of enjoyment, indicating that HCGs that assist players in generating relevant outputs are more likely to be perceived as enjoyable.

AB  - The study aims to explore effects of navigational augmented reality (AR) apps on the users' perception of their surroundings, and to analyze in which ways these effects are enabled as well as limited by the performance of AR apps on currently available devices. To answer these questions, an exploratory quasi-experiment has been conducted, consisting of three groups of participants, each group differing in their method for obtaining location information as well as the frequency with which this information is consumed. Semistructured pre- and postexperiment interviews with participants, questionnaires that were filled out by the participants after every app usage, and expert interviews with navigational AR app developers are employed in combination with analyzing the effect of augmented reality on the user's perception of space. Surprisingly, it was found that AR users actually became less aware of their surroundings than non-AR navigational app users. This is mainly due to the comparatively worse performance of AR apps on currently available smartphones: The overall quality regularly suffers from a cluttered and confusing presentation, leading to considerable amounts of time spent "deciphering" the layout and functionality of the presented results. Erratic result behavior, caused by frequent movement delays and unexpected lag of the virtual objects further decreases the quality of the overall experience. Finally, some initially unexpected issues related to the social acceptability of augmented reality app usage in public places were encountered during the experiment, which are explained by the physically very involved method of interacting with AR apps, namely having to point and hold the device into the direction information is being sought over. Nevertheless, augmented reality was found to have a number of distinct advantages over other navigational apps, namely the ability to improve the users' understanding of proximity, directions, and spatial relations.

AB  - Psychological factors and social relationships are important components that influence an individual's communication style. This paper aims to examine the association of personality factors, social anxiety (SA) and loneliness with mobile phone (MP) usage preferences on the basis of voice calling and text messaging. Malaysian MP users (N = 187) completed four questionnaires (Mobile Phone Usage Questionnaire, Big Five Inventory, Interaction Anxiousness Scale and UCLA Loneliness Scale) on paper or online via a web-link. Multiple regression analyses revealed that personality, SA and loneliness broadly predicted preferences for voice calling or text messaging. Further analyses examining the predictability of time spent on voice calls/text messaging and number of people called/exchanged text messages also revealed some significant findings in regards to the openness-to-experience personality dimension, loneliness and SA. The findings of this research have important implications to tailoring the delivery of psychological services to individuals diagnosed with chronic loneliness and SA.

AB  - Lectures are designed to deliver new information to a large group of students. Apart from actual lecturing, lecturers may also encourage elaboration of learning material with advanced instructions, like advance organizer, summaries and repetitions as well as questions. Prerequisite to learning from lectures is that students focus on the lecture and cognitively process what is being presented. In today's lectures, mobile devices, (i.e. laptops and smartphones), may aid students to research additional information online or to take notes, but may also distract students. In this descriptive study, 86 students with 91 mobile devices out of five lectures were observed with respect to how they utilized mobile devices for lecture-related and -unrelated activities. Additionally, we observed 21 lecturers and coded their behavior. The results indicate that lecturing correlates only slightly with student activities. Students use media mostly in a lecture-unrelated way. Giving negative feedback seems to foster students' lecture-unrelated media use. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper assesses how use of smartphones relates to exposure to heterogeneity, political efficacy, and political engagement and suggests a new mediation model that can be applied to mobile communication. Drawing on online survey data collected during the 2012 presidential election in South Korea, this study finds that exposure to heterogeneity and political efficacy jointly mediate the impact of informational uses of smartphones on political participation. The current study also shows that informational uses of smartphones are significantly related to encounters with heterogeneity, political efficacy, and participatory behaviors. Additionally, recreational uses of smartphones were found to have a positive association with exposure to heterogeneity. However, relational uses of smartphones were not associated with democratic outcomes. The findings suggest that smartphones, by increasing the possibility of encountering diversity and subsequently enhancing political efficacy, create an additional pathway to citizen engagement in democratic processes.

AB  - This article reports from a pilot study that was conducted in a probability-based online panel in the Netherlands. Two parallel surveys were conducted: one in the traditional questionnaire layout of the panel and the other optimized for mobile completion with new software that uses a responsive design (optimizes the layout for the device chosen). The latter questionnaire was optimized for mobile completion, and respondents could choose whether they wanted to complete the survey on their mobile phone or on a regular desktop. Results show that a substantive number of respondents (57%) used their mobile phone for survey completion. No differences were found between mobile and desktop users with regard to break offs, item nonresponse, time to complete the survey, or response effects such as length of answers to an open-ended question and the number of responses in a check-all-that-apply question. A considerable number of respondents gave permission to record their GPS coordinates, which are helpful in defining where the survey was taken. Income, household size, and household composition were found to predict mobile completion. In addition, younger respondents, who typically form a hard-to-reach group, show higher mobile completion rates.

This impact may be direct (e.g., an academic article may be adapted to solve a practical problem) or indirect (e.g., its contents may be incorporated into practitioners' tools, which then influence marketing decision making). We use the term "marketing science value chain" to describe these diffusion steps, and survey marketing managers, marketing science intermediaries (practicing marketing analysts), and marketing academics to calibrate the value chain. In our sample, we find that (1) the impact of marketing science is perceived to be largest on decisions such as the management of brands, pricing, new products, product portfolios, and customer/market selection, and (2) tools such as segmentation, survey-based choice models, marketing mix models, and pre-test market models have the largest impact on marketing decisions. Exemplary papers from 1982 to 2003 that achieved dual - academic and practice - impact are Guadagni and Little (1983) and Green and Srinivasan (1990). Overall, our results are encouraging. First, we find that the impact of marketing science has been largest on marketing decision areas that are important to practice. Second, we find moderate alignment between academic impact and practice impact. Third, we identify antecedents of practice impact among dual impact marketing science papers. Fourth, we discover more recent trends and initiatives in the period 2004-2012, such as the increased importance of big data and the rise of digital and mobile communication, using the marketing science value chain as an organizing framework.

TI  - What is interactivity for? The social dimension of web-documentary participation
T2  - CONTINUUM-JOURNAL OF MEDIA & CULTURAL STUDIES
LA  - English
KW  - VOICE
AB  - Documentary has been so closely associated with the mediums of film and television that the emergence of new forms of documentary, made for computerized mediums such as the Internet, mobile phones and tablets appear fundamentally transformative. The potential for audiences to interact with documentary in various ways is at the heart of what makes these new modes of documentary distinctive; audiences are potentially able to engage in a range of practices from navigating virtual environments, to choosing video content from a database, taking part in 'chat' sessions and creating content. Engaging theoretically with these emerging audience practices raises questions about authorship and the social impact of documentary. In this paper, interactivity and participation are considered from a social perspective. It is suggested that there is a need to distinguish between user actions that impact on the documentary text and the ability of users to engage with others through documentary. The concept of documentary voice is interrogated to reveal two distinct dimensions: voice-as-authorship and voice-as-social participation. Drawing on documentary and digital media scholarship, this paper explores the social functions of documentary interactivity and participation with reference to a range of web-documentary examples.

AB  - The dual pathway model proposes that trait body dissatisfaction leads to bulimic symptoms via two distinct pathways: dieting and trait negative affect As many of these modelled variables have state-based equivalents, the present study evaluated the generalisability of this model to predict associations between state body dissatisfaction and instances of disordered eating. 124 women aged 18 to 40 years completed an online survey (accessed via a mobile phone device with web access) over a 7-day period. The mobile phone device prompted participants at random intervals seven times daily to self-report their state body dissatisfaction, current mood experiences, dieting attempts, and disordered eating practices. Multi-level mediation modelling revealed that both negative mood states and dieting significantly mediated the state body dissatisfaction-disordered eating relationships, although the strength of these associations depended on the aspect of disordered eating measured and individual differences in trait body dissatisfaction, internalization of appearance standards, tendency towards dieting, and BMI. Collectively, these results not only support adapting the dual pathway model to the state-level, but also suggest that several of the model implied pathways may be more relevant for individuals with more pathological eating- and body-related concerns and behaviours.

AB  - Media significantly shape how and what we learn. To date there is limited understanding of digital media and information use by engineering students. We comprehensively review existing literature and present findings from a research study investigating digital media and information use of 'millennial' engineers who purportedly possess distinctive experience, habits, and perceptions about technology. We administered a multiple-item survey to a cohort of first year engineering students who entered a large public university in the United States in August 2009. Self-reported information on the frequency of media device usage, participation in social networking, academic activities and information seeking tendencies, was received from 204 participants. Similar to other youth, millennial engineers use technology extensively and are frequent users of both commonly used digital devices as well as applications. Students' device ownership was marked by a relatively low use of desktop computers and significant use of mobile devices. Students reported using the Internet extensively for both entertainment and school related work. Facebook (TM) use was common but Twitter (TM) use was limited. Multitasking was common and its self-reported effectiveness varied across participants. Gender differences were found across several items. Implications for teaching and learning are discussed.

AB  - This study sought to overcome some of the methodological limitations in previous studies and clarify the role of attachment in the associations between texting and romantic relationship satisfaction. Specifically, a new, relative measure of texting usage was created to estimate the share of texting in communication compared to other channels (e.g., face-to-face, phone, and etc.), in addition to using the traditional, absolute measure of texting usage (i.e., the number of texts sent to partners). A sample of 395 participants completed an online survey regarding texting behavior. Background variables were controlled for in all analyses, particularly the physical distance between partners, which was often overlooked in previous research. The results suggested that texting share showed positive links with both attachment dimensions and a negative link with relationship satisfaction, whereas the sheer volume of texts had little association with attachment dimensions or satisfaction.

AB  - The dramatic rise of smartphones has profound implications for survey research. Namely, can smartphones become a viable and comparable device for self-administered surveys? The current study is based on approximately 1,500 online U.S. panelists who were smartphone users and who were randomly assigned to the mobile app or online computer mode of a survey. Within the survey, we embedded several experiments that had been previously tested in other modes (mail, PC web, mobile web). First, we test whether responses in the mobile app survey are sensitive to particular experimental manipulations as they are in other modes. Second, we test whether responses collected in the mobile app survey are similar to those collected in the online computer survey. Our mobile survey experiments show that mobile survey responses are sensitive to the presentation of frequency scales and the size of open-ended text boxes, as are responses in other survey modes. Examining responses across modes, we find very limited evidence for mode effects between mobile app and PC web survey administrations. This may open the possibility for multimode (mobile and online computer) surveys, assuming that certain survey design recommendations for mobile surveys are used consistently in both modes.

AB  - The current study examines general text messaging tendencies, patterns of and reasons for texting family members, and the impact of texting on familial relationships among a young U.S. adult sample. Participants were recruited through Facebook; they then completed an online questionnaire. Data from 127 young adults (men: 38; women: 87; unidentified: 2) are analyzed and compared by gender. Findings suggest that young adults text at high rates per month. Participants generally report a prompt response to texts and their ability to honestly express feelings within these messages. Results also suggest participants text family members for a variety of reasons, such as to convey information, plan activities, and engage in general conversation. Distinct gender differences, however, are evident regarding who men and women text as well as texting's effects on familial relationships. Overall, these findings expand researchers' understanding of texting in general and its impact within the family. (C) 2013 Western Social Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This paper introduces a new perspective on information behavior in Web 2.0 environments, including the role of mobile access in bridging formal to informal learning. Kuhlthau's (1991, 2007) Information Search Process (ISP) model is identified as a theoretical basis for exploring Information Seeking attitudes and behaviors, while social learning and literacy concepts of Vygotsky (1962, 1978), Bruner (1962, 1964) and Jenkins (2010) are identified as foundations for Information Sharing. The Guided Inquiry Spaces model (Maniotes, 2005) is proposed as an approach to bridging the student's informal learning world and the curriculum-based teacher's world. Research within this framework is operationalized through a recently validated Information and Communications Technology Learning (ICTL) survey instrument measuring learners' preferences for self-expression, sharing, and knowledge acquisition interactions in technology-pervasive environments. Stepwise refinement of ICTL produced two reliable and valid psychometric scales, Information Sharing (alpha = .77) and Information Seeking (alpha = .72). Cross-validation with an established Mobile Learning Scale (Khaddage & Knezek, 2013) indicates that Information Sharing aligns significantly (p < .05) with Mobile Learning, Information Seeking, Information Sharing, and mobile access are presented as important, complimentary components important, complimentary components in the shift along the formal to informal learning continuum. Therefore, measures of these constructs can assist in understanding students' preferences for 21st century learning. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many psychological processes unfold over time, necessitating longitudinal research designs. Longitudinal research poses a host of methodological challenges, foremost of which is participant attrition. Building on Dillman's work, we provide a review of how social influence and relationship research informs retention strategies in longitudinal studies. Objective: We introduce the tailored panel management (TPM) approach, which is designed to establish communal norms that increase commitment to a longitudinal study, and this commitment, in turn, increases response rates and buffers against attrition. Specifically, we discuss practices regarding compensation, communication, consistency, and credibility that increase longer term commitment to panel participation. Research design: Throughout the article, we describe how TPM is being used in a national longitudinal study of undergraduate minority science students. TheScienceStudy is a continuing panel, which has 12 waves of data collected across 6 academic years, with response rates ranging from 70% to 92%. Although more than 90% of participants have either left or graduated from their undergraduate degree program, this highly mobile group of people remains engaged in the study. TheScienceStudy has usable longitudinal data from 96% of the original panel. Conclusion: This article combines social psychological theory, current best practice, and a detailed case study to illustrate the TPM approach to longitudinal data collection. The approach provides guidance for other longitudinal researchers, and advocates for empirical research into longitudinal research methodologies.

AB  - This study seeks to assess the implications of the social use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) for online political participation. Past research investigating the link between ICTs and political participation has emphasized the informational use of ICTs, overlooking their communication-enabling potentials for facilitating political talk in interpersonal spaces and subsequently, political participation in public domains. To understand further how ICTs as a means of communication may relate to political participation, we use data from the 2008 Taiwan Social Change Survey (N=1076) to examine the relationship between the Internet and online political participation by looking at online media use for social interaction and engagement in civic talk online. Our findings suggest that interpersonal factors such as online civic talk and media multiplexity are positively associated with online political participation. Individuals who discuss politics with their friends via the Internet and those who use more types of online media for social interaction are more likely to contact legislators and elected officials directly via the Web and articulate their political thoughts in online public spaces such as forums, blogs, and websites of news media. We further offer an assessment of the findings' implications for political participation, political communication, and digital inequality.

AB  - This research cross-employed the social cognition theory (SCT) and the analytical network process (ANP) model in qualitative analyses and the multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) methodology in quantitative measurements to comprehensively re-identify the most critical information communication technology (ICT) determinants in minimizing the digital divide (DD). After measuring the complete importance of related priority weight w (eigenvector) from the survey results given to various experts, the complete synthetically comparative index numbers (SCIN) from the evaluation model used conveyed two distinct consequences. First, the highest SCIN scores for the ANP, F-ANP, and G-ANP models are 0.5516, 0.3771, and 0.4791, respectively, and are located in the "ICT can positively minimize the level of DD" (ICTCPMDD) column in the summarized results table. Secondly, the highest evaluated weighted score of assessed criteria of 0.5801 is located in the Diversified Mobile Applications (DMAPP) column. From these results, there are two contributive findings that can be deduced. First, ICT indeed proved the determinative influences and interplays in the level of DD which means that the undeveloped, developing, and emerging regions are apparently able to minimize the level of DD by means of the ICT development. Second, the Diversified Mobile Applications (DMAPP) is the most critical determinant of ICT in minimizing the level of digital divide.

AB  - The current study examined how task performance enhancement, easiness, important others' opinions, entertainment motivation, information seeking motivation, and social connection motivation would predict use intention of mobile applications. Based on a motivational communication theory and the technology acceptance model, a web-based survey was administered among mobile application users. The results of hypothesised model testing show that easiness is the key factor influencing continuance intention of mobile application use. In addition, this study reveals that mobile application users consider human connection and social utility to be more important than entertainment in creating task performance, easiness, social influence, and use intention. This study combined motivations with technology adoption factors for mobile application use in an integrated model. This theoretical attempt strengthened the explanatory power of the technology adoption model for mobile application use. Mobile application vendors and developers must consider the user friendliness of their applications and how many purposes they satisfy.

AB  - This study examines mobile divide by gender, age, social economic status (SES), and social capital using a conceptual model of mobile divide. This model is composed of eight components of mobile divide which are divided into the following three groups: two antecedents of mobile use including innovativeness and competence, two types of actual mobile use (talk and non-talk), and consequences of mobile use including life management, resource use, network management, and personal identity display. Through a survey of 400 mobile users in Korea, our study verified the validity of the proposed model. In addition, this model enables us to examine mobile divide in two different approaches - at the level of each component and in the relations among the components. Mobile divides by gender, age, SES, and social capital existed at the level of various components. Age and SES even showed significant mobile divides in the relations between mobile uses and consequence-related components. Implications of the results in our study along with the two types of approaches to mobile divide are discussed.

AB  - This study examines the effects of online gossip propensity in social networking sites (SNSs). We posit that online gossip propensity affects SNS identification, which in turn determines normative pressure and SNS engagement. The ultimate outcome is electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) intention. We also explore the impact of two types of SNS communication channel, i.e. handheld (mobile devices and tablets) and traditional (desktop PCs and laptops) computing devices. The data were collected from a questionnaire survey with 400 general consumers. Using a scenario approach, we asked the respondents how they would react to a special discount campaign for a popular beer brand ad posted on an SNS. Our structural equation modelling results indicate that online gossip propensity is indeed a significant driver of SNS identification. All hypothesised paths are supported, except the one from normative pressure to eWOM intention. Furthermore, SNS communication channels had a clear impact, since the latent means are greater for most of the constructs in the handheld computing device group than in the traditional computing device group.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper are twofold: first, develop a novel concept of a mobiquitous home application (Near Field Communication Smartphone Entertainment Systems (NFC SES)) with the use of photo interface and NFC smartphone. Second, examine age-group differences in relation to the influence of intuitive, convenience and perceived usefulness on users' behavioural intention to use NFC SFS.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using design science research, NFC SES is developed and a survey of 52 users is conducted to evaluate NFC SES.
   Findings - There are age differences in individual behavioural intention to use NFC technology. Convenience appears to be the primary factor for the youths. The adult cohort, in contrast emphasizes intuitive and perceived usefulness as two significant determinants of their behavioural intention to use NFC SES.
   Practical implications - This study offers a fresh insight for mobile device manufacturer and application developers to focus their design efforts around three aspects (intuitive, convenience and usefulness) that are desired by different age-group users.
   Social implications - The development of NFC SES bridges the gap of cyber-physical spaces by enabling users to automate multiple heterogeneous digital appliances without imposing undue technological effort and inconvenience. NFC SES, operating through a touch-driven interaction between NFC smartphone and photo interface, is likely to be useful for many home users, especially for people with disabilities.
   Originality/value - NFC SES contributes in itself as a novel innovation. Additionally, studies on mobile technology largely focus on students as users, and often neglect the adult segment. This study entails a new model for evaluation of NFC technology, by uncovering age differences impacts on new technology adoption.

AB  - This study performs comparative and longitudinal analyses of the domestic and overseas consumption (measured by time-spent-reading and popularity) of UK national newspaper brands across their print editions and online channels (excluding mobile "apps"). The study estimates that, in 2011, a minimum of 96.7 per cent of the time spent with newspapers by their domestic audience was in print, with "popular/tabloid" titles least successful in capturing audience attention online. In terms of popularity, the print channel accounted for a majority of domestic daily readers: in 2011 the newspapers studied had an estimated average daily readership per print copy of 2,110,633. By contrast, the average number of online sessions per day was estimated to be between 385,156 and 709,559. Nearly half the newspapers may have increased their aggregated domestic print and online popularity between 2007 and 2011, although those increases have not translated-with one exception-into increases in time spent with those brands. The online channel has increased newspapers' daily overseas audience by between 7 and 16 times. However, because those online readers' visits are relatively brief, the effect on the attention newspapers receive (measured in time) from overseas has been minimal. In fact, two-thirds of the newspapers for which the most recent data were available suffered decreases in the time their overseas readers spent with their print and online channels between 2008/9 and 2011.

AB  - Australian drivers' use of hand-held mobile phones is increasing in prevalence, despite the illegal nature of this behaviour. Research investigating the psychosocial influences on drivers' intentions to use hand-held mobile phones is limited. The present research utilised the theory of planned behaviour, extended with descriptive norm, to investigate the psychosocial influences on drivers' intentions to use a hand-held mobile phone. The behaviours associated with mobile phone use were categorised into initiating and responding behaviour. Answering calls and reading text messages were categorised as responding behaviour, on the basis that these two behaviours have been associated with social pressure to respond. Making calls and sending text messages were categorised as initiating behaviour. A sample of 181 drivers from the general population, aged 18-66 years, completed an online survey. The survey assessed attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control, descriptive norm, past behaviour and intention, in relation to initiating and responding behaviour. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control and descriptive norm were all significant predictors of drivers' intentions to engage in both initiating and responding behaviour. However, drivers reported significantly greater intentions to engage in responding behaviour and reported engaging in responding behaviour more frequently than initiating behaviour, indicating that social pressure to respond may play an important role in drivers' illegal use of hand-held mobile phones.

AB  - Ecological momentary assessment (EMA), or the repeated assessment of individuals' behaviors and experiences over time, is a methodologically advantageous approach to the study of psychological constructs. Recently, advances in computer technology have allowed for EMA research to be conducted in a more convenient, automated, and secure manner by administering surveys on participants' telephones and storing the results directly to a central server. The present article introduces TelEMA, an easy-to-use, low-cost telephone assessment platform for clinical and research applications. A single server running TelEMA can be shared among many experimenters, studies, and participants simultaneously. TelEMA routes telephone calls and text messages through a third-party service, so experimenters may conduct studies with no up-front cost or technical expertise. TelEMA provides a secure Web interface for experimenters or clinicians to design studies, enroll participants, monitor compliance, and collate response data from anywhere. Participants complete surveys using their own telephones. Surveys may contain keypress or voice recording questions, and the timing and content of each survey may be randomized and customized. A pilot study was conducted in which individuals used the TelEMA system to complete four randomly timed surveys per day for one week; the surveys assessed state affect and social anxiety. Results indicated that participants found TelEMA easy to use and secure, and compliance rates were on par with other EMA methods using mobile devices. Overall, TelEMA is a practical and robust system that enables fast and inexpensive deployment of EMAs.

AB  - This study examines the mobile divide from the perspective of perception of information and knowledge inequity due to smartphone usage, exploring factors that may influence the use of smartphone applications and assessing discrepancies in social and human capital due to usage differences. A survey of smartphone users revealed that gender, age, personal innovativeness, and consumption skills were significant predictors of the frequent use for applications. Simply having more smartphone applications does not contribute to increases social or human capital; it is usage of these apps that makes a difference.

AB  - This study investigated whether any of seven factors of family dysfunction predicted five risk factors for developing eating disorders in young adult women. Participants completed demographic questions, the McMaster Family Assessment Device (Epstein, Baldwin, & Bishop, 1983) and the Setting Conditions for Anorexia Nervosa Scale (Slade & Dewey, 1986) online. Five stepwise multiple regressions evaluated whether FAD scores predicted any of the eating disorder risk factors. Unhealthy affective responsiveness predicted general dissatisfaction and social and personal anxiety, and unhealthy general functioning predicted adolescent problems. No FAD factors predicted perfectionism or weight control. These results confirm the importance of families' affective responsiveness and general functioning to the risk of developing eating disorders. However, the lack of relationship among problem-solving, communication, roles, affective involvement, or behavior control with any of the risk factors for eating disorders warrants further investigation.

AB  - The considerable growth in the number of smart mobile devices with a fast Internet connection provides new challenges for survey researchers. In this article, I compare the data quality between two survey modes: self-administered web surveys conducted via personal computer and those conducted via mobile phones. Data quality is compared based on five indicators: (a) completion rates, (b) response order effects, (c) social desirability, (d) non-substantive responses, and (e) length of open answers. I hypothesized that mobile web surveys would result in lower completion rates, stronger response order effects, and less elaborate answers to open-ended questions. No difference was expected in the level of reporting in sensitive items and in the rate of non-substantive responses. To test the assumptions, an experiment with two survey modes was conducted using a volunteer online access panel in Russia. As expected, mobile web was associated with a lower completion rate, shorter length of open answers, and similar level of socially undesirable and non-substantive responses. However, no stronger primacy effects in mobile web survey mode were found.

AB  - Tablet personal computers (tablet PCs) are popular electronic devices worldwide. They influence many aspects of our social lives. Compared with laptop computers, tablet PCs feature characteristics including enhanced portability and display quality. The purposes of this study were to examine users' attitudes toward tablet personal computers and identify the effects of external factors. This study extended the technology acceptance model and used perceived mobility and viewing experience as the external variables in the proposed model. This study used a web-based survey of 511 participants and found that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use were key determinants of attitude toward tablet personal computers. Also, the perceived ease of use and usefulness of tablet PCs were significantly enhanced by perceived mobility and viewing experience. In addition, all traditional relationships from the origin technology acceptance model were supported. Lastly, both implications of the study and areas of future research are discussed.

KW  - NAVIGATION
KW  - INTERFACE
AB  - Existing web applications force users focus their visual attention on mobile devices while browsing content and services while on the go. To support eyes-free, mobile experiences, designers can minimize interaction with a device by leveraging the auditory channel. Whereas acoustic interfaces have proven to be effective in reducing visual attention, a perplexing challenge is designing aural information architectures for the web. To address this problem, techniques to remodel existing information architectures as linear, aural flows were introduced and evaluated. Mobile web browsing with aural flows is exemplified in ANFORA News, a semiaural mobile site designed to browse large collections of news stories. An exploratory study involving frequent news readers (n=20) investigated the usability and navigation experience with ANFORA News in a mobile setting. Initial evidence suggests that aural flows are a promising paradigm to support eyes-free mobile navigation while on the go, but users still require assistance and additional learning to fully master the aural mechanics of the flows while on the go. Future work will improve on the mechanisms to customize content and control the aural navigation.

AB  - Mode effects on responses to survey items may introduce bias to data collected using multiple modes of administration. The present study examines data from 704 surveys conducted as part of a longitudinal study in which parents and their children had been surveyed at multiple prior time points. Parents of 22-year-old study participants were randomly assigned to one of two mixed-mode conditions: (1) web mode first followed by the offer of an interviewer-administered telephone mode; or (2) telephone mode first followed by the offer of the web mode. Comparison of responses by assigned condition on 12 measures showed one statistically significant difference. Analyses that modeled differences by completed mode and the interaction between assigned condition and completed mode found significant differences on six measures related to completed mode. None of the differences indicated that more socially desirable responses were given in interviewer-administered surveys.

AB  - New opportunities have recently emerged in survey practice, coupled with a need to make changes, and alternative survey data collection modes such as those based on new technologies (for example, the Web and mobile phones) have become a focus of interest. Studies have considered the biases due to data collection modes and to the wording of questions in questionnaires, but they have rarely dealt with the interaction between the two phenomena. This paper presents the results of a study on the interactions between some of the best-known question-wording effects and three data collection modes: face-to-face, Web-based and SMS-based (Short Text Messaging). The results have highlighted some interesting characteristics of the various modes-innovative ones in particular-and have confirmed the existence of potential interactions between data collection modes and question-wording effects. The findings may have significant implications for the study and practice of surveys and entail that, when surveys are designed, account is taken of specific factors associated with the method used to word the questions in questionnaires.

AB  - The emergence of synthetic biology holds the potential of a major breakthrough in the life sciences by transforming biology into a predictive science. The dual-use characteristics of similar breakthroughs during the twentieth century have led to the application of benignly intended research in e.g. virology, bacteriology and aerobiology in offensive biological weapons programmes. Against this background the article raises the question whether the precautionary governance of synthetic biology can aid in preventing this techno-science witnessing the same fate? In order to address this question, this paper proceeds in four steps: it firstly introduces the emerging techno-science of synthetic biology and presents some of its potential beneficial applications. It secondly analyses contributions to the bioethical discourse on synthetic biology as well as precautionary reasoning and its application to life science research in general and synthetic biology more specifically. The paper then identifies manifestations of a moderate precautionary principle in the emerging synthetic biology dual-use governance discourse. Using a dual-use governance matrix as heuristic device to analyse some of the proposed measures, it concludes that the identified measures can best be described as "patchwork precaution" and that a more systematic approach to construct a web of dual-use precaution for synthetic biology is needed in order to guard more effectively against the field's future misuse for harmful applications.

AB  - With the advances in mobile technologies, the ubiquitous tour information service has been emerging as a new solution for providing tour information. This study examined the effects of ubiquitous tour information service on perceived enjoyment and usage intention by tourists. The study begins with a preliminary survey of mobile device users' motives and perceptions of usage, followed by a review of the related literature. The measurements were derived from this process. The demonstrative analysis results classify the quality of ubiquitous tour information service into four categories: system quality, information quality, interface design, and convenience. Before analyzing the data, an exploratory factor analysis for reliability and validity assessment was conducted. Whereas the factors of interface design and convenience did not have a significant impact, the remaining two factors, system quality and information quality, impacted users' perceived enjoyment to a much greater extent. The four categories of ubiquitous tour information service were shown to affect usage intention. Of the four factors, system quality was found to have the highest impact on usage intention, followed by convenience, interface design, and information quality, in that order. The association between perceived enjoyment and usage intention was also supported. Based on the results, academic and managerial implications are discussed.

AB  - In the past, most studies used the technology acceptance model (TAM) to survey the subjective perception of users in using information technology. The usability test was also used to assess the ease of use of user interfaces. This study introduces a conceptual framework to explore the relationship between user's beliefs of TAM and usability testing attributes. Usability testing was conducted on an eCampus learning system with a mobile device. TAM data was collected from the participants for analyzing a possible relationship. The findings of this study reveal that TAM results contradict the usability test results in certain areas. The focus of our proposed research model is supported from the causality between perceived ease of use and usability; however, the correlation between perceived usefulness and usability remains unclear.

AB  - This article discusses the relationship between theories of photography and mobile phone footage. In doing so, it asks if theories of photography still apply in a technologically saturated world of imagery. Technology is an increasingly important part of viewing imagery today and enables imagery to become part of a global cultural flow, thus calling into question the physical connection between viewer and image. This article analyses what happens to that connection when not only the image but also the physical body is mediated and challenged in post-human relations, and examines the ensuing ethical implications. The author takes photojournalism and, in particular, mobile phone footage as a starting point for an exploration of the (post-human) body as evidence and sign of authenticity in the modern age of digital communications and journalism.

AB  - With the growing popularity of smartphones and tablet PCs (tablets) equipped with mobile browsers, the possibilities to administer surveys via mobile devices have expanded. To investigate the possible mode effect on answer behavior, results are compared between a mobile device-assisted web survey and a computer-assisted web survey. First, a premeasurement in the CentERpanel is conducted to analyze the user group of mobile devices. Second, the users are randomly allocated one of the three conditions: (1) conventional computer-assisted web survey, (2) hybrid version: a computer-assisted web survey with a layout similar to mobile web survey, and (3) mobile web survey. Special attention is given to the design of the mobile web questionnaire, taking small screen size, and typical functionalities for touchscreens into account. The findings suggest that survey completion on mobile devices need not lead to different results than on computers, but one should be prepared for a lower response rate and longer survey completion time. Further, the study offers considerations for researchers on survey satisfaction, location during survey completion, and preferred device to access Internet. With adaptations, surveys can be conducted on the newest mobile devices, although new challenges are emerging and further research is called for.

AB  - The proliferation of digital technologyboth as hardware and softwareprovides opportunities for activist groups around the world to connect with one another more rapidly and efficiently than ever before. And as mobile Internet technology (including smartphones, personal digital assistants, and laptops) becomes cheaper and more readily available, the number of services offered to individuals has increased dramatically, including voice communication, Internet browsing, and data transfer. At the same time, the rise in transnational advocacy networks means that non-state actors are garnering new voices and challenging both old and new sites of authority, from local governments and state agencies to regional and international organizations. Based on fieldwork and with a focus on the process of interaction within transnational groups in Southeast Asia, this article adopts a communities of practice (COP) approach and applies it to the impact of digital networking in order to test some of the questions posed about the nature of the so-called technological revolution and to assess the ways in which technological advancement has affected these groups. It hypothesizes that even new and potentially levelling forms of communication can only respond to and reshape the pre-existing social conditions and organizational structures within which network participants function.

AB  - Despite the proliferation of mobile personalization worldwide, the research to date is not definitive regarding the effectiveness of personalization on influencing individuals' intentions to use mobile services. The current research examines how an important feature of mobile services-location personalization-affects individuals' intentions to use these services. Specifically, the current research considers two features of location personalization, namely location accuracy and location precision, and examines how individuals' perceptions of these features affect their integrity trust and integrity distrust in the merchant who provides these services, which in turn affect their intentions to use the services. We developed eight hypotheses. To test them, we conducted a field study with a self-developed mobile system that provided personalized lunch venue recommendations. We recruited 236 participants to take part in the field study. After two weeks, they completed a questionnaire to report their perceptions and intentions to use the service. Our results show that the participants' perceptions of location accuracy and location precision positively affected both integrity trust and integrity distrust ( either directly or through moderation by privacy concerns). Integrity trust increases one's intentions to use personalized mobile services, whereas integrity distrust decreases it. This research provides empirical evidence to illustrate the coexistence of integrity trust and integrity distrust-on the one hand, an individual trusts the integrity of a service provider because the service provider is likely to continue keeping its promise of providing genuine personalized mobile services after making a substantial investment in location detection technologies; on the other hand, the individual distrusts the integrity of a service provider because subsequent to this investment, the service provider has a strong incentive to cheat in order to justify the investment.

AB  - With an integrated framework, this paper aims to analyze user perception and acceptance toward long-term evolution (LTE) services, focusing on factors that may influence the intention to use. We conducted a web-based survey of 1,192 users to test our research model. We employed structural equation modeling (SEM) as the analysis method. The results of the integrated model analysis indicate that system satisfaction is a core determinant of intention to use LTE services. The model also found that other factors, including perceived usefulness and system and service quality, significantly affect intention to use these services. In addition, both perceived adaptivity and processing speed significantly influence perceived usefulness and service quality, respectively. These factors also play key roles in determining users' attitudes. This paper is of value to researchers and engineers designing and improving LTE services for use via mobile phones.

AB  - Mobile donation has gained mainstream media attention since the Haiti Earthquake Relief in 2010. Yet, there is still a lack of research on mobile donation as a new venue of technology-mediated civic engagement. Using nationally representative survey data, this research examines the variations in mobile donation by mobile phone usage patterns and user characteristics such as age, race, and socioeconomic status. Results show that the diversity of mobile phone use and the frequency of relational mobile communication are positively associated with mobile donation. As importantly, mobile donation helps to overcome age, race and SES gaps, giving members of disadvantaged social groups a more accessible tool for civic engagement. Internet donation and mobile donation complement rather than compete with each other.

AB  - Personal digital assistants (PDA), particularly Palm Pilots, are popular data collection devices in experience sampling research. The declining availability of such devices, however, has prompted researchers to explore alternative technologies for signaling participants and collecting responses. The present research considers interactive voice response (IVR) methods, which can deliver questions and collect data using common cell phones. Participants completed an experience sampling study using either a PDA (n = 428) or a cell phone under three different conditions (IVR condition n = 98; IVR Callback condition n = 93; IVR Callback Comeback condition n = 94). We found that response rates were higher when people used PDAs (69%) than when they used their cell phones (IVR condition = 51%), but response rates increased when people could call back within a few minutes of missing a signal (IVR Callback condition = 58%) and had a face-to-face meeting with a researcher midweek (IVR Callback Comeback = 64%). The daily life ratings were similar across the conditions. The findings are encouraging for researchers interested in using IVR cell phone methods for ecological momentary assessment, but more work is needed to develop procedures or incentives that increase response rates.

This study investigates ICT literacy through a simulation designed to capture that construct, to deploy the construct model to measure participant improvement of ICT literacy under experimental conditions, and to estimate the potential for expanded model development. Research questions: How might a multidisciplinary literature review inform a model for ICT literacy? How might a simulation be designed that enables sufficient construct representation for modeling? How might prepost testing simulation be designed to investigate the potential for improved command of ICT literacy? How might a regression model account for variance within the model by the addition of affective elements to a cognitive model? Literature review: Existing conceptualizations of the ICT communication environment demonstrate the need for a new communication model that is sensitive to short text messaging demands in crisis communication settings. As a result of this prefect storm of limits requiring the communicator to rely on critical thinking, awareness of context, and information integration, we designed a cognitive-affective model informed by genre theory to capture the ICT construct: A sociocognitive ability that, at its most effective, facilitates illocutionary action-to confirm and warn, to advise and ask, and to thank and request-for specific audiences of emergency responders. Methodology: A prepost design with practitioner subjects allowed investigation of performance improvement on tasks demanding illocutionary action after training on tasks of high, moderate, and low demand. Through a model based on the independent variables character count, wordcount, and decreased time on task as related to the dependent variable of an overall episode score, we were able to examine the internal construct strength with and without the addition of affective independent variables. Results and discussion: Of the three prepost models used to study the impact of training, participants demonstrated statistically significant improvement on episodes of high demand on all cognitive model variables. The addition of affective variables, such as attitudes toward text messaging, allowed increased model strength on tasks of high and moderate complexity. These findings suggest that an empirical basis for the construct of ICT literacy is possible and that, under simulation conditions, practitioner improvement may be demonstrated. Practically, it appears that it is possible to train emergency responders to improve their command of ICT literacy so that those most in need of humanitarian response during a crisis may receive it. Future research focusing on communication in digital environments will undoubtedly extend these finding in terms of construct validation and deployment in crisis settings.

AB  - Recording points of interest using GPS whilst working in the field is an established technique in geographical fieldwork, where the user's current position is used as the spatial reference to be captured; this is known as geo-tagging. We outline the development and evaluation of a smartphone application called Zapp that enables geo-tagging of any distant point on the visible landscape. The ability of users to log or retrieve information relating to what they can see, rather than where they are standing, allows them to record observations of points in the broader landscape scene, or to access descriptions of landscape features from any viewpoint. The application uses the compass orientation and tilt of the phone to provide data for a line of sight algorithm that intersects with a Digital Surface Model stored on the mobile device. We describe the development process and design decisions for Zapp present the results of a controlled study of the accuracy of the application, and report on the use of Zapp for a student field exercise. The studies indicate the feasibility of the approach, but also how the appropriate use of such techniques will be constrained by current levels of precision in mobile sensor technology. The broader implications for interactive query of the distant landscape and for remote data logging are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Paper has been the format of choice for disseminating geographic information for millennia; however the arrival of the internet and mobile technologies has created new modes of map consumption. This paper investigates the future role of paper mapping in a society where access to online digital mapping is freely available. The research consists of an online survey to investigate how people use and view online/digital and paper maps, together with a task-based user study to investigate the suitability of each map format for a variety of given tasks. Similar to previous research, we categorize participants into two groups (experts and non-experts/ novices) based on their level of geographic skill. Results demonstrate that geographic knowledge and the context of use clearly relate to preference of map format. As geographic skill increases, there is a greater preference for paper maps; non-experts prefer online/digital maps. Also, paper is the preferred medium for planning and executing navigation on foot across all groups. Overall, results suggest that paper maps are here to stay for the foreseeable future and remain the preferred choice for some in the digital age.

AB  - Success in web services cannot promise the success in corresponding mobile services. To understand the mobile service adoption behavior under the context of web-mobile service transition, this study, taking mobile eWOM services as an example, investigates the role of trust in mobile service adoption and empirically examines the trust transfer mechanism. Specifically, trust in web services and two relationship-relevant factors namely functional consistency and perceived entitativity are proposed as the predictors of trust in mobile services. A field survey with 235 mobile eWOM services users is conducted to test the research model and hypotheses. The key findings include (1) trust in mobile services positively influences intention to use mobile services; (2) trust in web services, functional consistency and perceived entitativity positively influence trust in mobile services; (3) functional consistency positively influences perceived entitativity. Limitations, theoretical and practical implications are also discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article reports on the results of an empirical analysis of the effectiveness of a set of collaborative spatial decision support tools developed to support a land use allocation problem in a peat-meadow polder in the Netherlands. The tools feature spatial multicriteria analysis as the means to make spatially explicit trade-offs between stakeholder objectives in three different ways: as colors on multiple printed maps, qualitatively on a single digital map and quantitatively on a single digital map. An interactive mapping device is used as the interface between spatial information and participants. A series of controlled experiments was conducted with 30 participants, who were asked to use the tools and perform specific individual and group allocation tasks. Data on the responses of the participants were collected through questionnaires, observer notes, video film and multicriteria scores. The analysis focused on three aspects of effectiveness: usefulness of the tools; clarity of tool information; and impact on decisions. The findings of this analysis are discussed within the context of the information offered by the tools, individual and collaborative work of participants and the spatial and numerical quality of the resulting land use plans. From the experiments, it is clear that the cognitive effort related to the volume and format of information is a critical issue in spatial decision support. This holds true for both the level of detail per item of information and the amount of information to be supplied to the participants. Although the quantitative tool provided the most information, the participants did not consider this tool the most useful and it did not produce the best results. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study investigates the effects of cultural orientation and the degree of disdain for robots on the preferred conversational styles in human-to-robot interactions. 203 participants self-reported on questionnaires through a computer-based online survey. The two requesting situations were intended to simulate the participants' interactions with humanoid social robots through an Internet video-phone medium of communication. Structural equation modeling was performed to examine the mediating role of mechanistic disdain between multicultural orientation and conversational constraints. The findings reveal that between the two dimensions of multicultural orientation, only open-mindedness inversely influences mechanistic disdain. Mechanistic disdain, in turn, negatively affects three face-related conversational constraints, thereby leading to a lesser concern for robots' feelings, for minimizing impositions on robots, and for avoiding robots' negative evaluations. The implications of our findings on humans' relations with virtual robot entities and on the future development of humanoid robots are discussed.

AB  - This study analyses the effects of perceived relevance and perceived vulnerability on approach and avoidance intentions toward Location-Based Mobile Marketing (LBMM) and investigates the moderating effect of Privacy Self-Efficacy (PSE). For this, the study considers two types of consumers' approach intentions and two types of their avoidance intentions to provide a better understanding of LBMM adoption. The results of an online survey of 1864 mobile phone users in the USA indicate that perceived relevance had positive effects of both types of consumers' approach intentions but negative effects only on their willingness to refuse. In addition, perceived vulnerability had positive effects on both types of consumers' avoidance intentions as well as their willingness to pretest. PSE had significant moderating effects on the relationships between perceived relevance/perceived vulnerability and approach/avoidance intentions. These results have important theoretical and practical implications.

AB  - Purpose - The video-sharing website YouTube encourages interaction between its users via the provision of a user comments facility. This was originally envisaged as a way for viewers to provide information about and reactions to videos, but is employed for other communicative purposes including sharing ideas, paying tributes, social networking, and question answering. This study seeks to examine and categorise the types of comments created by YouTube users to highlight the various ways in which this interactive feature has been employed as a means of communication and self-expression.
   Design/methodology/approach - By conducting a content analysis of 66,637 user comments on YouTube videos the authors created a classification schema which may be used to categorise the types of comments users leave.
   Findings - The schema reveals ten broad categories, and 58 subcategories which reflect the wide-ranging use of the YouTube comments facility.
   Research limitations/implications - As YouTube continues to evolve, new types of comments that do not appear in the scheme outlined will appear. However, this schema will provide an initial structure upon which other investigations can build when analysing the ongoing use of the YouTube comments feature as a communication device.
   Practical implications - This scheme may be used for researchers in a variety of disciplines who are interested in using user-generated content. The scheme will aid in the description and mining of this content and provides a way of structuring this content into categories representing user intent.
   Social implications - This study highlights the variety of purposes to which the user commenting facility of YouTube is employed. These include purposes such as reminiscence, grieving, giving advice and communication.
   Originality/value - This is the first detailed, content-based analysis. of the types of comments created by YouTube users. The classification scheme facilitates the analysis of these comments for a variety of purposes, including marketing, communication studies and studies of information seeking.

AB  - A large number of findings in survey research suggest that responses to sensitive questions are situational and can vary in relation to context. The methodological literature demonstrates that social desirability biases are less prevalent in self-administered surveys, particularly in Web surveys, when there is no interviewer and less risk of presenting oneself in an unfavorable light. Since there is a growing number of users of mobile Web browsers, we focused our study on the effects of different devices (PC or cell phone) in Web surveys on the respondents' willingness to report sensitive information. To reduce selection bias, we carried out a two-wave cross-over experiment using a volunteer online access-panel in Russia. Participants were asked to complete the questionnaire in both survey modes: PC and mobile Web survey. We hypothesized that features of mobile Web usage may affect response accuracy and lead to more socially desirable responses compared to the PC Web survey mode. We found significant differences in the reporting of alcohol consumption by mode, consistent with our hypothesis. But other sensitive questions did not show similar effects. We also found that the presence of familiar bystanders had an impact on the responses, while the presence of strangers did not have any significant effect in either survey mode. Contrary to expectations, we did not find evidence of a positive impact of completing the questionnaire at home and trust in data confidentiality on the level of reporting. These results could help survey practitioners to design and improve data quality in Web surveys completed on different devices.

AB  - Mobile radio frequency identification (RFID) services are expected to be launched in full-scale as a new service option in the telecommunications service market following the development of RFID technology and maturation of the IT infrastructure. Importance of customer loyalty has been widely recognized in business marketing for a long time, and the customer loyalty enhancement strategies for mobile RFID services is of significance to telecommunication carriers in terms of new business value creation. This study identifies the factors affecting customer loyalty for mobile RFID services and presents telecommunication service managers with information useful for improving customer loyalty for related new services. The data was collected from customers with some experience in the use of mobile RFID services through an online survey for an empirical analysis. And the collected data was analysed with structural equation model to verify the cause and effect relationship among perceived quality, switching cost, perceived value, customer satisfaction, switching barrier and customer relationship. The analysis showed that the quality of tag recognition and content quality proved to have a direct impact on the customer satisfaction, whereas connection quality and ease of use would rather indirectly than directly influence customer satisfaction by perceived value. Perceived value and satisfaction affected the loyalty. Adaptation cost affects switching barriers, the higher the switching barriers, the stronger the loyalty. Based on the results of the empirical analysis, practical implications were given. What is more, mobile RFID customers were divided into two groups that are favourably and unfavourably disposed toward the service, and suggested customer loyalty improvement strategies adapted for each group.

AB  - This paper investigates information and communication technologies for development (ICT4D) projects from around the world. It finds that computer and Internet promotion schemes usually fail despite active support, but mobile penetration in even the poorest countries is deepening organically. It argues that mobiles have emotional appeal because talking is a universal psycho-sociological propensity while the other two are principally utilitarian technologies that have to generate returns on investment. The search for killer apps is likely to be fruitless because technological adoption is conditional upon need and absorptive capacity. The paper raises questions about the continuing support for ICT4D among proponents. Journal of Information Technology (2012) 27, 326-338. doi:10.1057/jit.2012.19; published online 9 October 2012

AB  - Survey research has long grappled with the concept of survey mode preference: the idea that a respondent may prefer to participate in one survey mode over another. This article experimentally examines the effect of mode preference on response, contact, and cooperation rates; mode choice; and data collection efficiency. Respondents to a 2008 telephone survey (n = 1,811; AAPOR RR3 = 38 percent) were asked their mode preference for future survey participation. These respondents were subsequently followed up in 2009 with two independent survey requests. The first follow-up survey request was another telephone survey (n = 548; AAPOR RR2 = 55.5 percent). In the second follow-up survey (n = 565; AAPOR RR2 = 46.0 percent), respondents were randomly assigned to one of four mode treatments: Web only, mail only, Web followed by mail, and mail followed by Web. We find that mode preference predicts participation in Web and phone modes, cooperation in phone mode (where contact and cooperation can be disentangled), and the selection of a mode when given the option of two modes. We find weak and mixed evidence about the relationship between mode preference and reduction of field effort. We discuss the important implications these findings have for mixed mode surveys.

AB  - This study examines the question of whether the geographical digital divide in China has reduced with the introduction of mobile, including 3G, telecommunications. Geographical digital divide is measured primarily by teledensity at the provincial level. Changes of the geographical digital divide over time are analyzed within the framework of hardware, software, and other factors. Following this analytical framework, mobile or wireless telecommunications has higher potential of equipping the poor and narrowing the digital divide, especially in developing countries. In terms of hardware, the installation cost of wireless technology is often lower than fixed-line telephone services, especially in remote rural areas and/or areas of difficult terrains. The hardware required by users, notably mobile handsets, is also cheaper to own than personal computers (PCs). In terms of software, a greater variety and more flexible packages are often offered for mobile telecommunication services, and most applications on mobile phones are simpler and more user-friendly. Moreover, the requirements of mobile technologies on some other key factors known to affect information and communication technology (ICT) adoption rates are also lower. In particular, the requirements for language, especially English, proficiency and computer literacy are lower. Furthermore, proactive government measures have been implemented in China to narrow the digital divide through supportive policies influencing the factors named above. Under these circumstances, the well-known association between economic growth and widening digital divide (a difficult dilemma faced by governments of most developing countries) has been reversed in China after 2005.

AB  - The proliferation and ease of access to information and communication technologies (ICTs) such as Facebook, text messaging, and instant messaging has resulted in ICT users being presented with more real-time streaming data than ever before. Unfortunately, this has also resulted in individuals increasingly engaging in multitasking as an information management strategy. The purpose of this study was to examine how college students multitask with ID's and to determine the impacts of this multitasking on their college grade point average (GPA). Using web survey data from a Large sample of college students at one university (N = 1839), we found that students reported spending a large amount of time using ICTs on a daily basis. Students reported frequently searching for content not related to courses, using Facebook, emailing, talking on their cell phones, and texting while doing schoolwork. Hierarchical (blocked) linear regression analyses revealed that using Facebook and texting while doing schoolwork were negatively associated with overall college GPA. Engaging in Facebook use or texting while trying to complete schoolwork may tax students' capacity for cognitive processing and preclude deeper learning. Our research indicates that the type and purpose of ICT use matters in terms of the educational impacts of multitasking. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

KW  - TRENDS SURVEY
AB  - The importance of the impact of IT for organizations around the world, especially in light of a very slow recovery from the global financial crisis, has amplified the need to provide a better understanding of the specific geographic similarities and differences of IT managerial and technical trends. Going beyond identifying these influential factors is also the need to understand the considerations for addressing them in light of recognizing the respective local characteristics, especially when operating in a globally linked environment, although somehow heavily influenced locally. By comparing and contrasting IT trends from different geographies, this paper presents important local and international factors (e.g., management concerns, influential technologies, budgets/spending, organizational considerations) necessary to prepare IT leaders for the challenges that await them. It can also serve as an indicator as the respective geographies evolve from the economic conundrum. The research is based on data from four geographic regions (United States (US), Europe, Asia, and Latin America). The same questionnaire (although translated for the respective respondents), based on the lead authors well-respected and long-running Society for Information Management survey, was applied across the geographies. This paper presents the major findings based on survey responses from 620 respondents (275 US, 100 European, 59 Asian, and 186 Latin) in mid-2011. The top five management concerns were: (1) IT and business alignment; (2) business agility and speed to market; (3) business process management and business process reengineering; (4) business productivity and cost reduction; (5) IT reliability and efficiency. The five most influential technologies were: (1) business intelligence; (2) enterprise resource planning systems; (3) cloud computing; (4) mobile and wireless applications; (5) customer relationship management.

AB  - This study examines the impact of information communication technology (ICT) on electricity consumption in emerging economies. The empirical results, obtained from dynamic panel demand models, show a positive and statistically significant relationship between ICT and electricity consumption when ICT is measured using internet connections, mobile phones or the number of PCs. Long-run ICT elasticities are smaller than income elasticities but because ICT growth rates are so much higher than income growth rates, the impact of ICT on electricity demand is greater than the impact of income on electricity demand. One implication of these results is that policies designed to close the "digital divide" between developed and developing economics by increasing the adoption of ICT in developing countries are put at odds with energy policies to reduce GHG emissions.

KW  - Question and Test Interoperability
AB  - Using technology to create new types of questions is important, but also exploring new types of test representations or analyzing the most adequate technological device to support a specific assessment activity based on tests. This paper presents a conceptual model that defines and relates three dimensions to be considered for advancing on Computing-Based Testing (CBT): the Question-item, the Test and the Activity. The framework assists in the categorization and design of advanced CBT scenarios and opens a new domain for questions and tests supported by ICT. Besides, the paper proposes two models for the technological design and implementation of the Test and Question-item dimensions. The models represent an extension of the IMS Question and Test Interoperability standard. They are platform-independent models (PIMs) that formulate the elements that can be mapped to platform-specific models (PSMs) for implementing advanced CBT solutions. To show the relevance, value and usability of the contributions, the paper also describes the application of the framework and PIMs to design and implement three exemplary CBT scenarios with their corresponding CBT-PSMs. Within the global scope of the CBT conceptual model, the first scenario shows how question-items can be enriched with specific multimedia information (web maps). The second scenario illustrates another particular case of the CBT domain where a test can be augmented with real physical elements. And finally, the third scenario describes an implementation that combines advanced question-items and tests using virtual worlds. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Multiple computing devices continue to develop capabilities that support online gambling, resulting in the need to evaluate the extent that this trend will contribute to gambling problems. A sample of 1,141 participants completed an online survey assessing interest in and difficulties limiting use of digital services. Questionnaire items measured a range of behaviours associated with electronic service use (e. g., surfing, complaints). Results indicated that individuals utilising digital services and experiencing problems limiting their TV and Mobile phone usage were more likely to report gambling problems. These respondents were more likely to click on gambling-related links, report receiving larger amounts of spam, make more attempts to unsubscribe, and to click on links to counselling sites. Exposure and interest in electronic modes of communication can be associated with a greater risk of gambling related problems.

AB  - A recent hypothesis in empirical brain research on language is that the fundamental difference between animal and human communication systems is captured by the distinction between finite-state and more complex phrase-structure grammars, such as context-free and context-sensitive grammars. However, the relevance of this distinction for the study of language as a neurobiological system has been questioned and it has been suggested that a more relevant and partly analogous distinction is that between non-adjacent and adjacent dependencies. Online memory resources are central to the processing of non-adjacent dependencies as information has to be maintained across intervening material. One proposal is that an external memory device in the form of a limited push-down stack is used to process non-adjacent dependencies. We tested this hypothesis in an artificial grammar learning paradigm where subjects acquired non-adjacent dependencies implicitly. Generally, we found no qualitative differences between the acquisition of non-adjacent dependencies and adjacent dependencies. This suggests that although the acquisition of non-adjacent dependencies requires more exposure to the acquisition material, it utilizes the same mechanisms used for acquiring adjacent dependencies. We challenge the push-down stack model further by testing its processing predictions for nested and crossed multiple non-adjacent dependencies. The push-down stack model is partly supported by the results, and we suggest that stack-like properties are some among many natural properties characterizing the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms that implement the online memory resources used in language and structured sequence processing.

AB  - Research problem: When dealing with procedural documents, individuals sometimes encounter comprehension problems due to poor information design. Researchers studying the use and understanding of procedural documents, as well as technical writers charged with the design of these documents, or usability specialists evaluating their quality, would all benefit from tools allowing them to collect real-time data concerning user behavior in user-centered studies. With this in mind, the generic software Technical Instructions Processing-Evaluations and eXperiments Editor (TIP-EXE) was designed to facilitate the carrying out of such studies. Research questions: Does document design, and specifically the matching or mismatching of the terms employed in a user manual and on the corresponding device, affect the cognitive processes involved in the comprehension of procedural instructions? Can we use a software tool like TIP-EXE to assess the impact of document design on the use and understanding of a procedural document? Literature review: A review of the methods employed to study either the use of procedural documents or their cognitive processing, and to evaluate the quality of these documents, revealed the lack of tools for collecting relevant data. Methodology: TIP-EXE software was used to set up and run a laboratory experiment designed to collect data concerning the effect of document design on the performance of a task. The experiment was conducted with 36 participants carrying out tasks involving the programming of a digital timer under one of three conditions: "matching instructions," "mismatching instructions," "mismatching instructions + picture". Based on a click-and-read method for blurred text, TIP-EXE was used to collect data on the time the users spent reading the instructions, as well as the time spent handling the timer. Results and discussion: Results show that "matching instructions" (when the terms employed in the user manual match the terms on the device) enhance user performance. This instructional format results in less time spent consulting the instructions and handling the device, as well as fewer errors. This research shows that TIP-EXE software can be used to study the way in which operating instructions are read, and the time spent consulting specific information contained therein, thereby revealing the effects of document design on user behavior.

AB  - Drawing upon utility maximization theory, this study examines the consequences of quick response (QR) code mobile promotion in terms of information privacy concerns, defensive responses (intention to protect, fabricate, or withhold), and loyalty. Two contextual variables, social anxiety and situational involvement, are hypothesized as moderators. The main survey employs the scenario method with 667 general consumers in Japan. The results indicate that most of the main effects are supported for both moderators. There are strong interaction effects of social anxiety and situational involvement in intention to protect and intention to fabricate personal information. Our study suggests that QR code promotion is a practical and useful tool for loyalty, and its use may significantly depend on its context, whether physical or psychological.

AB  - Mobile applications are software packages that can be installed and executed in a mobile device. Which mobile application is trustworthy for a user to purchase, download, install, execute or recommend becomes a crucial issue that impacts its final success. This paper proposes TruBeRepec, a trust-behavior-based reputation and recommender system for mobile applications. We explore a model of trust behavior for mobile applications based on the result of a large-scale user survey. We further develop a number of algorithms that are used to evaluate individual user's trust in a mobile application through trust behavior observation, generate the application's reputation by aggregating individual trust and provide application recommendations based on the correlation of trust behaviors. We show the practical significance of TruBeRepec through simulations and analysis with regard to effectiveness, robustness, and usability, as well as privacy.

AB  - Recent work suggests that text messaging impairs simulated and actual driving performance and that this impairment exceeds that of conversing on a cell phone while driving. Additionally, research has shown that text messaging is common in several countries, and despite drivers acknowledging the high risk involved in doing so, drivers continue to engage in this behaviour - regardless of legislation banning it. A nationwide online survey in New Zealand, of 1057 respondents, collected anonymous self-report data regarding the frequency of cell phone use (conversing and text messaging) while driving, beliefs concerning the safety of conversing or text messaging while driving. This article presents part of the results of that study - focusing on text messaging behaviour and risk perception regarding text messaging while driving. Over half of respondents surveyed reported sending or reading between 1 and 5 text messages while driving in a typical week. Despite this, 89% of participants agreed that text messaging while driving in general impairs driving performance. There were no gender differences between the number of text messages read and sent. Age was found to be an important indicator of participant's willingness to engage in text messaging while driving, with younger drivers more likely to engage in this behaviour. The implications of these findings for future research and countermeasure development are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - kirkbride g., floyd v., tate c. & wendler m.c. (2012) Journal of Nursing Management 20, 344353 ?Weathering the storm: nurses satisfaction with a mobile admission nurse service Aim To evaluate nurses satisfaction with, and perceptions of, a practice innovation introducing a Mobile Admission Nurse service. Background Staff nurses identified that the admission process, while crucial to initiating safe and appropriate acute care, can be disruptive and interfere with care in progress. A pilot project implementing the role of a Mobile Admission Nurse was introduced to address this need. Method A self-developed web-based survey was administered to a convenience sample of 104 RNs who had used the services during the pilot project. Results Staff nurses (n = 78) reported a chaotic, demanding work environment within which the admission process disrupts the flow of care. The Mobile Admission Nurse helped them in weathering the storm, which was the overarching theme that emerged during data analysis. Conclusions Having an admission nurse complete the admission process steadied workflow processes for nurses. Improved patient safety and increased staff and family satisfaction were also reported. The strongly positive feedback led to expansion of the service. Implications for nursing management Proactively redesigning work processes, using a structured theoretical model such as the (PlanDoStudyAct) PDSA approach, may improve outcomes in a chaotic practice environment.

AB  - This paper examines the early stages of VoIP usage by analyzing the relationship between the usage of VoIP services and other voice and non-voice communication services in Italy. In doing so, it aims at filling the gap in the empirical literature on the diffusion of VoIP among consumers and aims at investigating the relationship between VoIP adoption and the usage of telecom and Internet-related services. It relies upon a survey carried out among consumers in Italy in 2006. The use of VoIP is negatively associated with the usage of other voice communication services mobile communications in particular, but shows some degree of complementarity with other non-voice (Internet-based) communication services, suggesting that familiarity with the web plays a significant and positive role in explaining the adoption of VoIP applications. Furthermore, individual users' technical skills, job position and communications' habits also matter in determining the adoption of VoIP. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Yehliu Geopark mGuiding is an Android application that can perform several tasks related to guiding tourists. The improvement of the application is based on a user evaluation of the former version of the Yehliu Geopark tour guiding system which was designed to be executed on a personal digital assistant device. The user evaluation data were acquired from a questionnaire survey comprising a sample of 101 respondents and were processed using ridits analysis and importance-performance analysis. Results revealed the tourists' preferences for the tour guiding system. The application was redesigned based on the tourists' preferences. The new features of the application include: (1) a Geopark map that is attractive and easy to read; (2) augmented reality (AR) with camera and global positioning system (GPS) functions; (3) user-friendly guiding interface of scenic spots. The application integrates tracking and location functions using GPS coordinates, multi-media guiding (descriptions of scenic spots, videos, photographs and audio presentations), suggested tour selection and searching using AR. The Yehliu Geopark mGuiding system offers a user-friendly interface that the tourists can use on their own smartphone for a complete tour.

AB  - Purpose - The management of unprofitable customer relationships and particularly their abandonment is a topic that has received increasing interest among practitioners and researchers over recent years. Within this manuscript the authors aim to analyze the impact of unprofitable customer abandonment on the abandoning firm's current customers, specifically their exit, voice, and loyalty intentions toward the abandoning firm.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on an online experiment conducted among 385 US customers. Respondents were allocated randomly to one of ten conditions (five levels of tie strength x two types of abandonment strategy) and exposed to a scenario describing a customer abandonment decision implemented by a mobile phone provider. The resulting data were analyzed using a combination of analysis of variance (ANOVA) and structural equation modeling.
   Findings - The study shows that current customers are significantly more likely to respond actively to unprofitable customer abandonment (exit/voice) than passively through silence and loyalty. Additionally, it shows that increasing satisfaction or switching cost among current customers are unlikely to limit the potential negative consequences of unprofitable customer abandonment. The only variable that drives the choice between exit, voice, and loyalty is the perceived attractiveness of the best alternative relationship.
   Originality/value - This work analyzes for the first time how existing customers that the firm would like to retain react toward the news that the company proactively terminates unprofitable customer relationships. Therefore, insight is provided into the likely cost associated with unprofitable customer abandonment - a question that has not been the subject of any empirical study as of today.

AB  - Technology acceptance theories predict user intentions to use services tailored for organisational needs. However, in this paper, we postulate that the aforementioned theories do not apply when investigating intentions towards the use of mobile data services (MDS), as the latter encompasses supplementary characteristics, such as fun and enjoyment, which are not taken into account under available models of user acceptance. The incorporation of the affective dimension is proposed by reintroducing the Triandis theory of human behaviour to the MDS domain. A web-based survey (N = 219) was conducted to investigate our research hypotheses and validate our model of MDS usage intention. Results showed that the MDS usage intention can be predicted by cognitive and affective factors under the lens of social influences. Additionally, the main antecedents of MDS actual use are perceived usefulness, perceived value and intention to use MDS.

T2  - PHARMACOECONOMICS
LA  - English
KW  - CHOICE
KW  - WILLINGNESS
KW  - PREFERENCES
AB  - Background: In the past decade, the range of contraceptives available has increased dramatically. There are limited data on the factors that determine women's choices on contraceptive alternatives or what factors providers consider most important when recommending contraceptive products to women.
   Objectives: Our objectives were to compare women's (consumers') preferences and GPs' (providers') views in relation to existing and new contraceptive methods, and particularly to examine what factors increase the acceptability of different contraceptive products.
   Methods: A best-worst attribute stated-choice experiment was completed online. Participants (Australian women of reproductive age and Australian GPs) completed questions on 16 contraceptive profiles. 200 women of reproductive age were recruited through a commercial panel. GPs from all states of Australia were randomly sampled and approached by phone; 162 GPs agreed to participate. Participants chose the best and worst attribute levels of hypothetical but realistic prescribed contraceptive products. Best and worst choices were modelled using multinomial logit and product features were ranked from best to worst according to the size of model coefficients.
   Results: The most attractive feature of the contraceptive products for both GPs and women consumers were an administration frequency of longer than 1 year and light or no bleeding. Women indicated that the hormonal vaginal ring was the least attractive mode of administration.
   Conclusions: Women and GPs agree that longer-acting methods with less bleeding are important features in preferred methods of contraception; however, women are also attracted to products involving less invasive modes of administration. While the vaginal ring may fill the niche in Australia for a relatively non-invasive, moderately long-acting and effective contraceptive, the results of this study indicate that GPs will need to promote the benefits of the vaginal ring to overcome negative perceptions about this method among women who may benefit from using it.

AB  - An online survey of 624 respondents was divided evenly between men and women, with exactly 104 subjects in each of the six generational groupings. The respondents' occupational and other demographic characteristics do not deviate significantly from Japanese averages comprising a good cross-representational Japanese sample. A pre-Olympic survey was conducted on August 67, followed by a second survey carried out after the Olympics on September 12, 2008. Audience images of China and the Chinese improved as a result of exposure to media content during the Olympics period, although the improvements varied in degree somewhat depending on the issue at hand. As for reported audience attitudes towards China and the Chinese, the pre- to post-Olympic shifts were far less significant than observations of stable (i.e. apparently not significantly influenced by Olympics media coverage) attitudes/impressions in line with the audience members' individual ideological orientation. Among the ideological-type groups, those in the National Regime-oriented group had more salient and robust attitudes, in general, towards many items surveyed in the research. In terms of the reported preferred media use, the audience was categorised into three groups: newspaper readers/radio listeners, television watchers/Internet users and cellular phone users. Each group displayed similar tendencies regarding the relationship of individual ideological orientation and these individuals' respective evaluations of China/Chinese.

AB  - Ratings of severity and frequency of engagement with distracting driver behaviours are reported in this paper. Survey data were collected using an anonymous online questionnaire. Four hundred eighty-two respondents contributed to the survey during a 2 month data collection period. Results indicate that the three behaviours rated as most distracting when driving were (i) writing text messages (41%), (ii) reading text messages (62%), and (iii) using a cellular telephone hand-held (52%). The three most frequently reported distracting behaviours that resulted in accidents were (i) 'interaction with child passengers' 2.1% (near misses = 7.5%), (ii) both, route guidance destination entry with 2% (near misses = 2.8%) and use of an '... add-on media device, e.g., an iPod' with 2% (near misses = 3.9%), and (iii) the three items 'reading a text message, 'following advice from a route guidance system', and 'interaction with pets', all with 1.7% of respondents reporting an accident when undertaking the activity (with 6.5%, 3%, and 2.2% respectively for near misses). Two hierarchical regression models were explored. The first introducing personal factors, i.e., age, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability and intellect (R-2 = 0.131, p < 0.001). The second controlled for variables in the first model and introduced driver-related variables, mileage, penalty points, and frequency of accidents with assumed responsibility (R-2 = 0.253, p < 0.001). This model identified age, extraversion, mileage, penalty points and accidents all to be significant predictors of engagement with unnecessary distractions. The data presents a picture of widespread awareness of, and engagement with, distracting behaviours by drivers in the United Kingdom. Findings from the hierarchical regressions suggest scope may exist to mediate the levels of distracting behaviours by exploring individual differences and driving styles. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - How should we measure broadband adoption by individuals and communities, given different modes of access, including home broadband, smartphone use, and public access? We measure online activities and indicators of skill to understand opportunities for digital citizenship, or participation in society online. Based on a 2011 survey in Chicago, we find more mobile phone adoption among Blacks than among non-Hispanic Whites, and greater likelihood of Internet use for job searches among residents who rely primarily on smartphones to go online than among home broadband adopters. Yet our analysis also shows that broadband at home remains critically important for digital citizenship, and that the growth in mobile phone use has not erased inequalities in participation online and seems unlikely to do so. Moreover, smartphones are not bridging the gap in disadvantaged communities. Multilevel statistical models show inequality in both Internet access and economic and political activities across geographic areas, or communities. Technology disparities that are patterned by place have implications for opportunity and equity at the neighborhood level.

AB  - "Kontroversen urn die Digitalen Geisteswissenschaften: Ein Arbeitsplan". Observations on the current stage of the Digital Humanities and their environment identify four dangers: (1) The focus on infrastructures for the Digital Humanities may obscure that research ultimately is driven by analytical methods and tools, not just by the provision of data or publishing tools. (2) Information technology can support the Humanities in many forms and national traditions. That textual analysis is much discussed right now, should not hide the view of a broader disciplinary field. (3) The mobile revolution looming may once again lead to a repetition of highly destructive processes observed at the PC and the interne revolutions. (4) The Digital Humanities may have to take a much stronger part in the development, not only the reception, of technology. A series of concrete and controversial questions, which allow the discussion of some of these trends, is derived.

AB  - Nowadays the web map (E-map) is an indispensable wayfinding tool in the Internet-based society. However, its usability will vary with a different navigational technique or input device. The navigational techniques currently adopted by various web maps were investigated and analyzed. Moreover, two input devices, i.e., the mouse and the touch screen, were operated in four navigational techniques to study the differences in their functions and performances. Later, the research findings were utilized to develop a new navigational technique. The research was divided into two stages. During the first stage, all the navigational techniques in current use were investigated and compared. Then, based on the results of analysis, the enhanced navigator with continuous control (ENCC) was designed. During the second stage, the searching and browsing techniques of different web maps were simulated. Afterwards, the mouse and the touch screen were employed separately to conduct simulation tests in the following navigational techniques: (1) combined panning buttons (CPB), (2) distributed panning buttons (DPB), (3) ENCC, and (4) C&D. A total of 36 participants took part in the trials. At the end of the experiment, the operational performances of the participants were studied through the two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA); besides, the subjective evaluation questionnaires were answered. It was discovered that the mouse did better than the touch screen in the four navigational techniques. Besides, among the four techniques, ENCC showed the best performance. Capable of continuous control and continuous display, the ENCC interface was upgraded in terms of operational speed and directional control. The findings can be used as a reference in the design of web maps. Also, it is suggested that ENCC should be widely applied to touch screens and mice so that the navigation of information space may be facilitated. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although research interest in post adoption behavior of ICT (Information and Communication Technology) users increases from year to year, few studies examine how motivational factors and service type influence post adoption behavior. This study investigates the antecedents of post adoption behavior in the Mobile Data Services (MDS) domain. The study conducted a nationwide online survey in Korea to verify the proposed research model that includes motivational factors and service type. Two extrinsic motivation factors (post usefulness and post monetary value) and two intrinsic motivation factors (post ease of use and post enjoyment) are the main components of the motivational factors. The results of the study reveal that the motivational factors and service type influence the post adopter type in the MDS context. The findings of this study help provide guidelines for MDS providers to select a target market and to devise a strategy that meets the stated objectives of the selected market. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Minimizing unit nonresponse and maximizing reporting accuracy about sensitive items are common goals among survey practitioners. In order to maximize reporting accuracy without compromising on response rates a common strategy is to recruit respondents over the phone and switch them to a self-administered mode (e.g., IVR, web) for answering the sensitive items. A drawback to the "recruit-and-switch" design is that a substantial portion of the sample (typically 20 percent or more) drop out during the mode switch. Recent evidence suggests that this form of nonresponse can introduce bias and offset gains in accuracy achieved by self-administration. We analyze respondents' likelihood of complying with the mode switch request in a survey of university alumni. Results indicate that paradata derived from the screening interview are related to mode switch participation. Also, we find evidence that adding reluctant sample members into the mode switch respondent pool yields improved estimates with lower nonresponse bias.

TI  - Sharing mobile phones in developing countries: Implications for the digital divide
T2  - TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE

KW  - Information technology
KW  - Appropriate technology
AB  - Current estimates of the digital divide in mobile phones between rich and poor countries are based on the ethnocentric assumption that in both regions the use of these products takes place through individual ownership. But while this assumption may be largely true in the former countries, it does not match the circumstances in the latter regions where a considerable amount of sharing is shown to take place (partly for cultural reasons). Using the available survey evidence and a simple arithmetic framework, I show that when sharing is taken into account, the divide entirely ceases to exist or is greatly reduced (though there are one or two exceptions to this general pattern). Improvements in data collection practice will tend, as I see it, to strengthen rather than cast doubt upon this novel finding. If so, questions arise as to the need for a gap analysis per se.
   As defined by most international organizations, the digital divide in mobile phones is the ratio of subscribers in developed countries to subscribers in developing countries (I use the terms owners and subscribers synonymously(1)). This definition however assumes that the only way in which benefits accrue to individuals is by individual ownership of mobile phones.(2) And while this may make sense in developed countries where ownership is indeed widespread, it does not make much sense in poor countries where benefits from use are more heavily derived by sharing of the technology. The problem here is created by the illegitimate transposition of an assumption from one set of circumstances to a highly different environment, a phenomenon described, among others, by Myrdal [5]. My purpose below is to examine the implications of this assumption for the digital divide in mobile phones between rich and poor countries. In particular, I will argue that current measures of this divide are quite heavily overstated, in some cases to the point where the divide disappears altogether. For this purpose I will rely mainly on household survey data that pertains to the middle of the past decade. The first part of the paper deals with the context of the digital divide and a description of the major socio-economic effects of mobile phones. The second part is concerned with the concepts and measures of sharing while the final part is concerned with empirical evidence. Both parts 2 and 3 are based on a distinction between two major types of sharing behavior. And both parts use a measure of mobile phones per 100 inhabitants. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - One of the major obstacles to effective pricing emanates from difficulties experienced in predicting business buyers' price sensitivity. With a view to obviating these obstacles, this study examines the effect of five key physical distribution service quality dimensions on price sensitivity from the perspective of small and medium retail buyers. Based on a survey of 233 cellular phone retailers in China, the authors articulate how the five salient service quality dimensions exert either direct effects on price sensitivity or indirect impacts through perceived value and customer satisfaction. Theoretical and managerial implications are also provided for effective retailer relationship management, profitability improvement, and customer segmentation in distribution channels.

AB  - Given the large investments in mobile data services (MDS), it has become important to understand customers' decision-making processes as they pertain to the adoption and use of MDS. In the telecommunication domain, understanding the distinction between potential adopters and existing users is an important issue, as the use of information and communication technologies is associated with what has become known as the digital divide. This study attempts to develop a theoretical framework that identifies utilitarian and hedonic values as the key predictors of MDS acceptance and continuance. It also investigates the difference in the determinants between potential adopters and existing users. The proposed research model is empirically tested by using survey data collected from 120 potential adopters and 354 existing users. The results of structural equation modeling (SEM) show that the proposed research model provides a significant explanation of the variance of adoption intention and continued usage intention toward MDS. This study also clarifies the moderating role of direct experience with MDS in behavioral intention toward it. The results of this study would provide some guidelines to overcoming the digital divide in the context of MDS. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to perform an in situ assessment of office seating habits that influence chair testing and design.
   Background: Many chair testing parameters were derived decades ago when the average weight of people within the United States was dramatically lower and the office work tasks less computer based.
   Method: For the study, 51 participants were randomly selected from Brazos Valley, Texas, businesses to participate in 8-hr assessments of office seating habits. Overall results were compared with current chair testing and design assumptions. Data were collected through written survey and through data logging of seat and back contact pressure and duration with the use of the X-SENSOR (TM) pressure mapping device and software. Additionally, 1 day per participant of caster roll distance was recorded with the use of a caster mounted digital encoder. Participants were grouped by body mass index (BMI) and weight (BMI < 35 and weight < 102 kg or BMI > 35 and weight > 102 kg).
   Results: It was determined that a significant difference did exist between the groups in mean seat time per shift (p < .001), back cycles per shift (p < .002), seat cycles per shift (p < .01), and caster distance rolled per shift (p < .001).
   Conclusion: Several key parameters and assumptions of current chair test methods and design specifications may no longer be valid for the upper quartile of weight range of the current U.S. population.
   Application: The data collected in this study will enable engineers to determine whether revision of design standards for testing office seating for both normal weight and extremely obese workers is indicated.

AB  - In this study, we examine the price process of eBay online auctions. We pool sparse and unevenly spaced bidding histories of individual auctions, resulting in an unbalanced panel of bids. Since the price processes of online auctions are monotonically increasing within individual auctions and exhibit a substantial degree of heterogeneity, we propose a monotone series estimator for panel data with auction-specific slopes for a common relative price growth curve. We generalize Ramsay's (1998, J R Stat Soc B 60(2):365-375) monotone series estimator to fit our panel model of the price process. We apply the proposed model and estimator to eBay auctions of a popular hand-held device (a Palm PDA). The results are shown to capture closely the overall pattern of observed price dynamics. In particular, the early bidding, mid-auction bidding drought, and end-auction bid sniping are well approximated by the estimated price curve.

AB  - In this paper, the authors define political individualization as a form of networked individualism. This process consists of two components: social individualization and political networking. Social individualization means that people are becoming less strongly connected to traditional communities and experiencing highly differentiated sociability. Political networking refers to the shift from stable connections to formal political movements to dynamic connections to issue networks. This article attempts to investigate whether this process of political individualization is positively related to the use of new media such as the Internet and mobile telephones. There could be two arguments why these two would be positively related. First, the use of new media drives political individualization; the use of new media stimulates individualization since it creates opportunities for individuals to create social connections outside of existing communities. New media also facilitate the formation of political networks. Second, the use of new media and political individualization are both manifestations of a broader process of societal change. The process of modernization results in increasing autonomy of individuals and growing use of technology. This paper does not test these two explanations but rather investigates whether the grounds for both arguments actually exist. The authors have formulated the following research question: Do the new media create opportunities for political individualization and how are these opportunities used? Data from an international survey (918 web questionnaires) of young people in two European cities - Florence and Utrecht - has been used to investigate the research question.

AB  - Despite the ubiquitous use of new communication technologies, gaps in our knowledge remain regarding who is likely to rely on particular technologies and potential ramifications of these forms of communication on individuals' relationships and adjustment. In an online survey, 211 college students reported on their use of electronic communication with a parent who they identified as their closest family member. Results indicated that students who report more frequent phone conversations with parents also report more satisfying, intimate, and supportive parental relationships, but those students who use a social-networking site to communicate with parents report higher levels of loneliness, anxious attachment, as well as conflict within the parental relationship. The findings offer new evidence on how electronic communication technology with parents is related to adjustment in college students. Our study also suggests that further research is needed using longitudinal designs to understand better young adults' use of technology to communicate in today's society.

AB  - Previous studies have defined a new type of impairment in which an able-bodied user's behaviour is impaired by both the characteristics of a device and the environment in which it is used. This behavioural change is defined as a situationally-induced impairment and is often associated with small devices used in a mobile setting or constrained environment. Relatively little is known of its extent or the magnitude of the problems faced by the user. Here, we place the work that has been undertaken into a comparative framework of impairment in the context of data input. Our survey finds that 12 problems exist which define all impaired input and we look to understand the similarities and possible solutions in the new impairment group of small device users. For instance, from the literature, we find that users who are both situationally and motor impaired: press keys more than once, do not use enough force and so a key is not activated, and accidentally type keys in reverse order. A wealth of other errors exist in the motor impaired domain but work does not exist to support their existence in the situational domain. However, if commonalities exist for some - it seems work should be enacted to uncover the commonalities of all. Establishing these possible commonalities is important because solutions from one domain can be leveraged into another thereby saving the need to reinvent interventions which already exist elsewhere.

AB  - This study examined relations between a cross-cultural geographically mobile childhood and adulthood cultural homelessness, attachment to cross-cultural identities, and self esteem. Cross-cultural identities are loosely defined identities (e.g., third culture kids, military brats, missionary kids) that describe some individuals' childhood cross-cultural experience. The 475 participants spent at least two years before age 18 in a country different from their parents' home culture, then returned to the latter. They completed an online survey which included general demographic information regarding cross-cultural experiences in childhood, as well as the Cultural Homelessness Criteria, the Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale, and items that evaluated the strength of affirmation, belonging, and commitment to a self-labeled cross-cultural identity. Cultural homelessness was related to lower self esteem scores; higher affirmation, belonging and commitment to any cross-cultural identity was related to higher self esteem and lower cultural homelessness. Furthermore, such affirmation, belonging, and commitment buffered the cultural homelessness-self esteem association, whereas just having a cross-cultural identity did not. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - At first glance, mobile technology appears to have the potential to allow countries in Africa to technologically 'leapfrog' across the digital divide and provide much needed Internet access to a wide range of people currently unable to participate in the Information Society. This study investigates whether this potential is being actualized through the survey of a non-purposive sample population living in Johannesburg, South Africa. Studies have shown that aside from being able to engage with the new technology, people must also perceive it as reliable and user friendly. As such, this article examines user's attitudes and current behaviour with regards to this apparently highly accessible and relatively affordable medium. It also seeks to determine whether people believe that mobile technology could eclipse (or leapfrog) the use of computer technology for online activities - and if they believe that to be true, how have their usage patterns shifted, if at all?

AB  - GIS elemental unit representations of spatial data are often defined in terms of points, lines and areas. However, another type of spatial data that is becoming frequently captured, but as yet is largely ignored in GIS, is that of video. While digital video recording is a commonly encountered medium in modern society and encompasses many forms, from simple personal camcorders through to sophisticated survey and surveillance systems, its geographical representation in a GIS has not been fully examined or realised. In the majority of cases the video footage is usually captured while the device and/or the objects being viewed are in motion. What is of particular interest is when video streams can be, or have been, associated with spatial data such as location and orientation to create geographically referenced videographic data, which, for simplicity, will be defined as spatial video. Fundamentally, the nature of video is to record space, so when spatial properties can be accurately acquired and associated with this footage, an important geographical element can be considered for integration and analysis within a GIS.
   Existing spatial video systems, both commercial and research, are predominantly used in survey or LBS roles and are usually bespoke and application specific. These systems do not model spatial video to any recognised standards that is generalised to be both data and platform independent. They do not support GIS integration and/or analysis from a purely spatial content perspective. A video-image/remote-sensing centric approach prevails where usage options range from simple visualisation interfaces to interactive computer vision systems. What has been largely overlooked is a spatial approach where the inherent geographical extent recorded in each video frame can be modelled and used in a geo-spatial analysis context. While this modelling approach has not been fully realised, it does exist in a GIS form based on Open Geospatial Consortium standards, where the spatial context of video is defined in a structure called a ViewCone. However, a ViewCone only defines a 2D model of the geographical extent of each frame and is restricted to a three-or-five sided polygon representation.
   Thus, this article examines the potential of modelling spatial video through the use of elemental data types within GIS; gives some examples of using this approach; describes some problems in using spatial video within GIS; and then demonstrates how these problems are being solved. This is done in three stages: Firstly, a detailed overview of spatial video in its current GIS role is provided - this is achieved through a complete introduction to the distinct elements of spatial video followed by a review of its use in both commercial and academic application areas. Secondly, a brief theoretical overview of an alternative GIS-constrained ViewCone data structure is given that defines a more flexible spatial video model for both 2D and 3D GIS analysis and visualisation. Thirdly, a selective sample of results is presented based on an implementation of this approach being applied to a constrained spatial video data source in a specific study area.

AB  - This paper introduces and explores cycles of pre-produsage and produsage. It reports on the results from an online ethnographical study of the Apple iPad conducted before the public release of the material product. Consequently, most users had not physically interacted with the device in question. Nevertheless, the release of the technical specifications and marketing material generated a massive amount of produsage-related online discussion. As such this paper explores the concept of pre-produsage. Pre-produsage is a form of predicted or expected use, relating to products or services that are only accessible to users as a form of representation (e.g. technical specification, virtual prototype, and design sketch), but with an added element of user-generated design suggestions, conflict coordination, and software development. Remediationthe process by which new digital media technologies reuses qualities of previous technologies and enters an existing media ecologyis a prevalent theme in pre-produsage and involves a tension between features that support protracted use and features that provide total innovation. The paper argues that an analysis of pre-produsage can provide insights that relate to both anticipated and actual user experience (UX). More specifically, pre-produsage analysis can trace the underlying reasons for a certain problem, intention, or concern and connect it to a specific set of features and potential solutions. Finally, the paper shows how proprietary products become subject to produsage, resulting in artifacts negotiated by cycles of produsage.

AB  - Little is known about the psychological underpinnings of young people's mobile phone behaviour. In the present research, 292 young Australians, aged 16-24 years, completed an online survey assessing the effects of self-identity, in-group norm, the need to belong, and self-esteem on their frequency of mobile phone use and mobile phone involvement, conceptualised as people's degree of cognitive and behavioural association with their mobile phone. Structural equation modelling revealed that age (younger) and self-identity significantly predicted the frequency of mobile phone use. In contrast, age (younger), gender (female), self-identity and in-group norm predicted young people's mobile phone involvement. Neither self-esteem nor the need to belong significantly predicted mobile phone behaviour. The present study contributes to our understanding of this phenomenon and provides an indication of the characteristics of young people who may become highly involved with their mobile phone.

AB  - This study examines the relationships among corporate image, brand awareness, service price, service quality, customer support services, and customer loyalty, and investigates the key drivers that establish and maintain customer loyalty to mobile telecommunications service providers. Four hundred and sixty-nine samples, which were collected from participants in a web-based survey in Korea, were analyzed using multiple regression analysis techniques. The results of the study show that corporate image, brand awareness, service price, and service quality are strong antecedents for establishing customer loyalty in mobile communications service markets. In addition, the empirical findings show that corporate image plays the most important role in establishing and maintaining customer loyalty in the markets. Based on the findings of the study, we discuss possible strategies for marketing success in high-tech service markets.

AB  - The advancement of wireless and mobile technologies has enabled students to learn in an environment that combines learning resources from both the real world and the digital world. Although such an approach has been recognized as being innovative and important, several problems have been revealed in practical learning activities. One major problem is owing to the lack of proper learning strategies or tools for assisting the students to acquire knowledge in such a complex learning scenario. Students might feel excited or engaged when using the mobile devices to learn in the real context; nevertheless, their learning achievements could be disappointing. To deal with this problem, this study presents a mobile learning system that employs Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to detect and examine real-world learning behaviors of students. This study also utilizes each student's responses from a two-tier test (i.e., multiple-choice questions in a two-level format) to provide personalized learning guidance (called two-tier test guiding, T(3)G). The experimental results from a natural science course of an elementary school show that this innovative approach is able to improve the learning achievements of students as well as enhance their learning motivation.

Four categories are created on the basis of two variables, namely, the penetration and rate of growth of mobile phones. The paper answers questions such as: Which countries do well and badly on both variables? Are the countries in these categories drawn from specific regions or similar income levels or is the distribution more random? How can similar countries from the same region appear in two diametrically opposite categories? What does this imply for policy?.

AB  - Despite higher hit rates for cell phone samples, inefficiencies in processing calls to these numbers relative to landline numbers continue to be documented in the U. S. literature. In this study, we propose one method for using cell phone provider information and Internet resources for validating number status. Specifically, we describe how we used "in network'' options available from three major providers' web sites to determine the validity of cell phone numbers. We tested differences in working number rates (WNRs) among valid and nonvalid numbers against a normal processing control group and determined that the WNR among valid numbers was approximately 14 percentage points higher than the WNR of the comparison group. This process also shows promise in reducing the effort required to determine working status and may provide a basis for developing screening tools for cell phones that capitalize on resources that are unique to this technology.

Ninety-two adults were randomly selected and provided with mobile devices to complete weekly web surveys. Experiments were designed to address three main objectives. First, the authors test fundamental findings which have been found robust across other modes, but whose impact may be diminished in mobile web surveys (due largely to the device), by manipulating question order and scale frequencies. Second, the authors test findings from experiments in computer-administered web surveys, altering the presentation of images and the number of questions per page. Third, the authors experiment with the unique display, navigation, and input methods, through the need to scroll, the vertical versus horizontal orientation of scales, and the willingness to provide open-ended responses. Although most findings from other modes are upheld, the small screen and keyboard introduce undesirable differences in responses.

AB  - In recent years, mobile phones have become an increasingly important component in survey data collection. This holds true for self-administered questionnaires and particularly for interview surveys, where mobile phones enforce the combination with other survey modes. However, whether to include mobile phones in a particular survey design depends on complex cost-error relationships. To address this issue, the authors elaborate a metric-based on a product of costs and estimates of survey errors-that is then used for post survey comparison of design alternatives. The authors illustrate this approach with a simulation study using parameters from empirical research. The results show that such evaluation can potentially change the selection of the preferred design option compared to situations where only some of the components (e. g., response rate, nonresponse bias) are used for evaluation. More specifically, the decision about the inclusion of mobile phones predominantly depends on their bias-removing potential, while it is much less sensitive to changes in costs and other error parameters.

AB  - In recent years, there has been a growing interest in finding stronger means of securitising identity against the various risks presented by the mobile globalised world. Biometric technology has featured quite prominently on the policy and security agenda of many countries. It is being promoted as the solution du jour for protecting and managing the uniqueness of identity in order to combat identity theft and fraud, crime and terrorism, illegal work and employment, and to efficiently govern various domains and services including asylum, immigration and social welfare. In this paper, I shall interrogate the ways in which biometrics is about the uniqueness of identity and what kind of identity biometrics is concerned with. I argue that in posing such questions at the outset, we can start delimiting the distinctive bioethical stakes of biometrics beyond the all-too-familiar concerns of privacy, data protection and the like. I take cue mostly from Cavarero's Arendt-inspired distinction between the "what" and the "who" elements of a person, and from Ricoeur's distinction between the "idem" and "ipse" versions of identity. By engaging with these philosophical distinctions and concepts, and with particular reference to the example of asylum policy, I seek to examine and emphasise an important ethical issue pertaining to the practice of biometric identification. This issue relates mainly to the paradigmatic shift from the biographical story (which for so long has been the means by which an asylum application is assessed) to bio-digital samples (that are now the basis for managing and controlling the identities of asylum applicants). The purging of identity from its narrative dimension lies at the core of biometric technology's overzealous aspiration to accuracy, precision and objectivity, and raises one of the most pressing bioethical questions vis-A -vis the realm of identification.

AB  - This study examines factors influencing adoption and use of computer-based voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) phone service and attempts to integrate 2 theoretical approaches: the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the uses and gratifications framework. Using data from an online survey of VoIP users (N = 420), structural equation modeling analyses revealed that perceived ease of use had a significant impact on perceived usefulness. In addition, perceived usefulness had a positive effect on actual VoIP use. The study further discovered that motivations for communication and instrumental use significantly affected perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and actual VoIP use. This study suggests that integration of TAM and uses and gratifications can be fruitful in understanding user acceptance of new communication technologies.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the social adoption of the mobile phone by Irish teenagers in city, town and rural settings. It aims to investigate two key areas that have influenced the teenagers' social adoption of the mobile phone: first, the influence of locational and socio-economic factors on mobile phone usage; second, how the teenagers' adoption of recently emergent Web 2.0 applications (social-networking web sites and instant messaging services) tends to bring about a re-positioning of the mobile phone's role as a communications channel.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper draws on a social shaping and domestication of media technologies approach, using original empirical data from a survey of teenage respondents and six focus groups.
   Findings - The findings suggest that the teenagers' relationship to the mobile phone is evolving as newer communications applications emerge. In particular, the technical competencies and media literacies necessary for multi-model communication are evolving fastest where locational and socio-economic conditions are most favourable.
   Originality/value - Although access to the mobile phone cuts across the strata of society, people's capacity to benefit from it - and from other forms of multi-modal communication - is not evenly distributed. The paper argues that, despite universal ownership of the technological device among the sample of teenagers, the mobile phone is caught up in wider digital and socio-economic divides.

AB  - Recent developments in computing and mobile technologies have enabled the mobile and ubiquitous teaming approach, which situates students in an environment that combines real-world and digital-world learning resources. Although such an approach seems to be innovative and interesting, several problems have been revealed when applying it to practical learning activities. One major problem is owing to the lack of proper learning strategies or tools that can guide or assist the students to learn in such a complex learning scenario. Students might feel excited or interested when using the mobile devices to learn in the real world; however, their learning achievements could be disappointing. To cope with this problem, in this study, a knowledge engineering approach is proposed to develop Mindtools for such innovative learning scenarios. Experimental results from a natural science course of an elementary school show that this innovative approach not only enhances learning motivation, but also improves the learning achievements of the students.

AB  - 'The way we are now' is an innovative photo-ethnographic project. It originates from both practice led research into creativity, technology and embodied mind funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, and research into wellbeing, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council. The research into creativity is underpinned by the writings of Merleau-Ponty, including his claim 'that modes of thought correspond to technical methods', and that to use Goethe's phrase 'what is inside is also outside', a position similar to that taken by social anthropologists seeing technology as skilled practice. The research into activity and well-being in daily life uses the experience sampling method (ESM). Traditionally, the method uses questionnaire diaries and electronic pagers which are pre-programmed to bleep at randomly selected times during the day to indicate response times. The research discussed here uses a mobile phone to indicate responses eight times a day for seven consecutive days, extended to include images taken at each signal with the mobile phone/camera, which has not been done before. The research extends both the subject matter of digital fine art, and the portrayal of subjective well-being and quality of life.

AB  - This study aimed to explore what factors influence mobile media users' adoption of new services and whether the adoption models differ depending on users' motives to use mobile media. The decomposed Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) and uses and gratifications theory were used as theoretical frameworks. Methodologically, an online survey was conducted with 400 Korean mobile users and structural equation modelling was employed. As a result, the proposed model explained well users' adoption intention for new mobile services. Especially, high- and low-motive groups showed significant differences in terms of the influence of subjective norms and Perceived Behavioural Control (PBC).

On the basis of an extensive review of literature in Task Technology Fit (TTF) theory and Mobile Commerce (MC) adoption, a revised TTF model is proposed and tested using data collected from an online survey of 440 respondents. The results show that: the fit between task and technology positively affects MSMS usage, while alternative systems play a negative role; functions of MSMS, self-efficacy and experience are important factors affecting the fit; MSMS adopting does not heavily depend on the macro-environment of the stock market. Implications for improving other types of MC applications adoption are discussed.

AB  - Text messaging is an asynchronous communication tool for both utilitarian and entertainment activities. The purpose of this study is to investigate the self-determined motivation of text messaging behaviours through Self-Determination Theory (SDT). Data collected via a web-based survey were used to examine the effects of autonomy, competence and relatedness on self-determined Short Message Service (SMS). Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) revealed that only competency and relatedness increase self-determined SMS, while autonomy affected it negatively. The result implies that the ability to engage in personal communication and the desire to become socially connected are the essence of SMS internal motivation. This study also suggests that higher self-determined information technology usage reduces freedom to disengage from it and that obligated communication becomes another determining factor of usage. Practitioners and researchers can benefit from these findings by incorporating self-determined usage behaviours into work play aspects of modern day ubiquitous computing usage.

AB  - Purpose - This study aims to identify distinct online media user segments on the basis of three media theories, namely media displacement theory, media complementarity theory and media richness theory
   Design/methodology/approach - A largescale, mobile-based web survey was conducted in Japan to assess behavioural variables (media time allocation, media richness perceptions, and media access motives) and demographics
   Findings - The latent class model reveals four distinct media user segments dual media users (i.e, users of the internet on both the mobile and the PC), mobile internet suers. PC internet users, and passive online users Dual media users are likely to spend more time on information searching, perceive greater levels of media richness in online media, and share common motives for accessing internet media via both mobile and PC The findings are consistent with our theoretical expectations
   Research limitations and implications - Any exploratory clustering of consumers is by definition a snapshot that depends on time and place Consequently the findings would very likely have been different if the underlying data had been sampled at another time of in different locations Despite this limitation the findings corroborate some of the basic tenets of theories of media competition and complementarity
   Practical implications - The fact that almost a third of online media users access internet content via both mobile and PC suggests the increasing importance of cross-media strategies
   Originality/value - This is a pioneering study that examines media competitions and complementarity between the mobile internet and the PC internet

AB  - This study investigates the popularity of mobile messaging as a social medium. Using data from an Internet questionnaire (N = 635) on the use of the short message service (SMS) for mobile phone text messaging ('texting'), we examine two components of an affordance pathways hypothesis of SMS uptake: (1) mobile phone users must first discover and make use of hidden social affordances of texting in order to obtain significant interpersonal benefit from the medium, and (2) key social and psychological variables differentially predispose users to capitalise on these affordances. We developed and validated latent factor measures of texting affordances and relationship outcomes, examined the differential effects of a range of predictor variables on these measures, and tested a model in which the expressive and conversational use of texting mediates the effects of social anxiety, loneliness, age, and relationship status on relationship outcomes. This model proved a significant fit to the data, and was superior to alternative models which systematically varied the causal priority of SMS affordances and relationship outcomes. The results suggest that young, single, and socially anxious mobile phone users are predisposed to recognise and take advantage of the social functionality of SMS to enrich their personal relationships.

AB  - This exploratory research considers the implications to actual world (AW) nations and attachments of an online virtual world (OVW) which mimics so many aspects of AW nation-states. Using Lessing's interrogation of mimesis as a framing device, this paper presents the results of a quantitative investigation that examines the relationship between the competing loyalties of AW nations and the OVW of Second Life (SL). To that end, a subsample of 212 members of SL completed an online survey which measured five aspects of the national and SL attachment, including a section in which participants ranked their concern for fellow co-nationals (CNs) versus their concern for fellow Second Lifers (SLers). Analyses of the data produced four main findings. First, 45 per cent of participants ranked their concern for their fellow SLers above that of their fellow CNs. Second, those who preferred SLers were significantly less attached to their AW nations than those who preferred CNs. Third, the SLer-preferred, on average, considered SL to be like a world, while the CN-preferred were more ambivalent in this regard. Fourth, gender differences indicate that males who preferred SLers spent most of their time in the SL engaged in activities while females who preferred SLers spent most of their time in the SL engaged in communicatory socializing. Discussion of these results focuses on notions of cosmopolitanism versus nation-statehood and uses the category of gender to illustrate the implications of mimesis to the durability of the phenomenon of nation-statehood.

AB  - Handsets are being transformed from the traditional cellular phone to an integrated content delivery platform for communications, Their increasing capabilities and value-added features provide more utilities, and at the same time, make the design more complicated and the devices more difficult to use. The objective of this study was to explore and identify the critical factors that predicate the handset's perceived usability. An online survey was conducted by using a seven-point Likert-scale structured questionnaire tailored to measure the user's perception of the usability level of their current handset. A total of nine usability dimensions were derived from the results of exploratory factor analysis. The total variance explained by these nine factors was 65.20% of the overall variance of the data. Relationships between the nine usability factors and handset design features were described by regression models.

   Design/methodology/approach - Based on 305 valid responses collected from a survey questionnaire, structural equation modeling (SEM) technology was employed to examine the research model.
   Findings - The results show that both information quality and system quality significantly affect users' trust and flow experiences, which further determine their loyalty. The results indicate that flow experience is the strongest determinant of users' loyalty.
   Practical implications - Mobile SNS providers need to consider user experience when seeking users' loyalty. They should enhance information quality and system quality in order to improve user trust and flow experience.
   Originality/value - Although much research has been conducted to explore the effects of extrinsic motivations, such as perceived usefulness, on mobile commerce user behavior, the effect of intrinsic motivations, such as flow experience, is seldom tested. This research found the effect of flow experience on mobile SNS users' loyalty to be significant.

AB  - The substantial growth in mobile handheld technologies has heralded the opportunity to provide physicians with access to information, resources, and people at the right time and place. But is this technology delivering the benefits to workflow and patient care promised by increased mobility? The authors conducted a systematic review to examine evidence regarding the impact of mobile handheld technology on hospital physicians' work practices and patient care, focusing on quantification of the espoused virtues of mobile technologies. The authors identified thirteen studies that demonstrated the ability of personal digital assistants (PDAs) to positively impact on areas of rapid response, error prevention, and data management and accessibility. The use of PDAs demonstrates the greatest benefits in contexts where time is a critical factor and a rapid response crucial. However, the extent to which these devices improved outcomes and workflow efficiencies because of their mobility was largely absent from the literature. The paucity of evidence calls for much needed future research that asks explicit questions about the impact the mobility of devices has on work practices and outcomes.

AB  - Objective: To compare users' speed, number of entry errors and satisfaction in using two current devices for electronic data collection in clinical research: handheld and laptop computers.
   Design: The authors performed a randomized cross-over trial using 160 different paper-based questionnaires and representing altogether 45,440 variables. Four data coders were instructed to record, according to a random predefined and equally balanced sequence, the content of these questionnaires either on a laptop or on a handheld computer. Instructions on the kind of device to be used were provided to data-coders in individual sealed and opaque envelopes. Study conditions were controlled and the data entry process performed in a quiet environment.
   Measurements: The authors compared the duration of the data recording process, the number of errors and users' satisfaction with the two devices. The authors divided errors into two separate categories, typing and missing data errors. The original paper-based questionnaire was used as a gold-standard.
   Results: The overall duration of the recording process was significantly reduced (2.0 versus 3.3 min) when data were recorded on the laptop computer (p < 0.001). Data accuracy also improved. There were 5.8 typing errors per 1,000 entries with the laptop compared to 8.4 per 1,000 with the handheld computer (p < 0.001). The difference was even more important for missing data which decreased from 22.8 to 2.9 per 1,000 entries when a laptop was used (p < 0.001.). Users found the laptop easier, faster and more satisfying to use than the handheld computer.
   Conclusions: Despite the increasing use of handheld computers for electronic data collection in clinical research, these devices should be used with caution. They double the duration of the data entry process and significantly increase the risk of typing errors and missing data. This may become a particularly crucial issue in Studies where these devices are provided to patients or healthcare workers, unfamiliar with Computer Technologies, for self-reporting or research data collection processes.

AB  - This research represents a theoretical extension of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), which IS researchers have used to explain technologies' perceived usefulness and individuals intention to use it. The authors developed a model, referred to as the Mobile Wireless Technology Acceptance Model (MWTAM), to test the relationship between theoretical constructs spanning technological influence processes (Perceived Ubiquity, and Perceived Reachability) and cognitive influence processes (Job Relevance, Perceived Usefulness, and Perceived Ease of Use) and their impact on Behavioral Intention. MWTAM is assessed using data collected from an online survey and analyzed using AMOS 5.0. Results provide evidence to support MWTAM as both the technological and cognitive influence processes accounted for 58.7% of the variance explained in an individual's Behavioral Intention toward using mobile wireless technology. Additionally, the path coefficients between constructs ranged from 0.241 to 0.572 providing further evidence to support the theoretical extension of TAM.

AB  - This study examines the role and explanatory value of context-, task- and information-related characteristics vis-a-vis individual characteristics in relation with respect to the adoption of mobile technologies and applications. We combine insights from adoption and acceptance literature with media choice and task- technology fit theories. These insights are applied to a case in which police officers use mobile communication tools and information technologies. Officers were asked which mobile applications they preferred to use in specific situations (contexts) and for specific tasks. In a structural equation model focusing exclusively on individual TAM-related characteristics, such as perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, as well as on a generic media fit concept, the explanatory value of these concepts turns out to be high. We extend our study, based on Ajzen and Madden (1986) by arguing that, in addition to personal characteristics, contextual characteristics, in combination with task- related characteristics, play an important role in people's preferences for specific technologies. Conjoint analysis focusing on contextual and task- related characteristics yields relevant insights. When context-related and individual characteristics are combined into a single hierarchical linear model, the significance of the concepts used in TAM turns out to be low, while context- related issues stand out. On the basis of our research, we conclude that TAM models are too generic to fully explain people's intention to use mobile technologies. Future research should aim at developing models that take contextual and task- related factors into account when studying mobile applications.

AB  - The importance of information and communication technology (ICT) in economic development has been increasing rapidly along with the Internet and mobile telecommunication networks. ICT development is becoming a main growth factor of many countries. As they realize the importance of the ICT industry, developing nations work to catch up with established economies. Therefore, many nations are formulating an ICT-enhanced policy. This paper introduces a number of telecommunication and broadcasting sub-indices, which include the fixed telephone network, the Internet, and mobile networks, which are aggregated into a composite Telecommunication Index (TI). The indices are computed using principal component analysis and human development type index methods. The country rankings, by different ICT-related indices, help identify the strengths and weaknesses of infrastructure development such that each country can foster economic growth. The performance of TI is compared with several other indices, such as the digital access, human development, and ArCo technology indices. The type of indices affects the country ratings. Results suggest that the parametric index approach may be preferred over those methods in which the subjective weighted summation of normalized variables used (non-parametric indices).

KW  - Place-Specific Computing
AB  - An increased interest in the notion of place has evolved in interaction design based on the proliferation of wireless infrastructures, developments in digital media, and a 'spatial turn' in computing. In this article, place-specific computing is suggested as a genre of interaction design that addresses the shaping of interactions among people, place-specific resources and global socio-technical networks, mediated by digital technology, and influenced by the structuring conditions of place. The theoretical grounding for place-specific computing is located in the meeting between conceptions of place in human geography and recent research in interaction design focusing on embodied interaction. Central themes in this grounding revolve around place and its relation to embodiment and practice, as well as the social, cultural and material aspects conditioning the enactment of place. Selected examples of place-specific computing are presented from a series of pilot studies, conducted in close collaboration with design students in Malmo, Berlin, Cape Town and Rome, that generated 36 design concepts in the genre. Reflecting on these examples, issues in the design of place-specific computing are discussed, as well as questions for further research concerning how digitally mediated interactions can be understood as elements of practiced place.

AB  - In this study, we assessed the status of electronic recruitment for U. S. state government employees and analyzed the issues and challenges state governments faced while they implemented e-recruitment systems. All of the 23 state personnel agencies that responded to a phone survey either offered downloadable application forms or allowed candidates to submit applications online. Ten states had adopted options for assessing applicants and selecting job candidates online, but only three states reported that they had adopted online testing. The number of applications received online increased from 2002 to 2003, and the most common implementation challenges that states faced when introducing e-recruitment were budget constraints, technical difficulties, and HR staff adapting to using a new system. While 15 states reported that they evaluated their electronic recruitment system, only three said they measured the cost per hire. Based on the survey responses, we conclude this article by presenting lessons and implications for effectively implementing e-recruitment for state government employees.

AB  - Although software engineers extensively use a component-based software engineering (CBSE) approach, existing usability questionnaires only support a holistic evaluation approach, which focuses on the usability of the system as a whole. Therefore, this paper discusses a component-specific questionnaire for measuring the perceived ease-of-use of individual interaction components. A theoretical framework is presented for this compositional evaluation approach, which builds on Taylor's layered protocol theory. The application and validity of the component-specific measure is evaluated by re-examining the results of four experiments. Here, participants were asked to use the questionnaire to evaluate a total of nine interaction components used in a mobile phone, a room thermostat, a web-enabled TV set and a calculator. The applicability of the questionnaire is discussed in the setting of a new usability study of an MP3 player. The findings suggest that at least part of the perceived usability of a product can be evaluated on a component-based level.

This stud), examined users' acceptance of automotive telematics. Following the theory comparison approach, we evaluated including the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) and Combined Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)-TPB model (C-TAM-TPB), that could explain users' automotive telematics acceptance decisions. The respective models were evaluated using web-based survey data collected from 345 users about their perceptions of automotive telematics. Overall, the results revealed that the effect of Perceived Ease Of Use, Attitude and Perceived Behavioural Control were very important but that usefulness and Subjective Norm did not influence an individual's Behavioural Intention. The implications of this study were also discussed.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the distributed presentation of different versions of a question would produce better performance on a new version of the question than distributed presentation of the same version of the question. A total of 48 four question sets of five alternative multiple-choice questions were presented during a college lecture course. The answers to all the four questions in each set required an inference from the same fact statement. One question in each set appeared on both a block exam and the final. Each of the other three questions was presented either on an online quiz before class, during class or on an online quiz a week after class. Answering different versions of a question before class, during class and after class resulted in better performance on a fourth version of the question on the exam and final than answering the same question before class, during class and after class. On the final exam, 44 questions were answered twice, first under a time constraint of 90 seconds and then when response time was unlimited. The two responses were virtually identical.

AB  - This study investigates factor that affect usage changes in mobile data services (MDS). First, we conducted an exploratory study based on 378 survey responses to learn about important decision factors of MDS usage. It revealed a discrepancy between the forces influencing usage increase and those of usage decrease. Based on the findings from the exploratory study and Hertzberg's two-factor theory, we postulated information quality as the motivator and system quality as the de-motivator of MDS usage. Then, we undertook a confirmative study on the respective roles of these factors in encouraging and discouraging the usage of MDS. We proposed a research model and empirically tested our hypotheses with partial least square (PLS) analysis based on 478 responses from MDS users. Information quality (as a motivator) was positively associated with MDS usage increase, but system quality (as a de-motivator) was not. Also, system quality was negatively associated with usage decrease, but information quality was not. Last, their association was partially moderated by the type of motivation for using MDS. Information quality had a storonger influences on MDS usage increase when the main motive was utilitarian rather than hedonic.

AB  - As online communication is more and more integrated in everyday life to support and maintain existing social ties, this study examined the factors associated with preference of face to face, phone or online conversations. A contextual framework that emphasizes the role of relationship origin, relationship intensity and content of communication on communication channel choice among adolescents was empirically tested. Based on a nationwide survey in Israel, it was found that communication content, relationship origin and place of residence affect the preference of face to face and online communication. Phone communication appears to be a more non specific channel to conduct personal and non personal conversations and relationship origin did not affect its use. These findings suggest that relationship origin is important, and face to face communication is preferred for ties that were initiated face to face and online communication for ties that were initiated online. For this sample of regular population, there is no indication that online communication tends to be personal or hyper personal. The use of all the communication channels is preferred to the maintenance of existing ties and is less used for the creation of new ties. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose - Mobile commerce (m-commerce) represents a new area of business opportunity. Past research has often focused on customer acceptance and its antecedents, rather than factors that build trust in m-commerce. The purpose of this paper is to provide an explanation of factors influencing customer trust towards vendors on the mobile internet.
   Design/methodology/approach - M-commerce relies on mobile technology and well-maintained service quality. This paper has applied the service quality model (SERVQUAL) and technology acceptance model (TAM), coupled with proposed quality factors in relation to m-commerce that, according to the literature, influence customer trust, to empirically test the formation of trust. The proposed model was empirically evaluated using online survey data from 212 experienced m-commerce customers.
   Findings - The results showed that despite customisation, brand image and satisfaction all directly affecting customer trust towards the vendor in m-commerce, customisation and brand image equally had a stronger direct effect on trust formation. In addition, interactivity and responsiveness had no direct impact, but had an indirect impact via satisfaction on trust towards the vendor.
   Practical implications - This paper contributes a theoretical understanding of factors that activate the development of trust towards the vendor. For vendors in general the results enable them to better develop customer trust in m-commerce.
   Originality/value - The paper verifies the effects of satisfaction and proposed quality factors on customer confidence in m-commerce. Moreover, this article validates the determinants of satisfaction.

The issues raised in the discussions were translated into an online survey of 100 people. This study revealed that older people are passive users of mobile phones, that they experience fear of consequences of using unfamiliar technology, and that most preferred design features are aids for declining functional abilities. Gender differences in preferred design features were observed, with women focusing oil haptic aids and men oil perceptual aids. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - From a low initial base it is not difficult for developing countries to close the relative digital divide with the developed countries. A more challenging and novel question is whether, because of leapfrogging and other latecomer advantages, developing countries have grown faster than developed from the same initial starting point. Or, is it the case rather that the disadvantages of being a latecomer exceed the advantages? Are there any pronounced outliers among the developing countries and what are their distinguishing characteristics? Using a number of methods and data sources I seek to answer these questions in a tentative but provocative manner. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite the growing importance of the online mobile gaming industry, little research has been undertaken to explain why consumers engage in this ubiquitous entertainment. This study attempts to develop an instrument to measure experiential value in online mobile gaming adoption. The proposed scale consists of seven first-order factors of experiential value: intrinsic enjoyment, escapism, efficiency, economic value, visual appeal, perceived novelty, and perceived risklessness. The survey obtained 164 usable responses from Japanese college students. The empirical data fit our first-order model well, indicating a high level of reliability as well as convergent and discriminant validity. The single second-order model also shows an acceptable model fit.

AB  - One of the ubiquitous technology fields that have received the most attention recently from technology communities worldwide is mobile radio frequency identification (RFID). Mobile handsets loaded with RFID readers enable the identification and retrieval of information on RFID tagged objects. In Korea, a variety of mobile RFID services are currently being piloted, and their commercial roll-out looks imminent. The goal of this study is to propose, ahead of the commercial launch of mobile RFID services, a customer satisfaction index (CSI) model for this service category and to then measure the CSI to derive practical implications for their providers and pointers related to the improvement of service. A web survey was conducted on Korean mobile phone subscribers who had participated in a mobile RFID pilot program. Using the results of this survey, we tested the CSI model and its hypotheses by employing a partial least-squares-based structural equation model analysis and calculated the index. We further conducted an importance-performance analysis in order to provide insights that may be useful for improving the quality of mobile RFID services.

The 286 sets of data collected in an online survey were tested against the model using SEM. Results supported my new model: the new constructs and variables accounted for 62.7% of the variance found in an individual's behavioral intention to use MWT. The path coefficients between the constructs ranged from 0.26 to 0.85 also supporting the model. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study examines the response rates for surveys used in organizational research. We analysed 1607 studies published in the years 2000 and 2005 in 17 refereed academic journals, and we identified 490 different studies that utilized surveys. We examined the response rates in these studies, which covered more than 100,000 organizations and 400,000 individual respondents. The average response rate for studies that utilized data collected from individuals was 52.7 percent with a standard deviation of 20.4, while the average response rate for studies that utilized data collected from organizations was 35.7 percent with a standard deviation of 18.8. Key insights from further analysis include relative stability in response rates in the past decade and higher response rates for journals published in the USA. The use of incentives was not found to be related to response rates and, for studies of organizations, the use of reminders was associated with lower response rates. Also, electronic data collection efforts (e. g. email, phone, web) resulted in response rates as high as or higher than traditional mail methodology. We discuss a number of implications and recommendations.

AB  - This study addresses why Japanese teenagers participate in mobile-based word-of-mouth (WOM) campaigns. It is posited that commitment to the promoted brand, relationship with the mobile device, and group-person connectivity act as antecedents of two primary gratifications of the campaign, entertainment value and purposive value, which in turn determine the direction and strength of the attitude-intention-behavior chain. A "real" mobile campaign was used as stimulus. Based on a random sampling method, 22,500 structured questionnaires were sent to young consumers, 13-18 years old, via mobile device. Our data fit the proposed model fairly well, and all hypothesized paths are supported. There are significant differences in the strength of the paths between teenagers who learned of the campaign from non-WOM sources (i.e., content-based Web sites and e-mail magazines) versus WOM sources (pass-along e-mail and direct referral). In closing, theoretical and managerial implications are discussed and important limitations are recognized. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The assessment of website quality is considered as a problem of measuring user satisfaction, in order to analyse user perceptions and preferences. The presented pilot user satisfaction survey concerns the major cellular phone service providers in Greece. The analysis is based on a multicriteria preference disaggregation approach for satisfaction benchmarking analysis and consists of the following parts: (1) the user satisfaction analysis, which concerns the identification of customer preferences and includes the estimation of the relative importance and the demanding level of the different user satisfaction dimensions, and (2) the satisfaction benchmarking analysis, which is mainly focused on the performance evaluation of the competitive organisations against the satisfaction criteria, as well as the identification of the competitive advantages of each company. The results presented in this paper demonstrate how business organisations may locate their position against competition, pinpoint their weak points and determine which website characteristics will improve their global performance.

AB  - To compare the effectiveness of different prenotification and invitation procedures in a web-based three-wave access panel survey over 3 consecutive months, we experimentally varied the contact mode in a fully crossed two-factorial design with (a) three different prenotification conditions (mobile short messaging service [SMS], e-mail, no prenotice) and (b) two "invitation and reminder" conditions (SMS, e-mail). A group with nearly complete mobile phone coverage was randomly assigned to one of these six experimental conditions. As expected, SMS prenotifications outperformed e-mail prenotifications in terms of response rates across all three waves. Furthermore, e-mail invitation response rates outperformed those for SMS invitations. The combination of SMS prenotification and e-mail invitation performed best. The different experimental treatments did not have an effect on the sample composition of respondents between groups.

AB  - Access to information via handheld devices supports decision making away from one's computer. However, limitations include small screens and constrained wireless bandwidth. We present a summarization method that transforms online content for delivery to small devices. Unlike previous algorithms, ours assumes nothing about document formatting, and induces a hierarchical structure based on the relative importance of sentences within the document. As compared to delivering full documents, the method reduces the bytes transferred by half. An experiment also demonstrates that when given hierarchical summaries, users are no less accurate in answering questions about the documents. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Studying the adoption and acceptance of Mobile Data Services (MDS) has been an intriguing endeavour for quite some time. Much of the related literature is inspired by the technology acceptance model and its heirs. The study presented in this paper adopts an alternative perspective and proposes the study of MDS actual usage patterns under the lens of the Triandis theory of explaining human behaviour. To this end, we adjust the concepts included in the original Triandis model to the MDS context and construct a model predicting MDS use. The model is empirically validated through a survey (N = 365) and tested for its predictive capacity against four different MDS categories (m-commerce, communication, information and entertainment services). Results suggest that the uptake of each of the four service categories is contingent upon a limited set of factors. In addition, financial barriers emerge as a universal inhibitor over and above specific service groupings.

I do so by way of a preliminary inquiry that seeks to explore the intersection between the emergence of mobiles in Australia with transformations in that country's sense of its relationship with Asia. First I discuss the history of the mobile phone in Australia, noting some important uses and representations that formed part of its social shaping. Second, I explore mobiles and the paradoxes of multiculturalism, and also how digital technologies became central to political culture and identity debates in Australia in the early to-mid 1990s. Third, I look at some important moments in the social shaping of text messaging, in which questions of cultural difference were decisive. Finally, I offer concluding remarks about future research on mobiles in Australia and how they are tied into Asian identities.

AB  - Although Mobile Data Services (MDS) are expected to revolutionise internet use, they have yet to do so, in part, because many users are not continuing with MDS after initial use. This study examines which factors are most important in converting discontinuers into continuers, and whether they differ from those that are effective in maintaining continuers. We conducted an online survey to compare continuers and discontinuers empirically in terms of the relative importance of seven post-adoption factors to the behavioural intention to use MDS. The results show that usefulness and social influence were more important for discontinuers, ubiquitous connectivity for continuers.
