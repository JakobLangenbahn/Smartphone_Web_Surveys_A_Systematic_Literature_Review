T1  - I <i>Ought</i> to Put Down That Phone but I Phub Nevertheless: Examining the Predictors of Phubbing Behavior
AN  - 2607606171
AB  - Smartphones are ubiquitous and frequently used in copresent interactions. This behavior is often seen as inappropriate and thus has been termed phubbing, compromising the words “phone” and “snubbing.” Although being a worldwide phenomenon, little is known about what predicts phubbing behavior in the first place. Drawing on injunctive norms (i.e., what ought to be done), the study’s aim was to shed light on the relationship between mobile phone norms (MPN) and phubbing behavior. Furthermore, the role of being permanently online and permanently connected (POPC) and fear of missing out (FOMO), reflecting approach and avoidance orientations, respectively, as additional predictors and moderators was investigated. As expected, the findings of an online survey (N = 278) supported the assumption that MPN were negatively related to phubbing behavior. Moreover, results showed that both FOMO and POPC were significantly positively connected to phubbing behavior but did not play significant moderating roles concerning the norm–phubbing relationship.

T1  - Improving the Use of Voice Recording in a Smartphone Survey
AN  - 2607554021
AB  - More and more respondents are answering web surveys using mobile devices. Mobile respondents tend to provide shorter responses to open questions than PC respondents. Using voice recording to answer open-ended questions could increase data quality and help engage groups usually underrepresented in web surveys. Revilla, Couper, Bosch, and Asensio showed that in particular the use of voice recording still presents many challenges, even if it could be a promising tool. This article reports results from a follow-up experiment in which the main goals were to (1) test whether different instructions on how to use the voice recording tool reduce technical and understanding problems, and thereby reduce item nonresponse while preserving data quality and the evaluation of the tool; (2) test whether nonresponse due to context can be reduced by using a filter question, and how this affects data quality and the tool evaluation; and (3) understand which factors affect nonresponse to open-ended questions using voice recording, and if these factors also affect data quality and the evaluation of the tool. The experiment was implemented within a smartphone web survey in Spain focused on Android devices. The results suggest that different instructions did not affect nonresponse to the open questions and had little effect on data quality for those who did answer. Introducing a filter to ensure that people were in a setting that permits voice recording seems useful. Despite efforts to reduce problems, a substantial proportion of respondents are still unwilling or unable to answer open questions using voice recording.

T1  - Failing to Perform Citizenship: Daily Narratives About Stockholm’s ‘vulnerable EU citizens’
AN  - 2605153111
AB  - The question of mobile Roma beggars in Europe has been analysed in terms of securitization, racialization, and deportability. These people have been hailed as ‘abject’ or ‘failed’ citizens, the problem of race being made largely invisible. In the Swedish context, the category of race does not emerge in overt form, and Swedes generally imagine themselves to be an egalitarian and just society. However, in Stockholm, in 2015, the unprecedented visibility of rough sleeping EU-migrants turned daily chance meetings tasks into ‘ethical encounters’. Using the concept of enacting citizenship and the Narrative Policy Framework, this article analyses day-to-day narratives about ‘vulnerable EU citizens’ constructed by the media and experts in the winter of 2015 in Stockholm. Most press narratives would silence the voices of migrants, framing them as passive victims, their problem being defined in terms of extreme temperature, thus making cold weather the principle villain. With regard to acts of citizenship, the paper analyses expert opinions on the migrants’ performance. Their stories and discourse reveal the image of a ‘vulnerable EU citizen’: one of a passive, begging, distressingly visible individual who is failing to perform citizenship. This shortcoming is regarded here as contributing to the justification of a wider policy framework in which the migrants’ claims are seen as unfounded and undeserved, while their attitude is viewed as unappreciative, although they would allegedly not be racialized as a group.

T1  - Digital Social Multitasking (DSMT), Friendship Quality, and Basic Psychological Needs Satisfaction Among Adolescents: Perceptions as Mediators
AN  - 2595781231
AB  - Most existing research assumes “phone use during face-to-face interactions” to be psychosocially detrimental. Drawing on the digital social multitasking framework, this study explored not only the negative but also positive implications of the behavior. A sample of 517 adolescents (Mage = 14.83, S.D. = 1.93; 50% female) recruited through the Qualtrics panel completed an online survey. Results showed that adolescents’ and their friend’s digital social multitasking were both associated with (1) greater perceived efficiency, which, in turn, was associated with competence need satisfaction, and (2) greater perceived connection, which, in turn, was associated with better friendship quality, autonomy need satisfaction, and relatedness need satisfaction. Adolescents’ own multitasking also had an indirect, negative relationship with friendship quality through perceived distraction, but friend’s multitasking did not compromise friendship quality. The study provides a more balanced picture, showing that despite the potential harm of digital social multitasking, adolescents’ phone use during face-to-face peer interactions also involves potential benefits for teens’ psychosocial well-being.

T1  - The taming of chaos: Optimal cities and the state of the art in urban systems research
AN  - 2591109700
AB  - What can urban big data research tell us about cities? While studying cities as complex systems offers a new perspective on urban dynamics, we should dig deeper into the epistemological claims made by these studies and ask what it means to distance the urban researcher from the city. Big data research has the tendency to flatten our perspective: it shows us technology users and their interactions with digital systems but does so often at the expense of the informal and irregular aspects of city life. It also presents us with the city as optimisable system, offering up the chance to engineer it for particular forms of efficiency or productivity. Both optimisation itself, and the process of ordering of the city for optimisation, confer political and economic power and produce a hierarchy of interests. This commentary advocates that researchers connect systems research to questions of structure and power. To do this requires a critical approach to what is missing, what is implied by the choices about which data to collect and how to make them available, and an understanding of the ontologies that shape both the data sets and the urban spaces they describe.

T1  - Associations Between Parental Maltreatment and Online Behavior Among Young Adolescents
AN  - 2582285577
AB  - Deviant behavior of adolescents in the online world has emerged as a serious social issue in South Korea. Given the urgent need to address new forms of risks related to technological advancement such as the Internet, this study examined the mechanisms of online deviant behavior among adolescents guided by general strain theory. Two waves of the nationally representative Korean Children and Youth Panel Study (N = 2184; Mage = 13.6 years) were used. The study examines whether the association between parental maltreatment (7th grade) and online deviant behavior (8th grade) is mediated by depression (8th grade), and further whether the mediating effect of depression (8th grade) on online deviant behavior (8th grade) is moderated by mobile phone dependency (8th grade). Depression mediated the relationship between parental maltreatment and online deviant behavior in the following year. A significant indirect and negative effect of parental maltreatment on online deviant behavior through depression was observed when levels of mobile phone dependency were low and moderate but not when mobile phone dependency was high. The findings demonstrated that adolescent’s depression and mobile phone dependency represent a key mechanism in determining the association between parental maltreatment and online deviant behavior. However, these findings may not be applicable for youth with the highest levels of mobile phone dependency.HighlightsAdopted general strain theory to examine the mechanism of online deviant behavior.Depression mediated the parental maltreatment and online deviant behavior relationship.Mobile phone dependency partially moderated the indirect effect of depression on online deviant behavior.

TT  - La vie en colocation&#xa0;: les cultures du domicile issues de la précarité et la nouvelle classe créative
AN  - 2580196332
AB  - The economy is entrenched in the domestic and the domestic enables the economy. We consider this dialectical relationship between the economy and ‘home’ through a case study of coliving, a new type of privately delivered shared housing emerging in response to increasingly precarious economic conditions. We examine how the proliferation of coliving signifies shifting meanings and cultures of home for digital nomads, the latest iteration of the creative class. We draw upon a content analysis of twenty websites of coliving organisations located in New York and San Francisco, United States of America. Our analysis uncovers emergent meanings and cultures of home that are strongly associated with economic conditions. We consider how the spatial manifestations of a precarious economy are supported by new homemaking practices and imaginaries of home – what may be termed home cultures of precarity. Coliving challenges conventional meanings of home: a reprieve from work, private, secure and inhabited long term. Instead, home is a capital accumulation technology for this cohort – a site for the active production of capital. The ideal home for the new creative class is a place of work that is mobile and social. The economy, meanings of home and homemaking practices are co-productive and co-emergent.Alternate abstract:RÉSUMÉL’économie est ancrée dans l’univers domestique, tandis que ce dernier permet l’économie. Nous étudions cette relation dialectique entre l’économie et le « chez-soi » à l’aide d’une étude sur la cohabitation, une nouvelle sorte de logement cohabitationnel privé en train de naître en réponse à la précarité croissante des conditions économiques. Nous examinons la manière dont la prolifération de cohabitations représente un changement dans les définitions et les cultures du domicile pour les nomades digitaux, la dernière incarnation de la classe créative. Nous nous appuyons sur une analyse du contenu de vingt sites internet d’associations de cohabitation à New York et San Francisco, aux États-Unis. Notre analyse révèle des définitions et des cultures du domicile nouvelles et qui sont étroitement liées aux conditions économiques. Nous examinons la manière dont les manifestations spatiales d’une économie précaire sont soutenues par de nouvelles pratiques pour créer et imaginer le domicile, ce que l’on pourrait appeler des cultures du domicile issues de la précarité. La cohabitation remet en question les définitions traditionnelles du domicile : un refuge loin du travail, privé, sûr, où l’on habite longtemps. Pour cette cohorte, le domicile est plutôt une technologie d’accumulation de capital, un endroit pour la production active de capital. Le domicile idéal pour la nouvelle classe créative est un lieu de travail mobile et communautaire. L’économie, les définitions du domicile et des pratiques de création de domicile sont coproductives et coémergentes

T1  - Using Smartphone Technology for Research on Refugees: Evidence from Germany
AN  - 2578342219
AB  - Researchers attempting to survey refugees over time face methodological issues because of the transient nature of the target population. In this article, we examine whether applying smartphone technology could alleviate these issues. We interviewed 529 refugees and afterward invited them to four follow-up mobile web surveys and to install a research app for passive mobile data collection. Our main findings are as follows: First, participation in mobile web surveys declines rapidly and is rather selective with significant coverage and nonresponse biases. Second, we do not find any factor predicting types of smartphone ownership, and only low reading proficiency is significantly correlated with app nonparticipation. However, obtaining sufficiently large samples is challenging—only 5 percent of the eligible refugees installed our app. Third, offering a 30 Euro incentive leads to a statistically insignificant increase in participation in passive mobile data collection.

T1  - Student Perceptions Towards the Use of the Mobile Flipped Classroom Approach
AN  - 2577502373
AB  - This study aimed at identifying students’ perception in terms of motivation, learning and engagement in using mobile flipped classroom approach based on Kolb’s Learning Cycle (1984). This quantitative study was conducted using a questionnaire to collect the data. The collected data was analyzed using descriptive analysis (percentage, means and standard deviations) utilizing the SPSS 20. The research took place in one of the top private universities in Malaysia and equipped with adequate free internet access. The researcher applied homogenous purposive sampling by selecting 40 undergraduate students registered in multimedia and computer animation course. The result showed that students had positive perceptions in terms of students’ motivation, learning and engagement in multimedia and animation course using mobile flipped classroom approach. Future research is recommended to focus on different age and a group of participants to obtain in-depth information on the implementation of mobile flipped classroom approach in a different context.

T1  - Proposing an M-Government Framework for the Ministry of Housing in Oman: For Efficient Digital Literacy and Services
AN  - 2577501174
AB  - In the dynamic world of technology, changes and transformations have emerged rapidly in recent years. Service providers such as government departments transformed their services from e-government to m-government for widespread customer reach. However, several issues existed that were obstructing the implementation of such a system by the Ministry of Housing in Oman, especially in rural areas. This study proposes a novel framework based on the fuzzy delphi and TOPSIS models to provide digital literacy and services. This framework considered the variables extracted from previous studies. Furthermore, a survey was conducted on 20 experts to determine the accepted variables. Thirty-five pre-service engineers evaluated the questionnaires using TOPSIS to determine the skills of pre-service engineers based on delphi criteria outcomes. The conceptual framework developed from the accepted results uses 11 different variables based on the TAM model. The study benefits the stakeholders in the area of m-government development.

T1  - Predicting Voting Behavior Using Digital Trace Data
AN  - 2569345686
AB  - A major concern arising from ubiquitous tracking of individuals’ online activity is that algorithms may be trained to predict personal sensitive information, even for users who do not wish to reveal such information. Although previous research has shown that digital trace data can accurately predict sociodemographic characteristics, little is known about the potentials of such data to predict sensitive outcomes. Against this background, we investigate in this article whether we can accurately predict voting behavior, which is considered personal sensitive information in Germany and subject to strict privacy regulations. Using records of web browsing and mobile device usage of about 2,000 online users eligible to vote in the 2017 German federal election combined with survey data from the same individuals, we find that online activities do not predict (self-reported) voting well in this population. These findings add to the debate about users’ limited control over (inaccurate) personal information flows.

T1  - Advancing English Language Learners' Speaking Skills Using VoiceThread in Mobile Learning for Russian Tertiary Context
AN  - 2578201762
AB  - This research examines the effectiveness of using the VoiceThread (VT) application (both web and mobile-based) for the development of oral English skills of Russian university students. The study involved 44 full-time bachelor students in non-linguistic departments. The results were evaluated by on-line questionnaire using SurveyMonkey. The survey indicated that the majority of students agreed that mobile VoiceThread developed their oral language skills (M = 4.75) and they enjoyed using it for language learning (M = 4.13). The novelty of the research lies in a more integral assessment of the entire set of oral linguistic skills as a result of their development using a specific mobile learning platform widely used throughout the world. The results can be used in practice to implement mobile learning platforms for teaching oral language skills to students with basic knowledge of a foreign language.

T1  - Who Cares? Social Mobility and the ‘Class Ceiling’ in Nursing
AN  - 2575270639
AB  - Nursing is often associated with providing working-class women a route to upward social mobility. This article argues that although nursing is a relatively open profession, the impact of social class endures, with the main division between nurses who are from higher professional backgrounds and the rest. We utilise the Great British Class Survey (GBCS) to explore nurses’ social origins; the relationship between background and economic, social, and cultural capital; and the impact of origin and capitals on income (and inferred career trajectory). While recognising the methodological limitations of the GBCS, we suggest there may be a ‘class ceiling’ in nursing, and that class advantages are still significant in lower professions of the public sector. Class identification endures regardless of whether nurses have been upwardly or downwardly mobile. We also suggest future directions for intragenerational mobility and gender in social mobility research and make a case for longitudinal and qualitative analysis of nurses’ trajectories. Our findings indicate that the downwardly mobile children of the middle classes retain their classed advantages as they establish their own careers.

T1  - Are digital platforms potential drivers of the populist vote? A comparative analysis of France, Germany and Italy
AN  - 2553408557
AB  - Populist parties are often argued to be very skilled in using digital media to attract supporters and strengthen linkages with their followers. However, only rarely has research shown this linkage empirically. This study explores whether arguments about the relation between digital platforms and populist voting can be substantiated using comparative survey data in France, Germany and Italy. Digital media include a variety of online platforms that can affect populist vote in different ways. This article addresses the relation between the political use of digital platforms and the populist vote. First, it looks at how the use of Social Networking Sites (SNS) and Mobile Instant Messaging Services (MIMS) is related to voting for populist parties. Second, it assesses whether the role of digital platforms is different for supporting digital ‘immigrant’ and digital ‘native’ populist parties. Third, it explores country differences in the relation between SNS and MIMS’ use and the populist vote. Using original online surveys, the article shows that political activities on SNS and MIMS platforms (sending messages or posting, discussing or convincing others to vote for a candidate) increase the probability of voting for populist parties. However, it also finds that the political use of digital media is associated with the populist vote under certain (and limited) circumstances, that is only for a subset of populist parties. Finally, it identifies important differences in how SNS and MIMS are linked to the populist vote in countries presenting diverse institutional features, web regulations and constellations of media systems.

T1  - Slider Bars in Multi-Device Web Surveys
AN  - 2548839424
AB  - This study explores some features of slider bars in the context of a multi-device web survey. Using data collected among the students of the University of Trento in 2015 and 2016 by means of two web surveys (N = 6,343 and 4,124) including two experiments, we investigated the effect of the initial position of the handle and the presence of numeric labels on answers provided using slider bars. It emerged that the initial position of the handle affected answers and that the number of rounded scores increased with numeric feedback. Smartphone respondents appeared more sensitive to the initial position of the handle but also less affected by the presence of numeric labels resulting in a lower tendency to rounding. Yet, outcomes on anchoring were inconclusive. Overall, no relevant differences have been detected between tablet and PC respondents. Understanding to what extent interactive and engaging tools such as slider bars can be successfully employed in multi-device surveys without affecting data quality is a key challenge for those who want to exploit the potential of web-based and multi-device data collection without undermining the quality of measurement.

T1  - Examining the Impact of a Survey’s Email Timing on Response Latency, Mobile Response Rates, and Breakoff Rates
AN  - 2548554108
AB  - The proportion of web survey responses submitted from mobile devices such as smartphones is increasing steadily. This trend presents new methodological challenges because mobile responses are often associated with increased breakoffs, which, in turn, can increase nonresponse bias. Using data from a survey of college students with more than 20,000 respondents, response patterns are examined to identify which days and times the survey invitation and reminder emails were most likely to produce nonmobile responses. The findings provide guidance on the optimal timing for recruiting college student sample members via email to reduce their likelihood of responding from a mobile device, and potentially, breaking off.

T1  - Parent Distraction with Technology and Child Social Competence during the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of Parental Emotional Stability
AN  - 2550962389
AB  - This study aimed to test the possible moderating role of parents’ emotional stability on the relationship between parent distraction with technology and child social competence during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data used in the study were collected in May 2020 when extensive restrictive measures, labeled as lockdown, were present in Croatia. Data on technoference in parenting, parents’ problematic phone tendencies, and child social competence were collected using an online questionnaire from parents (n = 281) of children aged 3 to 14 years. The results show a significant negative effect of overall technoference in parenting on child social competence. This negative effect was significantly moderated by parents’ emotional stability, as expected. Medium and high levels of parents’ emotional stability buffer the negative effect of low technoference in parenting on child social competence. Results imply technoference in parenting negatively affects child development, but the emotional stability of parents can be a protective factor.

T1  - Using digital tools and ethnography for rethinking disability inclusive city design - Exploring material and immaterial dialogues
AN  - 2546813486
AB  - Successful inclusion is a subject that addresses the question of how well a society can prevent discrimination and ensure access to information, products, services, and spaces for all. Disability may not necessarily lead to exclusion, unless society fails to respond to the needs of people regardless of their impairment. Digital tools combined with ethnographic research may help researchers explore users’ needs, perceptions, behaviors, and attitudes and can aid in understanding the interactions between the human, the space, and the digital within the urban realm. This paper thus outlines a diversity of digital tools in the context of the disability-inclusive city. Through ethnographic encounters with Joe, Ann, and Vanessa, we then explore how these tools can be applied to practice. Centering on Joe, we attempt to exemplify some of the key issues that need to be addressed when looking into the terrain of disability, the city, and digital tools.Points of interestThis paper explores how mobile phones and mobile applications can support people with disabilities in accessing the city and its services.The research also explores how modern technology, such as mobile applications can support city officials in understanding better what makes cities more disability friendly.With the help of Joe, Vanessa and Ann from Maribor, Slovenia, the authors have tried out a selected number of mobile applications and observed how these can help people with disabilities use the city and its services.The research with Joe, Vanessa and Ann showed that mobile phones and mobile applications can be useful for moving around the city, but people with disabilities may still face difficulties using mobile phones while moving.The research also showed that technology can make cities more disability friendly, but it cannot remove all the barriers that people with disabilities face in their everyday lives.

T1  - Smartphones as actors: A new digital disability care actor-network in China
AN  - 2540700423
AB  - Disability care is an understudied yet important phenomenon within the realm of caring media studies. It not only adds another identity-based lens for caring media studies but also proposes new questions at the intersection of media, disability and cultural studies. This study proposes a Chinese contextualized understanding of disability caring media, which may have broader implications in other contexts, even a global one. Mainly based on actor-network theory (ANT), this study looks at the smartphone as a new condition and a key actor in the emerging digital disability care actor-network to examine various modes of connections and associations, especially the application-network, the device-network, and the organization-network. This study seeks to provide a better understanding as to how meanings and technologies are enacted together in everyday caring practices, and how social dynamics are assembled and reassembled in contemporary disability caring media settings.

T1  - Competence, challenges and attitudes of bedside nurses caring for patients with left ventricular assist devices
AN  - 2503156394
AB  - ObjectivesWe aimed to describe the bedside registered nurses perceived competence, attitudes, and challenges surrounding the management of patients with left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) in the intensive care unit (ICU) and stepdown unit (SDU).Research methodology/designAn exploratory research was employed using a survey.SettingBedside participants were recruited via an electronic recruitment flyer circulated in online professional and social networking sites.Main outcome measuresItems consisted of a numeric rating scale, measuring competence and attitudes related to the management of patients with left ventricular assist devices. The one open-ended question asked the participants to write responses regarding challenges in left ventricular assist device care. Data were analysed using quantitative and qualitative analytics software.ResultsA total of 36 intensive care unit and 35 stepdown unit bedside nurse (n = 71) from six regions of the United States responded. Overall mean scores for competency and attitude domains were ≥ 7.0. Intensive care nurses scored higher in competence and attitude when compared to stepdown unit nurses care of short-term left ventricular assist devices. Competence and attitude were positively associated with years of experience. Five themes related to challenges in care were identified.ConclusionOverall, bedside nurses had satisfactory competence and attitudes surrounding the care of hospitalised left ventricular assist device patients.

T1  - Measuring Preferences and Behaviours in the 2019 Canadian Election Study
AN  - 2509183052
AB  - The 2019 Canadian Election Study (CES) consists of two separate surveys with campaign-period rolling cross-sections and post-election follow-ups. The parallel studies were conducted online and through a random-digit-dial (RDD) telephone survey. Both continue the long tradition of gathering information about the attitudes, opinions, preferences and behaviours of the Canadian public. The online survey, in particular, introduces some important innovations that open up the potential for exciting new research on subgroups in the electorate.

T1  - The time it takes to reveal embarrassing information in a mobile phone survey
AN  - 2495192749
AB  - To explore socially desirable responding in telephone surveys, this study examines response latencies in answers to 27 questions in a corpus of 319 audio-recorded voice interviews on iPhones. Response latencies were compared when respondents (a) answered questions on sensitive vs. nonsensitive topics (as classified by online raters); (b) produced more vs. less socially desirable answers; and (c) were interviewed by a professional interviewer or an automated system. Respondents answered questions on sensitive topics more quickly than on nonsensitive topics, though patterns varied by question format (categorical, numerical, ordinal). Independent of question sensitivity, respondents gave less socially desirable answers more quickly when answering categorical and ordinal questions but more slowly when answering numeric questions. Respondents were particularly quicker to answer sensitive questions when asked by interviewers than by the automated system. Findings demonstrate that response times can be (differently) revealing about question and response sensitivity in a telephone survey.

T1  - Using emojis in mobile web surveys for Millennials? A study in Spain and Mexico
AN  - 2486883703
AB  - To involve Millennials in survey participation, and obtain high-quality answers from them, survey designers may require new tools that better catch Millennials' interest and attention. One key new tool that could improve the communication and make the survey participation more attractive to young respondents are the emojis. We used data from a survey conducted among Millennials by the online fieldwork company Netquest in Spain and Mexico (n = 1614) to determine how emojis can be used in mobile web surveys, in particular in open-ended questions, and how their use can affect data quality, completion time, and survey evaluation. Overall, results show a high willingness of Millennials to use emojis in surveys (both stated and actual use) and a positive impact of encouraging Millennials to use emojis in open-ended questions on the amount of information conveyed, the completion time and the survey enjoyment.

T1  - Do Distractions During Web Survey Completion Affect Data Quality? Findings From a Laboratory Experiment
AN  - 2476108834
AB  - Web survey respondents are frequently distracted during survey completion, which potentially affects the quality of data they provide. This article reports on results from a laboratory experiment examining how distractions during web survey completion influence data quality. Participants were randomly assigned to experimental groups using a 2 (device type) × 3 (form of distraction) between-subject factorial design. They were asked to complete a web questionnaire on either a PC or a tablet and were allocated to one of the three distraction conditions: (1) the presence of other people in the room who have a loud conversation, (2) the presence of music, or (3) no distraction. The study examines the effect of distraction on various measures of data quality and attentiveness. While participants felt significantly more distracted in the presence of other people or music, the study found no significant effect of distraction for any of the data quality and attentiveness measures. The findings are encouraging for survey practitioners: Even if web respondents listen to music or are in noisy environments, these forms of distraction generally do not seem to affect the quality of responses they provide.

T1  - Telecommunication Regulatory Policy and the Effect of Institutions on Competition, Access, and Adoption of Broadband Internet Services in Mexico, 2013–2018
AN  - 2597512209
AB  - The central question of this study is whether the public and regulatory policy for the promotion of competition and digital inclusion of the Telecommunications Reform in Mexico (2013–2018) had a statistically significant effect on greater adoption of telecommunications services. In order to answer this question, the article analyzes the effects of the public and regulatory policy on promoting competition, which has been one of the main objectives of the Reform, due to its effects on prices, adoption, and in the quality of the services, in addition to offering greater legal certainty to the investment. It also examines the public policy of digital inclusion; the constitutional amendments that decreed access to broadband as a fundamental right of all Mexicans. This study also carries out an analysis using two econometric tools; the first consists of the fixed effects analysis and the second, of the synthetic control method, in which the case of Mexico is contrasted with that of other economies in Latin America with similar levels of development. The two econometric exercises consistently confirm that the institutional, regulatory, and digital inclusion policy changes associated with the Reform have not yet had a statistically significant effect on the adoption of telecommunications services. The gap is particularly evident in the case of mobile cellular services, in which Mexico shows an important lag. The social policy in telecommunications has not been able to reverse this trend of lag in the adoption. The findings on the limitations of this social coverage policy lead us to conclude that the government faces difficulties in offering an adequate response through a public policy of digital inclusion.

T1  - ICT infrastructure, innovation development and economic growth: a comparative evidence between two decades in OECD countries
TT  - ICT infrastructure, innovation, economic growth
AN  - 2533998157
AB  - PurposeThe objective of this study is to examine the causal relationship between economic growth, information and communication technology (ICT) penetration and innovation development in OECD countries.Design/methodology/approachThis study incorporates data for 24 OECD countries from 2000 to 2018, which is divided into the earliest (2000–2009) and the latest (2010–2018) periods. The econometric methodologies of this study employ panel cointegration, estimation procedures and vector error-correction modelling to investigate the potential interconnections between ICT, innovation development and economic growth.FindingsThe results from the latest period illustrate that OECD countries have achieved positive and significant economic development from high ICT penetration, while results from the earliest period show that OECD countries were just beginning to enjoy the benefits of ICT penetration. Moreover, findings show that innovation development is highly significant in the latest period when promoting economic growth.Practical implicationsThe policy implications suggest that promoting ICT infrastructure establishment and expanding the innovation development may drive the process of economic development in OECD countries.Originality/valueThis study employs mobile and Internet penetration as the development of telecommunication which is in line with the enlargement of innovation to foster economic growth in OECD countries. Comparing the evidence from two decades provides significant value for policymakers and decision-makers regarding the advantages of technology expansion and innovation development to promote economic growth in recent conditions.

T1  - Use of a research app in an online opt-in panel: The Netquest case
AN  - 2520759264
AB  - The increasing use of mobile devices in the frame of online surveys has been accompanied by the development of research apps. These research apps have the potential to facilitate the process for respondents (e.g. being able to complete surveys when Internet is not available provides more freedom on when and where participants can participate) and fieldwork companies (e.g. the possibility to use push notifications could lead to higher participation rates). However, previous research suggests that panelists may also be reluctant to install an app. In this study, we answer research questions related to the knowledge and use of the Netquest app. We found that a majority of panelist did not know about the app and although sending invitations significantly increased its installation, the overall total of respondents installing the app remained low. Furthermore, the profile of those who installed the app differs from those who did not. The participation of panelists after they installed the app seems stable. The main reason for installing the app is comfort while the main reason for not installing relates to space/battery usage. Most of those who did not install could accept to install the app.

T1  - Dancing with Data: Introducing a Creative Interactional Metaphor
AN  - 2464564806
AB  - In this article, a dance metaphor is developed to deepen our understanding of the material, sensual, processual, and experiential potential of digital data relations. Premised upon Blumer’s notion of a sensitising concept, ballroom dance theory is applied to everyday use of the Apple Watch so as to prompt investigation of subtle interactional features of device use. The aim is to engender an inclusive umbrella concept while simultaneously stimulating questions of analysis of and access to small-scale and intimate moments of embodied behaviours in future interactional analysis. In so doing, the article contributes to the sociology of data relationality in everyday life, as well as constituent approaches such as science and technology studies and the interactional study of bodies and machines.

T1  - The impact of digital technology development on sitting time across Europe
AN  - 2478256730
AB  - Digital technology development has been proposed to explain higher levels of sedentary behaviour; but this has not yet been confirmed. Thus, here we evaluated the impact of digital development on sedentary behaviour using two metrics: digital country development and e-devices ownership from the Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) and the Eurobarometer 88.4 cross-sectional survey with 28,031 participants ≥ 15 years old. From an environmental macro perspective, at the national level, a simple linear regression has been performed between the DESI and mean sitting time per country. To develop a micro approach to this phenomenon, binomial logistic regression models have been run among individual e-devices ownership and the daily amount of time spent sitting (≤3.5 h/day, > 4.5 h/day). Digital country development is positively related to sitting time, whereas the ownership of e-device (either DVD player, CD player, desk computer, laptop, and Internet connection) was associated with a higher sitting time (>4.5 h/day) in the overall population, with slight differences by gender. While further research is needed to understand the effect of digitalization on sedentary behaviour throughout time, here we document how it is associated with higher sitting time, as assessed through both macro and micro approaches.

T1  - Two Half-Truths Make a Whole? On Bias in Self-Reports and Tracking Data
AN  - 2435505547
AB  - The pervasive use of mobile information technologies brings new patterns of media usage, but also challenges to the measurement of media exposure. Researchers wishing to, for example, understand the nature of selective exposure on algorithmically driven platforms need to precisely attribute individuals’ exposure to specific content. Prior research has used tracking data to show that survey-based self-reports of media exposure are critically unreliable. So far, however, little effort has been invested into assessing the specific biases of tracking methods themselves. Using data from a multimethod study, we show that tracking data from mobile devices is linked to systematic distortions in self-report biases. Further inherent but unobservable sources of bias, along with potential solutions, are discussed.

T1  - Personality Research and Assessment in the Era of Machine Learning
AN  - 2457503961
AB  - The increasing availability of high‐dimensional, fine‐grained data about human behaviour, gathered from mobile sensing studies and in the form of digital footprints, is poised to drastically alter the way personality psychologists perform research and undertake personality assessment. These new kinds and quantities of data raise important questions about how to analyse the data and interpret the results appropriately. Machine learning models are well suited to these kinds of data, allowing researchers to model highly complex relationships and to evaluate the generalizability and robustness of their results using resampling methods. The correct usage of machine learning models requires specialized methodological training that considers issues specific to this type of modelling. Here, we first provide a brief overview of past studies using machine learning in personality psychology. Second, we illustrate the main challenges that researchers face when building, interpreting, and validating machine learning models. Third, we discuss the evaluation of personality scales, derived using machine learning methods. Fourth, we highlight some key issues that arise from the use of latent variables in the modelling process. We conclude with an outlook on the future role of machine learning models in personality research and assessment.

T1  - An Empirical Assessment of the Intrusiveness and Reasonableness of Emerging Work Surveillance Technologies in the Public Sector
AN  - 2446845004
AB  - As public sector work environments continue to embrace the digital governance revolution, questions of work surveillance practices and its relationship to performance management continue to evolve, but even more dramatically in the contemporary period of many public servants being forced to shift to remote work from home in response to the COVID‐19 pandemic. This article presents the results of three surveys, two of them population‐based survey experiments, all conducted during the onset of the COVID‐19 pandemic in Canada that compare public servant (n = 346) and citizen (n = 1,008 phone; n = 2,001 web) attitudes to various cutting‐edge—though no doubt controversial among some—digital surveillance tools that can be used in the public sector to monitor employee work patterns, often targeted toward remote working conditions. The findings represent data that can help governments and public service associations navigate difficult questions of reasonable privacy intrusions in an increasing digitally connected workforce.Evidence for PracticeNew work surveillance technologies are available to use within the public sector and will present acceptability challenges to public managers as they contemplate the introduction of these technologies.Multimodal survey data from Canada reveals that public servants and citizens find these emerging work surveillance technologies to be quite intrusive and unreasonable but show relatively more tolerance for digital surveillance over physical surveillance practices.Understanding surveillance anxieties among targeted employees will be key to finding a balance between employee privacy rights and employer desires to manage employees in a remote or digital environment.

T1  - Restricted Spatiality and the Inflation of Digital Space, an Urban Perspective
AN  - 2429413309
AB  - This article aims to explore whether or not digital space assumes the role of the spatial urban grid when movement of people is restricted under quarantine. The era of Web 2.0 and the increasingly easy access to mobile devices and the internet has created alternative virtual space for urban socio-spatial interactions. The article addresses these concepts in three parts. First, it adapts a theoretical framework that can address the emerging digital public and spatial restrictions. Second, it explores the possible inflation of digital space. Third, it questions the possibility of transfer of spatiality into virtual space. The finding shows significant inflation of digital space after quarantine, but no significant spatial characteristic can be identified among those interactions. The study emphasizes the importance of adapting existing theories for evolving urban challenges.

T1  - Web-based home-hazard modification app for falls prevention: the views of those at risk of falling and their carers
AN  - 2499024033
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of the study is to assess the usability and acceptability of FallCheck, a Web app that allows users to complete home-hazard assessments within their own home, with a group of people at risk of falling and their carers.Design/methodology/approachThis mixed method study used an online survey followed by semi-structured telephone interviews to collect both qualitative and quantitative data. A Think-Aloud study was used to test usability of the Web app through structured tasks.FindingsFindings showed that FallCheck was easy to use with few usability issues. The Web app was deemed appropriate to use by people at risk of falling (young or old) or by carers if appropriate. The depth of knowledge provision and breadth of content was acceptable, and many participants reported subsequently making changes to their home environment to reduce their risk of falling. Overall, the majority of participants reported feelings of improved confidence and safety with an increased awareness of fall risks and a reduction in fear of falling at home.Practical implicationsFallCheck has good acceptability and usability with people at risk of falling and their carers and has the potential to improve access to home-hazard assessment and affect behavioural change regarding fall risk hazards and behaviour.Originality/valueThis study describes successful use of an app that may be helpful in identifying home-hazards and making changes to reduce risk of falls, particularly in the absence of occupational therapy intervention and has the potential for integration into falls care pathways.

T1  - Reality bites: EU mobiles’ experiences of citizenship on the local level
AN  - 2430674622
AB  - With the introduction of EU citizenship a set of colliding and overlapping political frames and rights constellations has established new forms of mobility across EU member states. In this regard, respective scholarship has focused particularly on the reach and limits of EU citizenship status and rights. Yet, less attention has been paid to the question of how mobile EU citizens themselves experience these citizenship constellations when they settle into another EU member state. Addressing this question empirically, the article compares EU mobiles’ experiences in two European capital cities, Berlin and Copenhagen. It applies a mixed-method design drawing from data of an online questionnaire and, especially, semi-structured interviews with EU mobiles. A particular focus is put on EU mobiles’ ability to navigate local and national regulations through which EU citizenship is orchestrated. Their experiences shed light on how membership becomes situational and dependent on local and national regulations and contexts, while EU citizenship status and rights are considered less relevant. Against this background, the findings emphasise how bottom-up perspectives to citizenship complement more dominant perspectives in the literature which focus mainly on rights, legal status and political frameworks from the top down.

T1  - The role of online technologies and digital skills in the political participation of citizens with disabilities
AN  - 2417053256
AB  - Online technologies are viewed as a potential equalizer of opportunities for marginalized groups because they may help reduce inequality and oppression through their educational, social and professional capabilities. While many forms of political participation are increasingly mediatized by online technologies, very few studies have examined the extent to which citizens with disabilities use them to engage in democracy. This article addresses this challenge by examining how internet access for people with disabilities compares to others, whether people with disabilities are equally or more likely to use the internet to participate in politics, and the digital skills of users with disabilities. It draws on a phone survey conducted among a representative sample of the Canadian population. We find that Canadians with disabilities are less likely to access online technologies and that disabled users with low digital skills face additional barriers. However, disabled users whose knowledge allows them to make the most of the Internet are as likely – or even more likely – as non-disabled users to participate online in politics.

T1  - Discussing Extension Agents' Role in ModeratingContentious Issue Conversations
AN  - 2454195940
AB  - Extension agents are finding themselves engaged in problem-solving roles as public needs adjust to a climate where issues facing the agricultural and natural resource industry are more often contentious than benign. As connectors between the Land-grant university system and the public, Extension agents need to know how to effectively communicate about contentious issues with clientele. This study used an online survey design to determine Extension agents' attitudes toward contentious issues, challenges that they face,and effective means of communication. The findings revealed Extension agents' attitudes toward communicating about contentious issues were more positive than negative. Additionally, they found the availability of misinformation and the complexity of contentious issues to be most challenging when communicating with clientele. One-on-one in-person, workshops, phone calls, and group meetings were identified as the most effective methods of communicating about contentious issues. Additional training and familiarization with current contentious issues were recommended. Future research should examine the contentious issues Extension agents are discussing, methods being used to facilitate conversations, the effect of contentious issues on job satisfaction, and the factors hindering Extension agents as they address contentious issues.

T1  - Digital inclusion through mobile phones?: A comparison between mobile-only and computer users in internet access, skills and use
AN  - 2417798441
AB  - Given the rapid rise of mobile-only users, we investigated the digital inclusion process through smartphones. By using Chile as a case study, a country that has strongly promoted mobile connections to address internet access gaps, we compared mobile-only and computer users in different dimensions of the digital inclusion process, including digital skills and differentiated uses of the web. By relying on a face-to-face national representative survey, the results showed that smartphones represent an opportunity to access the internet for those who traditionally lag behind. However mobile-only use does not necessarily lead to a more complete digital inclusion process because it was related to lower levels of skills and less diverse types of uses of the web compared to those people who also use the computer. Also, skills partially mediated the association between access device and types of uses of the web, which suggests that the differences by access device partly occur because people have greater chances to develop skills when accessing the web through computers.

T1  - Mobile moratorium? The case of young people undertaking international internships
AN  - 2407556812
AB  - This article explores a significant yet curiously understudied form of transnational mobility as practiced by the highly qualified in Europe, namely the international internship. We argue that an international internship can be an ambivalent stage within youth transitions. While possibly providing a potential point of entry into a ‘dream’ career path, the economic and emotional costs of such undertakings also need to be accounted for, including an offsetting of professional stability and deferred rather than accelerated labour market entry. At the same time, international internships have the appearance of a response to a need for personal development and exploration. Taking on board these perspectives, we suggest that the international internship be considered a form of ‘mobile moratorium’, expanding on the possibilities associated with this conceptualisation. For young people in the European Union, this type of exchange also provides a means to engage in intra-European circulation while simultaneously pursuing personalized success. We investigate this proposition through analysis of data collected via an online survey, providing illustrations of what the international internship experience means for professional development and personal exploration.

T1  - Spot phone calls: A new method for measuring time use
AN  - 2438885846
AB  - Time-use research can provide important insights for different research questions. However, many time-use measures do not capture seasonal differences, qualitative dimensions of time use, and activities that are considered less ‘important’ or ‘desirable’. To address these issues, this article proposes spot phone calls as a new method for measuring time use. The spot phone calls methodology was piloted as part of a research project on time use of adults and children in northern Uganda. In different periods of the year, participants were called on their phones at different times of the day to be asked about their time use. The method was cost and time effective and made it possible to identify and understand seasonal differences in time use. It captured emotional and relational aspects of time use and accounted for activities that were undercounted in other measures, such as ‘doing nothing’ and men’s participation in unpaid care and domestic work. This article calls for the method to be tested with a larger sample.

T1  - Testing the Use of Voice Input in a Smartphone Web Survey
AN  - 2353475928
AB  - We implemented an experiment within a smartphone web survey to explore the feasibility of using voice input (VI) options. Based on device used, participants were randomly assigned to a treatment or control group. Respondents in the iPhone operating system (iOS) treatment group were asked to use the dictation button, in which the voice was translated automatically into text by the device. Respondents with Android devices were asked to use a VI button which recorded the voice and transmitted the audio file. Both control groups were asked to answer open-ended questions using standard text entry. We found that the use of VI still presents a number of challenges for respondents. Voice recording (Android) led to substantially higher nonresponse, whereas dictation (iOS) led to slightly higher nonresponse, relative to text input. However, completion time was significantly reduced using VI. Among those who provided an answer, when dictation was used, we found fewer valid answers and less information provided, whereas for voice recording, longer and more elaborated answers were obtained. Voice recording (Android) led to significantly lower survey evaluations, but not dictation (iOS).

T1  - Exploring digital evidence recognition among officers and troopers in a sample of a state police force
TT  - Exploring digital evidence recognition
AN  - 2533104556
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to examine the extent to which line officers in police agencies can identify digital evidence at crime scenes, also known as the binary artifacts stored on computers, mobile devices, tablets and the internet, through an analysis of survey responses of line staff in a Midwestern state police agency.Design/methodology/approachAn electronic survey was completed by 258 respondents using a scenario-based vignette asking them to identify where such evidence may be located during a fictitious call for service.FindingsMost all respondents identified appropriate devices and locations where digital evidence may be stored on suspects and victims in a scenario call for service. There were significant differences in responses on the basis of recent field experience with digital evidence.Research limitations/implicationsThe findings demonstrate the importance of experiential learning and training for line staff in police agencies to prepare them for basic digital evidence handling in the field. This sample is, however, based on a single state police agency and may not be reflective of other similarly sized agencies. Future research is needed to replicate this study and expand the generalizability of these findings.Originality/valueFirst responders should be able to identify and secure all appropriate forms of evidence at crime scenes, regardless of crime type, while awaiting specialized investigators. This study is one of the first to consider when and how police are able to recognize digital evidence at crime scenes.

T1  - Do Mobile Phones Help Expand Social Capital? An Empirical Case Study
AN  - 2511165577
AB  - The rapid adoption of mobile phones, particularly in developing countries, has led a number of researchers to investigate their impact on socioeconomic activity in the developing world. However, until the recent advent of smart communication devices, mobile phones were primarily a relations management technology that enabled people to stay connected with each other. In this article, we focus on this basic function and analyze how people use this technology as a tool to expand their social capital. We use a dataset containing more than three billion call detail records from Rwanda’s largest telecommunication operator, covering the whole country during the period from 1 July 2014 to 31 March 2015, and combine these records with data from the fourth Integrated Household Living Conditions Survey conducted by the National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda in 2015. We found that people’s calling patterns significantly correlated with the income level of their region, which also dictated the destinations of their calls, with middle-income regions acting as a link between the richest and the poorest regions. From these results, we propose a framework for understanding the role of mobile phones in the development of social capital.

T1  - Comparing Internet Experiences and Prosociality in Amazon Mechanical Turk and Population-Based Survey Samples
AN  - 2474445922
AB  - Given the high cost of traditional survey administration (postal mail, phone) and the limits of convenience samples such as university students, online samples offer a much welcomed alternative. Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) has been especially popular among academics for conducting surveys and experiments. Prior research has shown that AMT samples are not representative of the general population along some dimensions, but evidence suggests that these differences may not undermine the validity of AMT research. The authors revisit this comparison by analyzing responses to identical survey questions administered to both a U.S. national sample and AMT participants at the same time. The authors compare the two samples on sociodemographic factors, online experiences, and prosociality. The authors show that the two samples are different not just demographically but also regarding their online behaviors and standard survey measures of prosocial behaviors and attitudes. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for data collected on AMT.

T1  - MODERATED MEDIATION OF THE LINK BETWEEN LIVE STREAMING INFORMATION CONTENT AND IMPULSE PURCHASE: THE ROLE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTANCE AND STREAMER ADMIRATION
AN  - 2457275385
AB  - With the boom of mobile Internet and the popularization of smartphones, live streaming platforms have become an important marketing tool for online and physical stores. Based on signal theory and cognitive psychology, this paper discusses how the information content on live streaming platforms influences the impulse purchase of consumers, and how the influence is affected by psychological distance and streamer admiration of consumers. First, several hypotheses were put forward about the mediation role of psychological distance and the moderation role of streamer admiration. Then, the research data were collected through a questionnaire survey among the audience of live streaming platforms, and were analyzed through hierarchical regression to test the hypotheses. The results show that the information content of live streaming platforms has a significant positive impact on the impulse purchase of consumers; this impact is mediated by the psychological distance; the relationship between information content and psychological distance is moderated by streamer admiration. The research results provide new insights into the marketing effect of live streaming platforms and live streamers.

T1  - ICT Exposure and the Level of Wellbeing and Progress: A Cross Country Analysis
AN  - 2267588289
AB  - Innovations of information and communication technologies (ICTs) have influenced human life through time-saving, diffusion of knowledge, easy communication, and networks, access to information and automation with artificial intelligence. They not only increase productivity, cut-down hardship, improve transparency and governance, build social capital and empower individuals but also raise risks of cyber threats and insecurity of private life, displace labours, encourage sedentary life-style and digitally divide individuals in the society etc. These together do not seem to have unambiguous impacted on the aggregate wellbeing and progress (WPI) of a nation, and thus this paper empirically examined their resultant relationship at the aggregate level. An index of WPI has been prepared to account for the aggregate level of satisfaction derived from six sources, namely economic, human, progress, cultural, environmental wellbeing and happiness. Similarly, an index of ICT exposure has been constructed by combining access to mobile, internet and telephone connections, and internet security. Using a panel database for 67 countries representing all subcontinents during 2000–2014, we find that ICT exposure positively improves the aggregate level of WPI. The net impact is marginally lower in less-developed and developing countries (e.g., Africa, Asia, and the Middle East) than the rest (e.g., Europe and North America).

T1  - Hidden constraints to digital financial inclusion: the oral-literate divide
AN  - 2312064554
AB  - The vision that digital finance can achieve universal financial inclusion is premised on the rarely questioned assumption that the world is rapidly moving towards universal literacy and numeracy. In fact, text and arithmetic notation shape the relationship between formal finance and about a billion of the world's poorest adults. This "oral" population, stranded outside the reach of formal employment, have neither the capabilities nor the incentives to engage in digital finance as it is currently being offered. Empirical observation of the actual capabilities and incentives of oral adults can offer transformative solutions for mobile wallet providers, NGO projects, designers and governments.

AB  - Qualitative inquiry always used various kinds of data for understanding social issues and participants’ perspectives. Research and methodologies were debated for what data are adequate for studying social justice issues. Current challenges for concepts of data are new, for example, virtual and digital data, question traditional data (interviews, ethnography, etc.) in their relevance for understanding current life worlds. New methods produce new and other forms of data (e.g., mobile, virtual data). Neoliberal contexts produce questions about qualitative research and its data. What is an adequate and contemporary understanding of the concept of “data”? These questions are discussed in this special issue.

T1  - Answering Mobile Surveys With Images: An Exploration Using a Computer Vision API
AN  - 2281055268
AB  - Most mobile devices nowadays have a camera. Besides, posting and sharing images have been found as one of the most frequent and engaging Internet activities. However, to our knowledge, no research has explored the feasibility of asking respondents of online surveys to upload images to answer survey questions. The main goal of this article is to investigate the viability of asking respondents of an online opt-in panel to upload during a mobile web survey: First, a photo taken in the moment, and second, an image already saved on their smartphone. In addition, we want to test to what extent the Google Vision application programming interface (API), which can label images into categories, produces similar tags than a human coder. Overall, results from a survey conducted among millennials in Spain and Mexico (N = 1,614) show that more than half of the respondents uploaded an image. Of those, 77.3% and 83.4%, respectively, complied with what the question asked. Moreover, respectively, 52.4% and 65.0% of the images were similarly codified by the Google Vision API and the human coder. In addition, the API codified 1,818 images in less than 5 min, whereas the human coder spent nearly 35 hours to complete the same task.

T1  - Coincidence by design
AN  - 2272706696
AB  - In this article we develop an approach to coincidences as discursive activities. To illustrate the range of empirical questions that can be explored in the analysis of coincidence accounts, we examine one single written account, which was submitted to a website of a research project to investigate the statistical dimensions of coincidence experiences. Our analysis is broadly ethnomethodological in that we examine this single case to identify how structural and narrative components work to constitute the recognizably coincidental quality of the events so described. The analysis identifies a mirror structure that resembles chiasmus, a figurative device found in classical texts. The analysis also describes how the account is designed to address inferential matters related to the site to which it was submitted. In the discussion we reflect on the implications of this approach for other approaches to coincidence.

T1  - An APPetite for APPs: A Comparison of Heavily Reliant and Light Reliant App Users on Political Activity and Media Reliance
AN  - 2256065516
AB  - The ubiquity of mobile devices and the apps that power them has spurred concerns that they are contributing to the decline in news media use. Mobile devices, however, have been credited with spurring political participation. In its examination of app-reliant individuals, this study found that reliance on apps positively predicts political participation, and respondents who rely heavily on mobile apps for political information are more politically active than light app users on six of the seven measures of nononline participation and three of the six measures of online political activity. Heavy-reliant users also rely more heavily on all six online-only media tested than light app users and rely more heavily on broadcast television news, CNN, and news magazines. Data were collected from October 31, 2016, through November 2, 2016, from 644 respondents of a national online panel.

T1  - SurveyMotion: what can we learn from sensor data about respondents' completion and response behavior in mobile web surveys?
AN  - 2220295195
AB  - Participation in web surveys via smartphones increased continuously in recent years. The reasons for this increase are a growing proportion of smartphone owners and an increase in mobile Internet access. However, research has shown that smartphone respondents are frequently distracted and/or multitasking, which might affect completion and response behavior in a negative way. We propose 'SurveyMotion (SMotion)', a JavaScript-based tool for mobile devices that can gather information about respondents' motions during web survey completion by using sensor data. Specifically, we collect data about the total acceleration (TA) of smartphones. We conducted a lab experiment and varied the form of survey completion (e.g. standing or walking). Furthermore, we employed questions with different response formats (e.g. radio buttons and sliders) and measured response times. The results reveal that SMotion detects higher TAs of smartphones for respondents with comparatively higher motion levels. In addition, respondents' motion level affects response times and the quality of responses given. The SMotion tool promotes the exploration of how respondents complete mobile web surveys and could be employed to understand how future mobile web surveys are completed.

T1  - Types of cannabis and tobacco/nicotine co-use and associated outcomes in young adulthood
AN  - 2254482028
AB  - Cannabis and tobacco/nicotine use are highly comorbid. Given expanding access to cannabis through legalization for recreational use, it is important to understand how patterns of cannabis and tobacco/nicotine co-use are associated with young adult outcomes. A predominantly California-based sample of 2,429 young adults (mean age = 20.7) completed an online survey. Based on past-year reports of cannabis and tobacco/nicotine use, we defined 5 mutually exclusive groups: (a) single-product use; (b) concurrent use only (using both products, but only on separate occasions); (c) sequential use only (using both products on the same occasion, one right after the other, but not mixing them together); (d) coadministration only (using both products on the same occasion by mixing them in the same delivery device); and (e) both sequential use and coadministration. We examined group differences in use patterns, dependence, consequences of use, and psychosocial functioning. Fifty percent of respondents reported cannabis use, 43% tobacco/nicotine use, and 37% co-use of both substances. The most prevalent method of co-use involved smoking combustible products. Overall, individuals who co-used both substances on the same occasion in some way reported heavier use and greater problematic behaviors than those who did not. Sequential use (especially among those that also engaged in coadministration) was typically associated with worse physical and mental functioning overall compared to using each substance separately. Findings illuminate both prevalence and risks associated with co-use of cannabis and tobacco/nicotine products and can inform policies for states considering regulation of cannabis and tobacco/nicotine products.

T1  - Does Increasing Mobile Device Coverage Reduce Heterogeneity in Completing Web Surveys on Smartphones?
AN  - 2223777728
AB  - Mobile coverage recently has reached an all-time high, and in most countries, high-speed Internet connections are widely available. Due to technological development, smartphones and tablets have become increasingly popular. Accordingly, we have observed an increasing use of mobile devices to complete web surveys and, hence, survey methodologists have shifted their attention to the challenges that stem from this development. The present study investigated whether the growing use of smartphones has decreased how systematically this choice of device varies between groups of respondents (i.e., how selective smartphone usage for completing web surveys is). We collected a data set of 18,520 respondents from 18 web surveys that were fielded in Germany between 2012 and 2016. Based on these data, we show that while the use of smartphones to complete web surveys has considerably increased over time, selectivity with respect to using this device has remained stable.

T1  - What Is the Best Size for Matrix-Style Questions in Online Surveys?
AN  - 2223777492
AB  - Across two studies, we aimed to determine the row and column size in matrix-style questions that best optimizes participant experience and data quality for computer and mobile users. In Study 1 (N = 2,492), respondents completed 20 questions (comprising four short scales) presented in a matrix grid (converted to item-by-item format on mobile phones). We varied the number of rows (5, 10, or 20) and columns (3, 5, or 7) of the matrix on each page. Outcomes included both data quality (straightlining, item skip rate, and internal reliability of scales) and survey experience measures (dropout rate, rating of survey experience, and completion time). Results for row size revealed dropout rate and reported survey difficulty increased as row size increased. For column size, seven columns increased the completion time of the survey, while three columns produced lower scale reliability. There was no interaction between row and column size. The best overall size tested was a 5 × 5 matrix. In Study 2 (N = 2,570), we tested whether the effects of row size replicated when using a single 20-item scale that crossed page breaks and found that participant survey ratings were still best in the five-row condition. These results suggest that having around five rows or potentially fewer per page, and around five columns for answer options, gives the optimal survey experience, with equal or better data quality, when using matrix-style questions in an online survey. These recommendations will help researchers gain the benefits of using matrices in their surveys with the least downsides of the format.

AN  - 2196500543
AB  - This article explores the comparability of assessment tools under different format conditions. Prior studies have not considered the interaction of format and device on time to complete an assessment and have instead treated each of them separately with conflicting results. This study assesses, by linear regressions using web-based data, the performance of multiple devices under varying formats while controlling for non-device factors such as demographic information. The results of this study add to the growing literature on the equivalence among devices and formats used to collect and interpret performance in a variety of organizational settings.

T1  - Measurement Reliability, Validity, and Quality of Slider Versus Radio Button Scales in an Online Probability-Based Panel in Norway
AN  - 2162930603
AB  - Little is known about the reliability and validity in web surveys, although this is crucial information to evaluate how accurate the results might be and/or to correct for measurement errors. In particular, there are few studies based on probability-based samples for web surveys, looking at web-specific response scales and considering the impact of having smartphone respondents. In this article, we start filling these gaps by estimating the measurement quality of sliders compared to radio button scales controlling for the device respondents used. We conducted therefore two multitrait–multimethod (MTMM) experiments in the Norwegian Citizen Panel (NCP), a probability-based online panel. Overall, we find that if smartphone respondents represent a nonnegligible part of the whole sample, offering the response options in form of a slider or a radio button scale leads to a quite similar measurement quality. This means that sliders could be used more often without harming the data quality. Besides, if there are no smartphone respondents, we find that sliders can also be used, but that the marker should be placed initially in the middle rather than on the left side. However, in practice, there is no need to shift from radio buttons to sliders since the quality is not highly improved by providing sliders.

T1  - Struggle for Equality: From the Constitutional Revolution to Cyberfeminism with a Focus on the Role of New Media in the Women’s Movement in Iran
TT  - Kampf um die Gleichberechtigung von der konstitutionellen Revolution zum Cyberfeminismus mit dem Fokus auf die Rolle der neuen Medien in der Frauenbewegung im Iran
AN  - 2375495296
AB  - This study focuses on two inter-related questions: What effect did new media have on the Iranian women’s movement; and what impact did the women’s movement have on the Green Movement. Emergence and significance of new social communication technologies on struggles for social equality. Development of the women's movement in Iran during 100-year politically historically significant period from Constitutional Revolution 1905, world and regional wars to contemporary cyberfeminism, with focus on new media in a critical decade of the women’s movement (2003–2013) and related Green Movement of 2009. During the Iranian women’s movement 100-year history Iranian women contributed actively to major political transitions including the Constitutional Revolution 1905 and Revolution of 1979. Yet efforts to secure equal rights achieved less success. The study examines four decades post-1979 revolution. The first two decades the women’s movement struggled to be heard. The third decade from 1999 the movement gained momentum. Internet, mobile phones and new media created opportunities to organize, build support abroad and mobilize large exile communities. Beginning 2006 worldwide Internet and global communication raised hopes for new effectiveness. The study analyses new media usage by women and civil activists in Iran, impacts, consequences on the women’s movement and interactions with the political Green Movement and related 2009 presidential campaign. The study is structured in 10 chapters: Chapter 1 overview. Chapter 2 social political history of women's movement in Iran struggle for rights. Chapter 3 women’s movement impacts, political approaches, new media, Internet, micro-macro interactions. Chapter 4 pragmatic women's rights and social activists’ use of new media. Chapter 5 social context, political change, resistance. Chapter 6 new media as agent for diversity and pluralism. Chapter 7 Internet as double-edged sword, social political gains, government responses, technological controls. Chapter 8 regional impact in the Middle East. Chapter 9 scientific methods, primary research data, statistical analysis. Chapter 10 conclusions. Primary data includes qualitative interviews with 18 experts in Iran and abroad, including women’s and civil rights activists, journalists, lawyers, political activists, artists, authors and students, regarding new media in the women’s movement in Iran. An online questionnaire with 278 respondents adds empirical quantitative data. Statistical analysis supports findings that the women’s movement shaped the presidential election of 2009 in at least two ways: “policy influence” and “transformational dialogue.” Women’s rights activists evolved use of new media to promote pluralistic voicing of demands in public platforms, to open dialogues for discussion and to promote civil society “tolerance approaches” in contrast to constrained political status quo, factional interests and extremism.

T1  - The Effect of Device and Mode on Measurement in Telephone and Web Surveys
AN  - 2299173380
AB  - The use of mobile communication has expanded rapidly over the past decade. More than fifty percent of US adults now live in a cell phone only household (Blumberg and Luke, 2017), and close to 60% use their phones to access the internet (Pew Research Center, 2017). Survey researchers and respondents have adapted to this change, and many telephone surveys achieve at least 70% of completes from a cellular frame (Langer, 2015, Pew, 2017, Gallup, 2016), and up to 40% of completes on web surveys are from mobile devices (Saunders, 2015; McGeeney, 2015; Lugtig, Toepoel and Amin, 2016; Marlar 2018). This dramatic shift to mobile devices has raised concerns among survey researchers about the potential impact on measurement (Lavrakas et al., 2010; Kennedy and Everett, 2011; Peytchev and Hill, 2010; Buskirk, 2011; Buskirk and Andrus, 2012; Antoun et al., 2018). 
This dissertation builds upon previous research on mode differences to understand how mobile devices impact measurement, either within a mode or across modes. I explore three main research objectives: (1) do telephone survey responses and data quality differ across cellular and landline respondents, (2) do web survey responses and data quality differ across mobile device and computer respondents, and (3) do we still find measurement mode differences between telephone and web responses when mobile devices are included in comparisons?
	Overall, I find little evidence that respondents answer questions differently on mobile and traditional devices, controlling for demographics. Mean scores, probability of giving a most positive or negative response, and measures of data quality were similar between landline and cellular respondents and desktop and mobile respondents. Scale design had no meaningful impact on measurement differences between devices. 
	Consistent with earlier work on measurement mode differences, telephone respondents give significantly more positive responses to attitudinal questions than web respondents (Dillman, 1991; Dillman et al. 1996; de Leeuw, 2005; Dillman and Christian, 2005; Brick and Lepkowski, 2008; Christian, Dillman, and Smyth, 2008). My research provides evidence that previous finding on mode differences hold with the inclusion of mobile devices. Further, there was not a scale format that effectively minimized differences between modes.

T1  - Social Movements and Civic Rights in Eastern Europe
AN  - 2226727308
AB  - Revue des Sciences Politiques, launched in April 2019, expands the research area of the journal by focusing on the analysis and monitoring of the challenges of democracy and by refining the social and institutional cleavages in the area of: - human rights monitoring in Central and Eastern Europe (Elena Todorova, Human Rights in Central and Eastern European Countries: Towards Their Accession to the European Union); - pan-European constituency and the third wave of the electoral reform in the European Union (Jakub Charvát, Pan-European Constituency and Transnational Lists: The Third Wave of the EU Politics of Electoral Reform?); - the conceptualization of the Romanian semi-presidentialism and its "formative moment" (Loretta C. Salajan, The Challenges and Formative Moment of Romanian Semi-Presidentialism); - the analysis of the interviews with public fugures of Yugoslav media space in 1989-1990 (Marijana Ražnjević Zdrilić, Interviews with Public Figures of Yugoslav Media Space in 1989/1990 in Croatian Local Newspapers); - the discourse of freedom and its impact on English learning and teaching after the fall of the Romanian communist dictatorship (Eleonora Olivia Bălănescu, The Fall of Communism and Its Impact on English Teaching and Learning); - the societal and educational cleavages (Ecaterina Sarah Frăsineanu, The Beginning of Studies and the Prediction of University Abandonment); - the causes and effects of the faillure of the socialist movement in modern Romania (Florin Nacu, Why Did the Socialist Movement Fail in Modern Romania?); - the post-modern image production in post-communism (Simber Atay, PostSoviet Era and Postmodern Image Production); - social movements and offline mobilization (Adina-Loredana Dogaru-Tulică, A bridge between online and offline mobilization: #RezistMovement).

Furthermore, we appreciate that the Eastern European landscape needs additional tools for its reasearch and investigation.

[...]being the first issue of this year, issue 61 points a transitional phase for the journal by enabling comparative researches on human rights protection and promotion in Central and Eastern European countries and by focusing on cross-country variations in the field of social and political reforms.

[...]the RSP Editors wish to remind all readers that the analysis of the complexity of social movements and civic rights monitoring serves to emphasize the transitional changes in Eastern Europe launching new research questions and perspectives.

T1  - International jurisdiction for violations of personality rights on the internet: Bolagsupplysningen
AN  - 2164125994
AB  - The European Court of Justice (ECJ) rules on international jurisdiction for violations of personality rights on the Internet. In recent decades, the Internet has changed the balance of powers in defamation cases fundamentally. Whereas during the 20th century, only professional publishers, such as the press, TV and radio stations, had the means lo widely spread information to a large audience, so that the victim of defamatory publications was usually confronted with a far more powerful opponent, nowadays, everyone can profit from various digital dissemination channels. The worldwide accessibility of online content, an ordinary person may reach an international audience just by using a smart phone and, thus, also cause considerable harm in many countries. Furthermore, not only natural persons, but also companies may become victims, like in the present case. This development challenges the existing rules on international jurisdiction and poses new questions.

T1  - Measuring GDP in the digital economy: Increasing dependence on uncaptured GDP
AN  - 2161639546
AB  - As revealed by Tapscott in his best-seller The Digital Economy published in 1994, the Internet has dramatically changed the way of conducting business and our daily lives. Further advancement of digital innovation, including cloud, mobile services, and artificial intelligence, has augmented this change significantly and provided us with extraordinary services and welfare never anticipated before. However, contrary to such an accomplishment, productivity in industrialized countries now confronts an apparent decline raising the question of a possible productivity paradox in the digital economy. The limitations of gross domestic product (GDP) statistics in measuring the advancement of the digital economy have become an important subject. While this mismatch is an old problem rooted in the dynamics of product innovations, since mismatch brought about by information and communication technology (ICT) is very strong, finding a solution to this critical issue has become highly crucial in the digital economy. Based on an intensive review of preceding studies and empirical analyses of national, industrial and individual behaviors in the digital economy, this paper attempted to draw a perspective on this critical issue. By means of an analysis of co-evolution among a shift in people's preferences from economic functionality to supra-functionality beyond economic value, the advancement of ICT and paradigm change to uncaptured GDP, a solution to this critical issue was investigated. New insights for measuring the digital economy were explored which provide insight into integration of national accounts with product-oriented micro-analysis efforts.

T1  - Grid and Item-by-Item Formats in PC and Mobile Web Surveys
AN  - 2133338570
AB  - While grids or matrix questions are a widely used format in PC web surveys, there is no agreement on the format in mobile web surveys. We conducted a two-wave experiment in an opt in panel in Russia, varying the question format (grid format and item-by-item format) and device respondents used for survey completion (smartphone and PC). The 1,678 respondents completed the survey in the assigned conditions in the first wave and 1,079 in the second wave. Overall, we found somewhat higher measurement error in the grid format in both mobile and PC web conditions. We found almost no significant effect of the question format on test–retest correlations between the latent scores in two waves and no differences in breakoff rates between the question formats. The multigroup comparison showed some measurement equivalence between the question formats. However, the difference varied depending on the length of a scale with a longer scale producing some differences in the measurement equivalence between the conditions. The levels of straightlining were higher in the grid than in the item-by-item format. In addition, concurrent validity was lower in the grid format in both PC and mobile web conditions. Finally, subjective indicators of respondent burden showed that the grid format increased reported technical difficulties and decreased subjective evaluation of the survey.

T1  - Item-by-item Versus Matrix Questions
AN  - 2133338486
AB  - While the choice of matrix versus item-by-item questions has received considerable attention in the literature, it is still unclear in what situation one is better than the other. Building upon the previous findings, this study expands this line of research by examining whether the difference between the two question types is moderated by the number of response options. Through a web survey experiment, this study compares matrix and item-by-item questions with 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, and 11 response options. Additionally, we also investigate the impact of the device used to complete the survey on data quality. The results show that straight lining and response time are similar between the two question types across all response lengths, but item nonresponse tends to be higher for matrix than item-by-item question, especially among mobile respondents. Also measurement models reveal measurement equivalence between the two question types when there are fewer than seven response options. For matrices with 9 or 11 response options, analyses reveal substantial differences compared to item-by-item questions.

T1  - Automatic Versus Manual Forwarding in Web Surveys
AN  - 2133338436
AB  - Several authors and software vendors advocate the benefits of auto forwarding in web surveys, but there is little empirical research on this approach. We experimentally tested automatic versus manual forwarding (MF) under different levels of cognitive effort. We manipulated information accessibility (IA; low vs. high) and consistency requirements (CRs; yes vs. no), along with auto forwarding (AF) versus MF in two studies conducted among students in Finland. We find that an AF survey takes less time to complete, but only for those completing a survey on personal computers or tablets; no time advantage is found for smartphone users. We also find that respondents in both AF and MF conditions return more often to items with higher cognitive burden (low IA or a CR). MF respondents change answers more often than AF respondents. AF appears to reduce straightlining slightly. We find no difference in response consistency between two behavioral items between AF and MF, but a slight advantage for AF for two attitude items. Finally, respondents reported more positive experiences with the AF version. Auto forwarding appears to be somewhat more efficient and easy to use but may decrease the quality of responses to cognitively demanding questions.

T1  - Testing different rank order question layouts for PC and smartphone respondents
AN  - 2113030466
AB  - We studied the impact of different layouts for rank order questions on respondent effort, data quality, and substantive results among PC and smartphone respondents, in an experiment in an opt-in online panel in Spain, using an order-by-click design. We experimentally varied the device, the number of columns, and, for smartphone respondents, the position of the 'next' button in questions on trust in institutions.We found some evidence of lower data quality for smartphone users but no evidence that presenting ranking items in one column performs differently than two columns. We also find little evidence that these effects differ by the number of response options presented or the number to be ranked. The placement of the 'next' button had little effect on performance on ranking items. Overall, our findings suggest that the format and layout of order-by-click questions has little effect on data quality, regardless of device used.

T1  - "That's what I'm talking about": Twitter as a promotional tool for political journalists
AN  - 2153866096
AB  - In the last decade, journalists have adapted to technological innovations that facilitate the creation of an individual identity online and personal connections with audiences. In parallel, the rise of hypercompetition in the media industry raises questions about the increasing importance of market considerations. Under these conditions, journalists gradually develop promotional practices online. This article examines the scope of these promotional practices among political journalists on Twitter through a content analysis of messages posted by members of the Press Gallery of the Quebec National Assembly. It also analyzes motivations and norms related to these practices through a series of interviews with Press Gallery members. The findings indicate that promotion is an important feature of the production of Quebec parliamentary press on Twitter. The quest for visibility, competition, and the requests made by management teams in a context of economic hardship are key motivations for using Twitter as a promotional device.

T1  - Web Surveys by Smartphones and Tablets
AN  - 2103387628
AB  - Does completing a web survey on a smartphone or tablet computer reduce the quality of the data obtained compared to completing the survey on a laptop computer? This is an important question, since a growing proportion of web surveys are done on smartphones and tablets. Several earlier studies have attempted to gauge the effects of the switch from personal computers to mobile devices on data quality. We carried out a field experiment in eight counties around the United States that compared responses obtained by smartphones, tablets, and laptop computers. We examined a range of data quality measures including completion times, rates of missing data, straightlining, and the reliability and validity of scale responses. A unique feature of our study design is that it minimized selection effects; we provided the randomly determined device on which respondents completed the survey after they agreed to take part. As a result, respondents may have been using a device (e.g., a smartphone) for the first time. However, like many of the prior studies examining mobile devices, we find few effects of the type of device on data quality.

T1  - Design Heuristics for Effective Smartphone Questionnaires
AN  - 2103387450
AB  - Design principles for survey questionnaires viewed on desktop and laptop computers are increasingly being seen as inadequate for the design of questionnaires viewed on smartphones. Insights gained from empirical research can help those conducting mobile surveys to improve their questionnaires. This article reports on a systematic literature review of research presented or published between 2007 and 2016 that evaluated the effect of smartphone questionnaire design features on indicators of response quality. The evidence suggests that survey designers should make efforts to “optimize” their questionnaires to make them easier to complete on smartphones, fit question content to the width of smartphone screens to prevent horizontal scrolling, and choose simpler types of questions (single-choice questions, multiple-choice questions, text-entry boxes) over more complicated types of questions (large grids, drop boxes, slider questions). Based on these results, we identify design heuristics, or general principles, for creating effective smartphone questionnaires. We distinguish between five of them: readability, ease of selection, visibility across the page, simplicity of design elements, and predictability across devices. They provide an initial framework by which to evaluate smartphone questionnaires, though empirical testing and further refinement of the heuristics is necessary.

AN  - 2539301238
AB  - Seit Anfang der 2000er Jahre hat die rasante Verbreitung von Kameras durch Mobiltelefone, Überwachungskameras und Body Cameras zu einem starken Anstieg von Videoaufnahmen menschlicher Interaktionen geführt. Über Webseiten, die auf Nutzer*innen-generierten Inhalten aufbauen (z.B. YouTube) sowie Live-Streaming-Seiten (z.B. GeoCam) wird der Zugang zu solchem Videomaterial enorm erleichtert und ist heute für Forschende nur einen Mausklick entfernt. Während die Nutzung dieser Datenbestände großes Potenzial für die sozialwissenschaftliche Forschung verspricht, wirft sie auch forschungsethische Fragen auf, die existierende Richtlinien und Veröffentlichungen bislang nur teilweise beantworten können. In unserem Artikel beziehen wir bestehende forschungsethische Prinzipien und Überlegungen auf die Forschung mit Online-Videodaten. Wir diskutieren fünf Bereiche, die für die Nutzung von Online-Videodaten aus forschungsethischer Sicht besonders relevant sind bzw. in denen solche Forschung besondere Potenziale verspricht: die informierte Einwilligung, Analysemöglichkeiten, Privatsphäre, Transparenz und die Vermeidung von Schaden. Wir zeigen auf, wie diese Bereiche zusammenhängen und wie Forschende sowie Leser*innen von Studien mit Online-Videodaten diese in forschungsethischer Hinsicht bewerten können. Wir hoffen, mit diesem Artikel zu einer informierten und transparenteren Diskussion zum Thema Forschungsethik im Bereich der Forschung mit Online-Videodaten beitragen zu können.Alternate abstract:Since the early 2000s, the proliferation of cameras in devices such as mobile phones, closed-circuit television (CCTV), or body cameras has led to a sharp increase in video recordings of human interaction and behavior. Through websites that employ user-generated content (e.g., YouTube) and live streaming sites (e.g., GeoCam), access to such videos virtually is at the fingertips of social science researchers. Online video data offer great potential for social science research to study an array of human interaction and behavior, but they also raise ethical questions to which existing guidelines and publications only provide partial answers. In our article we address this gap, drawing on existing ethical discussions and applying them to the use of online video data. We examine five areas in which online video research raises specific questions or promises unique potentials: informed consent, analytic opportunities, privacy, transparency, and minimizing harm to participants. We discuss their interplay and how these areas can inform practitioners, reviewers, and interested readers of online video studies when evaluating the ethical standing of a study. With this study, we contribute to an informed and transparent discussion about ethics in online video research.

T1  - Comparing Grids With Vertical and Horizontal Item-by-Item Formats for PCs and Smartphones
AN  - 2036738420
AB  - Much research has been done comparing grids and item-by-item formats. However, the results are mixed, and more research is needed especially when a significant proportion of respondents answer using smartphones. In this study, we implemented an experiment with seven groups (n = 1,476), varying the device used (PC or smartphone), the presentation of the questions (grids, item-by-item vertical, item-by-item horizontal), and, in the case of smartphones only, the visibility of the “next” button (always visible or only visible at the end of the page, after scrolling down). The survey was conducted by the Netquest online fieldwork company in Spain in 2016. We examined several outcomes for three sets of questions, which are related to respondent behavior (completion time, lost focus, answer changes, and screen orientation) and data quality (item missing data, nonsubstantive responses, instructional manipulation check failure, and nondifferentiation). The most striking difference found is for the placement of the next button in the smartphone item-by-item conditions: When the button is always visible, item missing data are substantially higher.

T1  - To what extent are members of an online panel willing to share different data types? A conjoint experiment
AN  - 2313779973
AB  - Recently, the idea of ‘data fusion’, that is, of combining different types of data, became quite popular because of the advances of new technologies. In particular, several studies started investigating the possibility of combining survey data with other data types in order to get a more complete or accurate picture of the reality and/or to reduce survey burden. One key element, then, is the willingness of people to share different types of data, beyond survey answers. In this article, we investigate to what extent members from an opt-in online panel in Spain are willing to share different types of information that have in general not been studied before in the literature: records of their surrounding sound (audiotracking), information from their email inbox (in different ways, sharing the email credentials, using an email plug-in or redirecting emails, partially or totally), sensorial reactions measured by a wearable device (neuroscience) and public information about them available online. We use a choice-based conjoint analysis in order to study the level of willingness depending on the incentives offered in exchange, and we present the level of willingness by gender and age groups. Overall, we find huge differences in the level of willingness across data types. Increasing the incentives, on the contrary, does not improve the willingness so much, even if there is a positive trend. Some differences are observed across gender and age groups but most of them are not statistically significant.

T1  - Assessing the Electoral Impact of the 2010 Oregon Citizens’ Initiative Review
AN  - 2021151314
AB  - The Oregon Citizens’ Initiative Review (CIR) distinguishes itself by linking a small deliberative body to the larger electoral process. Since 2010, CIR citizen panels have been a legislatively authorized part of Oregon general elections to promote a more informed electorate. The CIR gathers a representative cross-section of two dozen voters for 5 days of deliberation on a single ballot measure. The process culminates in the citizen panelists writing a Citizens’ Statement that the secretary of state inserts into the official Voters’ Pamphlet sent to each registered voter. This study analyzes the effect of one such Citizens’ Statement from the 2010 general election. In Study 1, an online survey experiment found that reading this Statement influenced Oregon voters’ values trade-offs, issue knowledge, and vote intentions. In Study 2, regression analysis of a cross-sectional phone survey found a parallel association between the Statement’s use and voting choices but yielded some mixed findings.

T1  - Mobile and Dirty
AN  - 2014115559
AB  - In this article, we present a study on the data quality and the response process of mobile online surveys using an experimental design as compared to a standard computer. We used the following indicators to measure data quality and response properties: reaction time to survey invitation, break-off rate, item nonresponse, length of responses to open-ended questions and survey transmission, processing, and completion time. With regard to completion time, we also explored the significance of the place as well as the situation in which the survey was completed, the kind of Internet connection the respondents had as well as the hardware properties of the devices used to answer the online survey. Our results suggest comparable data quality and response properties in most aspects: There were no noticeable differences between computer and mobile users as regards break-off rate, item nonresponse, and length of responses to open-ended questions, nor the place where the survey was completed. However, it took respondents in the mobile group longer to complete the survey as compared to respondents answering the online survey on their computer. In terms of the completion time, there was a significant decrease in the differences between mobile devices and PCs when respondents used technically advanced mobile devices and had access to a fast Internet connection.

T1  - Investigating recruitment and completion mode biases in online and door to door electronic surveys
AN  - 2008961943
AB  - Electronically assisted survey techniques offer several advantages over traditional survey techniques. However, they can also potentially introduce biases, such as coverage biases and measurement error. The current study compares the relative merits of two survey distribution and completion modes: email recruitment with internet completion; and door to door recruitment with either tablet or internet completion. Presentation mode is held constant so that we are able to separate the impacts of recruitment mode and completion mode on responses. Recruitment mode appeared to influence both response rates and which socio-demographic groups were represented. However, the difference between the two recruitment modes was relatively small. Completion mode appeared to have little or no impact on responses although it did influence completion times. The email distributed survey performed better with regard to time costs and the number of respondents obtained. Differences between the two survey modes appeared to be largely due to recruitment method rather than completion mode.

T1  - When digital natives instruct digital immigrants: active guidance of parental media use by children and conflict in the family
AN  - 1964148758
AB  - Based on the premise that children are active agents who influence their parents' media use, this study investigated child-parent digital media guidance. Children often introduce new media into the family and influence parents' media adoption and use. This study also investigated whether this child-parent digital media guidance is associated with media conflicts in the family. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 187 parent-child dyads in Flanders, Belgium. Paired samples t-tests and multiple linear regression analyses were conducted. The results showed that both children and parents reported that children guide their parents how to use digital media, especially for newer media forms such as smartphones, tablets, and apps. Families where there was more child-parent digital media guidance reported more conflicts about media. These relationships were comparable in the parent and child reports.

T1  - A New Tool for Assessing Mobile Device Proficiency in Older Adults: The Mobile Device Proficiency Questionnaire
AN  - 1987797818
AB  - Mobile device proficiency is increasingly required to participate in society. Unfortunately, there still exists a digital divide between younger and older adults, especially with respect to mobile devices (i.e., tablet computers and smartphones). Training is an important goal to ensure that older adults can reap the benefits of these devices. However, efficient/effective training depends on the ability to gauge current proficiency levels. We developed a new scale to accurately assess the mobile device proficiency of older adults: the Mobile Device Proficiency Questionnaire (MDPQ). We present and validate the MDPQ and a short 16-question version of the MDPQ (MDPQ-16). The MDPQ, its subscales, and the MDPQ-16 were found to be highly reliable and valid measures of mobile device proficiency in a large sample. We conclude that the MDPQ and MDPQ-16 may serve as useful tools for facilitating mobile device training of older adults and measuring mobile device proficiency for research purposes.

T1  - Telephone versus Online Survey Modes for Election Studies: Comparing Canadian Public Opinion and Vote Choice in the 2015 Federal Election
AN  - 2021688739
AB  - Election studies must optimize on sample size, cost and data quality. The 2015 Canadian Election Study was the first CES to employ a full mixed-mode design, aiming to take advantage of the opportunities of each mode while preserving enough commonality to compare them. This paper examines the phone interviews conducted by ISR-York and the online questionnaires from panellists purchased from a sample provider. We compare data quality and representativeness. We conduct a comprehensive comparison of the distributions of responses across modes and a comparative analysis of inferences about voting. We find that the cost/power advantages of the online mode will likely make it the mode of choice for subsequent election studies.

T1  - Web Versus Mobile Web: An Experimental Study of Device Effects and Self-Selection Effects
AN  - 1967170796
AB  - Due to a rising mobile device penetration, Web surveys are increasingly accessed and completed on smartphones or tablets instead of desktop computers or laptops. Mobile Web surveys are also gaining popularity as an alternative self-administered data collection mode among survey researchers. We conducted a methodological experiment among iPhone owners and compared the participation and response behavior of three groups of respondents: iPhone owners who started and completed our survey on a desktop or laptop PC, iPhone owners who self-selected to complete the survey on an iPhone, and iPhone owners who started on a PC but were requested to switch to iPhone. We found that respondents who completed the survey on a PC were more likely to be male, to have a lower educational level, and to have more experience with Web surveys than mobile Web respondents, regardless of whether they used the iPhone voluntarily or were asked to switch from a PC to an iPhone. Overall, iPhone respondents had more missing data and took longer to complete the survey than respondents who answered the questions on a PC, but they also showed less straightlining behavior. There are only minimal device differences on survey answers obtained from PCs and iPhones.

T1  - The Design of Field Experiments With Survey Outcomes: A Framework for Selecting More Efficient, Robust, and Ethical Designs
AN  - 1961949153
AB  - There is increasing interest in experiments where outcomes are measured by surveys and treatments are delivered by a separate mechanism in the real world, such as by mailers, door-to-door canvasses, phone calls, or online ads. However, common designs for such experiments are often prohibitively expensive, vulnerable to bias, and raise ethical concerns. We show how four methodological practices currently uncommon in such experiments have previously undocumented complementarities that can dramatically relax these constraints when at least two are used in combination: (1) online surveys recruited from a defined sampling frame (2) with at least one baseline wave prior to treatment (3) with multiple items combined into an index to measure outcomes and, (4) when possible, a placebo control. We provide a general and extensible framework that allows researchers to determine the most efficient mix of these practices in diverse applications. Two studies then examine how these practices perform empirically. First, we examine the representativeness of online panel respondents recruited from a defined sampling frame and find that their representativeness compares favorably to phone panel respondents. Second, an original experiment successfully implements all four practices in the context of a door-to-door canvassing experiment. We conclude discussing potential extensions.

T1  - The golden handcuffs? Choice, compliance and relocation amongst transnational professionals and executives
AN  - 1943735924
AB  - People who routinely cross borders for their jobs are often cast as beneficiaries of globalisation. But in a world of economic downturns, un- or underemployment as well as political unrest access to an increasingly global market becomes the personal and organisational solution to a host of unwanted happenings. In these circumstances, it therefore becomes less clear whether the heightened mobility of transnational workers is a benefit or indeed a choice. This article examines the onus placed on employees to be geographically mobile for their jobs. Relocation enables organisations to operate in expanding transnational markets and fields; it is therefore a prerequisite of jobs in an increasing number of sectors. Through systematic comparison of the attitudes to mobility of highly skilled employees in a 'market' (corporate) and a 'moral' (UN) case-study organisation, this article makes a contribution to our understanding of work orientations in transnational institutions. It interrogates the myth of choice of highly skilled movers and identifies the aspirations, contradictions and dilemmas that are associated with relocating for their jobs. Analysis of biographical interviews in tandem with online survey data elucidates the complex ways that the competing repertoires of choice and compliance are woven into transnational narratives.

T1  - The mobile Internet and digital citizenship in African-American and Latino communities
AN  - 1914571038
AB  - Smartphone use is transforming the meaning of being online, especially for African-Americans and Latinos. To what extent has this enabled these populations to become digital citizens, able to participate in society online? Internet use is increasingly important for the exercise of the political, economic and social rights that have often been associated with citizenship [Mossberger, K., Tolbert, C. J., & McNeal, R. S. (2008). Digital citizenship: The Internet, society, and participation. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press], and can be measured by the political and economic activities that individuals engage in online. Using unique survey data from a diverse city, we use multilevel analysis and interactions to examine relationships between forms of access and activities online in 2013, controlling for neighborhood context as well as individual characteristics. In contrast with prior work, we find that while broadband access is most strongly associated with political and economic activities online, that mobile is as well. The effects are strongest for African-Americans and Latinos, especially for Latinos who live in heavily Latino neighborhoods - who have lagged behind furthest in Internet use.

T1  - Are There Differences Depending on the Device Used to Complete a Web Survey (PC or Smartphone) for Order-by-click Questions?
AN  - 1919385394
AB  - The development of web surveys has been accompanied by the emergence of new scales, taking advantages of the visual and interactive features provided by the Internet like drop-down menus, sliders, drag-and-drop, or order-by-click scales. This article focuses on the order-by-click scales, studying the comparability of the data obtained for this scale when answered through PCs versus smartphones. I used data from an experiment where panelists from the Netquest opt-in panel in Spain were randomly assigned to a PC, smartphone optimized, or smartphone not-optimized version of the same questionnaire in two waves. I found significant differences due to the device and optimization at least for some indicators and questions.

T1  - Assessing personality using emoji: An exploratory study
AN  - 2057009285
AB  - The increasing popularity of text-based computer mediated communication, such as instant messaging and mobile texting, have resulted in the emergence of a new pictographic form of language, i.e. emoji, offering an intuitive and informal way to convey emotions and attitudes, replacing words or phrases in text messages. Based on these characteristics, could identification with emoji be associated with personality? Could they be used instead of text-based items in personality assessment? The present study aimed at exploring these questions. The sample is composed of 234 young adults recruited online (age: M = 24.79, SD = 6.47; 62% female). Participants responded to a brief Big-Five personality questionnaire and a 91-item survey assessing participants' degree of self-identification with emoji selected from the Apple Color Emoji fontset. Results indicated that 36 out of 91 examined emoji are significantly related with three of the Big-Five personality traits - emotional stability, extraversion, and agreeableness - that are consistently linked with emotion and affective processing. Emoji-based measures of these personality traits show moderate-to-large concurrent validity with scores from a validated personality questionnaire (r = 0.6–0.8). Overall, our study advances the idea that emoji might be employed to develop a language-free assessment tool for personality.

T1  - Easing Political Digestion: The Effects of News Curation on Citizens' Behavior
AN  - 1941405788
AB  - We focus on "curated news:" a collection of links delivered to one's inbox, phone, or RSS feed. These digests vary in the extent to which they contextualize the information they present. Some offer headlines with links to the full article, while others summarize and interpret the story for the reader. Using a survey experiment, we vary the amount of contextualization present in a set of curated links. We find that increased curation decreases the likelihood that individuals will seek out the original source of political information, but it does lead people to recall more information about the issues being discussed.

T1  - How Many Congregations Are There? Updating a Survey-Based Estimate
AN  - 1932768710
AB  - Researchers have attempted to estimate the number of congregations in the United States using counts provided by denominations, existing media (newspapers, phone books, websites, etc.), and calculations using congregational surveys. Hadaway and Marler (2005) took the third approach, basing their estimate on the 1998 National Congregations Study (NCS), a representative sample of U.S. congregations, and select official denominational statistics. Since publishing their estimate of 331,000 congregations in 1998, two subsequent waves of the NCS have been conducted. Using the same approach, I estimate the number of congregations in 1998, 2006, and 2012. I conclude that congregations probably became more numerous, likely due to growth among nondenominational Protestants and the extraordinarily low death rate of congregations. But I also consider alternative interpretations of the data.

T1  - 'I'll just text you': Is face-to-face social contact declining in a mediated world?
AN  - 1910297774
AB  - The rise in the network society might lead to a decline in face-to-face contact as people substitute it with more mediated forms, or an increase in both face-to-face and mediated contact as complements, with unknown consequences for social support. This article examines trends in social contact, mediated contact (phone, online, etc.), and social support in 2002, 2006 and 2010, using aggregated ABS General Social Survey data. Results show an aggregate decline in face-to-face contact and rise in mediated contact in Australia between 2002 and 2010, but no aggregate decline in perceived social support, and a strong positive individual-level association between both forms of contact and social support. There are, however, signs of an emerging class-based digital divide, with low-income older men and less educated respondents reporting lower levels of mediated contact and social support by 2010.

AB  - The number of respondents who access web surveys on a mobile device (smartphone or tablet) has been increasing rapidly over the last few years. Compared with desktop computers, mobile devices have smaller screens, different input options, and are used in a larger variety of locations and situations. The suspicion that the quality of data may suffer when online respondents use mobile devices has stimulated a growing body of research, which has mainly focused on paradata and web survey design. To investigate whether the respondents' device affects the quality of web survey data, we examined the responses of 1,826 mobile-device and desktop participants in a political online survey that asked questions about the 2013 German federal election. To determine the reliability and validity of data submitted via mobile devices, we determined the consistency of the participants' responses across questions and validated the responses against various internal and external criteria. Replicating previous findings, mobile-device respondents were younger and more likely to be female, and they produced higher dropout rates and longer completion times than desktop respondents. However, data produced by respondents using mobile devices were as consistent, reliable, and valid as data produced by respondents using desktop computers. These findings contradict the notion that mobile-device users compromise the reliability and validity of data collected online and suggest that researchers do not necessarily need to be afraid of the participation of mobile-device respondents in web surveys.

T1  - Why Do Web Surveys Take Longer on Smartphones?
AN  - 1902319689
AB  - Surveys completed on mobile web devices (smartphones) have been found to take longer than surveys completed on a PC. This has been found both in surveys where respondents can choose which device they use and in surveys where respondents are randomly assigned to devices. A number of potential explanations have been offered for these findings, including (1) slower transmission over cellular or Wi-Fi networks, (2) the difficulty of reading questions and selecting responses on a small device, and (3) the increased mobility of mobile web users who have more distractions while answering web surveys. In a secondary analysis of student surveys, we find that only about one-fifth of the time difference can be accounted for by transmission time (between-page time) with the balance being within-page time differences. Using multilevel models, we explore possible page-level (question-level) and respondent-level factors that may contribute to the time difference. We find that much of the time difference can be accounted for by the additional scrolling required on mobile devices, especially for grid questions.

T1  - Energy drink use frequency among an international sample of people who use drugs: Associations with other substance use and well-being
AN  - 1927205854
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study aims were to identify: i.) energy drink (ED), caffeine tablet, and caffeine intranasal spray use amongst a sample who report drug use, and ii.) the association between ED use frequency and demographic profile, drug use, hazardous drinking, and wellbeing. METHOD: Participants (n=74,864) who reported drug use completed the online 2014 Global Drug Survey. They provided data on demographics, ED use, and alcohol and drug use, completed the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and Personal Wellbeing Index (PWI), and reported whether they wished to reduce alcohol use. RESULTS: Lifetime ED, caffeine tablet and intranasal caffeine spray use were reported by 69.2%, 24.5% and 4.9%. Median age of ED initiation was 16 years. For those aged 16-37, median years using EDs increased from 4 to 17 years of consumption, where it declined thereafter. Greater ED use frequency was associated with: being male; under 21 years of age; studying; and past year caffeine tablet/intranasal spray, tobacco, cannabis, amphetamine, MDMA, and cocaine use. Past year, infrequent (1-4days) and frequent (=5days) past month ED consumers reported higher AUDIT scores and lower PWI scores than lifetime abstainers; past month consumers were less likely to report a desire to reduce alcohol use. CONCLUSIONS: ED use is part of a complex interplay of drug use, alcohol problems, and poorer personal wellbeing, and ED use frequency may be a flag for current/future problems. Prospective research is required exploring where ED use fits within the trajectory of other alcohol and drug use.

T1  - Design and the digital Bible: persuasive technology and religious reading
AN  - 1886294313
AB  - This article analyses two 'digital Bibles', products that allow the user to engage with the Bible through the screen and speakers of his/her mobile phone, tablet or computer. Both products, 'YouVersion' and 'GloBible', have been created by Evangelical Christian companies. I argue that both are designed to train the user in traditional Evangelical Christian understandings of the work of reading. Digital media offer new opportunities to guide and influence the user, and this article applies the concepts of 'persuasive technologies' and 'procedural rhetoric' to analyse the design intentions of the two digital Bibles. This approach helps us to appreciate the significance of the material form of a sacred text as a vehicle for religious socialisation and raises important questions about the potential for digital media to re-shape traditional relationships of power in Evangelical Christian communities.

T1  - Mode Matters: Evaluating Response Comparability in a Mixed-Mode Survey
AN  - 1951135148
AB  - This paper examines the effects of survey mode on patterns of survey response, paying special attention to the conditions under which mode effects are more or less consequential. We use the Youth Participatory Politics survey, a study administered either online or over the phone to 2920 young people. Our results provide consistent evidence of mode effects. The internet sample exhibits higher rates of item non-response and "no opinion" responses, and considerably lower levels of differentiation in the use of rating scales. These differences remain even after accounting for how respondents selected into the mode of survey administration. We demonstrate the substantive implications of mode effects in the context of items measuring political knowledge and racial attitudes. We conclude by discussing the implications of our results for comparing data obtained from surveys conducted with different modes, and for the design and analysis of multi-mode surveys.

T1  - Harnessing GPS Data for the Future of Electric Cars in Europe
AN  - 1869336511
AB  - The first successful electric automobile in the U.S. debuted in 1891. Over the last century, the development of electric vehicles (EVs) has been intimately tied to the oil market; in recent years, growing environmental concerns have ushered in a new era of EVs. If all light-duty vehicles in the U.S. were replaced by EVs, carbon pollution from transportation would decline by as much as 20 percent.However, many questions need to be answered before embarking on such a daunting task. For instance, to what extent can EVs satisfy the transportation needs in the current market where gasoline vehicles still take up 99% of its share? How can automobile manufactures and city planners efficiently establish the charging infrastructure for EVs? The answers lie in big data.

T1  - Terrorist Use of the Internet by the Numbers
AN  - 1915237551
AB  - Research Summary 
Public interest and policy debates surrounding the role of the Internet in terrorist activities is increasing. Criminology has said very little on the matter. By using a unique data set of 223 convicted United Kingdom-based terrorists, this article focuses on how they used the Internet in the commission of their crimes. As most samples of terrorist offenders vary in terms of capabilities (lone-actor vs. group offenders) and criminal sophistication (improvised explosive devices vs. stabbings), we tested whether the affordances they sought from the Internet significantly differed. The results suggest that extreme-right-wing individuals, those who planned an attack (as opposed to merely providing material support), conducted a lethal attack, committed an improvised explosive device (IED) attack, committed an armed assault, acted within a cell, attempted to recruit others, and engaged in nonvirtual network activities and nonvirtual place interactions were significantly more likely to learn online compared with those who did not engage in these behaviors. Those undertaking unarmed assaults were significantly less likely to display online learning. The results also suggested that extreme-right-wing individuals who perpetrated an IED attack, associated with a wider network, attempted to recruit others, and engaged in nonvirtual network activities and nonvirtual place interactions were significantly more likely to communicate online with co-ideologues. 
Policy Implications 
Collectively the results provide insight into violent radicalization as a whole and not just into violent online radicalization. The results also largely confirm the results found in von Behr, Reding, Edwards, and Gribbon (2013) and in Gill and Corner (2015). The current study and the two previous studies have tackled these questions by using numerous methodological approaches and data sources and have arrived at similar conclusions. The Internet is largely a facilitative tool that affords greater opportunities for violent radicalization and attack planning. Nevertheless, radicalization and attack planning are not dependent on the Internet, and policy needs to look at behavior, intentions, and capabilities and not just at beliefs. From a risk assessment perspective, the study also highlights the fact that there is no easy offline versus online violent radicalization dichotomy to be drawn. It may be a false dichotomy. Plotters regularly engage in activities in both domains. Often their behaviors are compartmentalized across these two domains. Threat management policies would do well to understand the individuals' breadth of interactions rather than relying on a dichotomous understanding of offline versus online, which represent two extremes of a spectrum that regularly provide prototypical examples in reality. A preoccupation with only checking online behaviors may lead an intelligence analyst to miss crucial face-to-face components of a plot's technical development or a perpetrator's motivation. Policy and practice may benefit from adopting insights from emerging research arguing in favor of disaggregating our conception of the "terrorist" into discrete groups (e.g., foreign fighters vs. homegrown fighters, bomb-makers vs. bomb-planters, and group-actors vs. lone-actors; Gill and Corner, 2013; LaFree, 2013) rather than disaggregating the radicalization process into discrete groups (e.g., online radicalization and prison radicalization). We need to understand the drives, needs, and forms of behavior that led to the radicalization and attack planning and why the offender chose that environment rather than purely looking at the affordances the environment produced. By looking at the Internet as an affordance opportunity that some forms of terrorist or terrorist violence require more than others do, the focus is shifted from the radicalization process toward an understanding of how crimes are committed. In other words, we are looking at crime events rather than at the underlying dispositions behind the criminality.

Policy and practice may benefit from adopting insights from emerging research arguing in favor of disaggregating our conception of the "terrorist" into discrete groups (e.g., foreign fighters vs. homegrown fighters, bomb-makers vs. bomb-planters, and group-actors vs. lone-actors; Gill and Corner, 2013; LaFree, 2013) rather than disaggregating the radicalization process into discrete groups (e.g., online radicalization and prison radicalization). We need to understand the drives, needs, and forms of behavior that led to the radicalization and attack planning and why the offender chose that environment rather than purely looking at the affordances the environment produced. By looking at the Internet as an affordance opportunity that some forms of terrorist or terrorist violence require more than others do, the focus is shifted from the radicalization process toward an understanding of how crimes are committed. In other words, we are looking at crime events rather than at the underlying dispositions behind the criminality.

T1  - The role of smartphones in increasing digital and social inequalities among Romanian children
AN  - 1884370696
AB  - The emergence of new mobile devices such as Smartphones and tablets in children's everyday life has facilitated the rise of Internet private use among them, making it possible for them to go online at anytime and anywhere. As studies show, ownership and private use of a Smartphone shape the quality of children's online experience in a meaningful way (Mascheroni & Cuman, 2014). Accordingly, a broader range of access locations and devices relates to more unsupervised access and thus more independent use of the Internet, which are likely to be related to higher skill levels. This paper aims to investigate, using linear and multilinear regressions, whether owning or having access to Smartphones leads to increasing digital inequalities among children. Results show that demographic variables are significant predictors for the level of Smartphone related skills. However, when variables related with children's Smartphone and Internet use are introduced in the model, the influence of demographic variables is reduced, showing evidence for second-level of digital divide among children. The present study reports on the Net Children Go Mobile dataset. The project collected data in 2013 from random stratified survey samples of around 500 children aged 9-16, who are Internet users, in seven European country, including Romania. For the purpose of this paper, only responses from Romanian children were taken into account (N=522).

T1  - Tempted to Text: College Students' Mobile Phone Use During a Face-to-Face Interaction With a Close Friend
AN  - 1841791808
AB  - We examined whether emerging adults would engage in mobile phone use (MPU) when given the opportunity to socialize face-to-face with a close friend in a laboratory setting. Sixty-three U.S. college student friendship dyads rated their friendship quality in an online survey before coming into the laboratory together. When they arrived for their appointment, they were asked to wait together in a room for 5 min. A hidden camera recorded each dyad. Friends then separately rated the quality of the interaction. We coded time spent using mobile phone in seconds. A hierarchical regression conducted at the level of the dyad controlling for friendship quality and gender showed that more MPU was associated with lower quality interactions. We discuss findings in terms of the potential for MPU to interfere with the development of friendship intimacy.

T1  - Open narrative questions in PC and smartphones: is the device playing a role?
AN  - 1827074964
AB  - Most survey questions are closed questions, where respondents have to select an answer from a proposed set of alternatives. However, a lot of surveys also include, at least occasionally, some open questions. Open questions that call for elaborated and developed answers, called "open narrative questions", are used when the researchers want to go deeper into what the respondents think. This paper compares the answers to open narrative questions when the respondent is participating in a PC survey, in a smartphone-not-optimised survey or in a smartphone-optimised survey. The experiment was carried out in Spain using data collected by the Netquest online access panel. Respondents were assigned randomly to each type of device and survey format, in two successive waves. Because respondents have to type in their answer, we expect differences between devices, linked with the size and the kind of keyboards (i.e. physical versus digital, touch-screen or not). Differences are observed between answers that come from PCs and smartphones for the response time per written character, for the number of total characters and for the use of abbreviations, but not for the non-answer and non-substantive responses. No differences are observed between optimised and not optimised versions for smartphones, except for the response time per character written.

T1  - The Role of Online Communication in Long-Term Cyberbullying Involvement Among Girls and Boys
AN  - 1876552341
AB  - Digital media, especially mobile communication technologies, enable adolescents to explore and experiment with each other with only limited adult control. Conflicts between peers can be easily staged since nearly everybody can be reached at any time under the radar of authorities. Therefore, involvement in conflicts and bullying might depend on how adolescents use and behave online. In the present study, we provide a comprehensive picture of the role aspects of online communication play in long-term involvement in cyberbullying. We focused on a gender-specific perspective, as girls and boys were found to differ not only according to their online communication but also in their cyberbullying involvement. Using a two-wave panel survey of 1817 adolescents between 13 and 17 years (56 % female), we found that girls' cyberbullying involvement (perpetration and victimization) could be traced back to more intensive online social activities and a higher amount of online contact with strangers. In contrast, for boys, only higher exposure to antisocial media content predicted higher levels of victimization over time. The findings indicate that certain patterns of online communication increase the cyberbullying risk over time. However, it needs to be noted that these risk factors vary between girls and boys.

T1  - Atmosphere: Context, detachment, and the view from above Earth
AN  - 1819909671
AB  - Since the 1950s, views of Earth from above have been critiqued for provoking detachment from and decontextualization of human, terrestrial concerns. These critiques thus establish Earth's enveloping atmosphere as the ultimate context for meaningful and grounded accounts of humanness, and outer space as a site for abstract, generalizable knowledge. But in outer space, the explanatory work done by "context" is put in question, because spacefaring humans must attend to basic and constantly shifting conditions for life that lie beyond "context" on Earth, including breathing. Attention to humans in real and speculative space environments reveals context as a naturalizing device that establishes universal nature/culture distinctions through recourse to grounding terrestrial ontologies.

T1  - Public Sector Reform and Racial Occupational Mobility
AN  - 1804836545
AB  - Whether the public sector continues to offer African Americans an upwardly mobile "occupational niche" is unclear, especially in the face of contemporary reforms that run counter to workplace protections. In this article, and drawing on overtime data from Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we explore this question with a specific focus on the upward mobility of men into white-collar occupations. Findings suggest that the reform period of 2005-2010, characterized by increased employer discretion and an application of a "business model" to public sector work, undermined African American relative to White promotion prospects. What was once greater racial parity in the incidence, determinants, and timing of upward mobility during the pre-reform period (1985-1990) eroded during the reform period (2005-2010). Promotion-centered inequalities in the private sector, in contrast, while high, were more or less constant across the same time period. We conclude by discussing escalating public sector racial disadvantages, the processes undergirding them, and their implications for the likely contraction of the African American middle class.

T1  - Young Children's Tablet Use and Associations with Maternal Well-Being
AN  - 1801826002
AB  - While recent research has documented a rapid increase in the use of new technologies such as touchscreen tablets early in life, little is known about how young children use tablets, what activities they engage in, and whether family demographic and maternal well-being are associated with early use. Guided by Bronfenbrenner's bioecological theory of human development, the current study addressed these questions with a cross-sectional, online survey of mothers with children between 12 and 48 months of age. Mothers reported on their child's tablet use as well as their own personal well-being (depressive symptoms and role overload) and relational well-being (relationship satisfaction, coparenting quality, conflict frequency). Nearly 63 % of all mothers owned a tablet. Approximately 46 % of children with access typically use a tablet in an average day, with the majority using for 15 min or less. For families who owned a tablet, child's frequency of use was positively associated with child's age and mother's use and negatively associated with mother's relational well-being. Despite the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation that screen media be avoided for children under 24 months, children in our study used tablets, albeit infrequently. Our findings suggest that it is important for researchers to consider the relationship between contextual factors within the family and child media use. Refining their focus for families with particular needs may allow child advocates and policy makers to develop more beneficial media recommendations for families with a variety of circumstances.

T1  - Breaking Out of the Lab: Measuring Real-Time Responses to Televised Political Content in Real-World Settings
AN  - 1795915639
AB  - Real-time response (RTR) measurement is an important technique for analyzing human processing of electronic media stimuli. Although it has been demonstrated that RTR data are reliable and internally valid, some argue that they lack external validity. The reason for this is that RTR measurement is restricted to a laboratory environment due to its technical requirements. This paper introduces a smartphone app that 1) captures real-time responses using the dial technique and 2) provides a solution for one of the most important problems in RTR measurement, the (automatic) synchronization of RTR data. In addition, it explores the reliability and validity of mobile RTR measurement by comparing the realtime reactions of two samples of young and well-educated voters to the 2013 German televised debate. Whereas the first sample participated in a classical laboratory study, the second sample was equipped with our mobile RTR system and watched the debate at home. Results indicate that the mobile RTR system yields similar results to the lab-based RTR measurement, providing evidence that laboratory studies using RTR are externally valid. In particular, the argument that the artificial reception situation creates artificial results has to be questioned. In addition, we conclude that RTR measurement outside the lab is possible. Hence, mobile RTR opens the door for large-scale studies to better understand the processing and impact of electronic media content. [web URL: http://poq.oxfordjournals.org/content/80/2/542.abstract]

T1  - Built to lie: Investigating technologies of deception, surveillance, and control
AN  - 1793315112
AB  - This article explores technological systems that dissimulate by design. Examples include untrustworthy hotel and workplace thermostats, digital applications to spy on workers and family members, and commercial and law-enforcement systems that surreptitiously collect mobile phone data. Rather than view such cases as exceptional, I argue that deceptive communication systems are hidden articulations of normal technological orders. If deception in itself is not the primary problem with such systems, then transparency alone cannot be the solution. As troubling as institutional opacity might be, an analysis of deceptive systems reveals more fundamental problems: imbalances in power and widespread acquiescence to corporate and state efforts to control individuals, groups, and their data. By moving beyond a quest for (or belief in) technological veracity, scholars could redirect attention to power inequalities and the pressing question of how to live together ethically.

T1  - Dismantling the public airwaves: Shifting Canadian public broadcasting to an online service: International Journal for Mass Communication studies
AN  - 1796785101
AB  - In 2014, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation released a five-year plan entitled A Space For Us All. The plan outlined a bold new vision for the Canadian public broadcaster, placing digital mobile content at the forefront of the corporation's priorities. This article examines the shifting priorities of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation against established principles of public broadcasting. It also interrogates the relationship between mobile digital media and legal obligations of the public broadcaster under current Canadian broadcasting regulation. Drawing upon Canadian broadcasting history, contemporary data and recent examples from sport and politics in Canada, the article questions this new direction for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and argues that despite the significant new opportunities in mobile digital media, traditional broadcasting methods remain the dominant tool to reach mass audiences and will provide a significant forum for public information and debate for the foreseeable future.

T1  - Development and validation of the Internet Skills Scale (ISS)
AN  - 1774840828
AB  - Although a number of instruments have been used to measure Internet skills in nationally representative surveys, there are several challenges with the measures available: incompleteness and over-simplification, conceptual ambiguity, and the use of self-reports. Here, we aim to overcome these challenges by developing a set of reliable measures for use in research, practice, and policy evaluations based on a strong conceptual framework. To achieve this goal, we carried out a literature review of skills-related studies to develop the initial Internet skills framework and associated instrument. After the development of this instrument, we used a three-fold approach to test the validity and reliability of the latent skill constructs and the corresponding items. The first step consisted of cognitive interviews held in both the UK and the Netherlands. Based on the cognitive interview results, we made several amendments to the proposed skill items to improve clarity. The second step consisted of a pilot survey of digital skills, both in the UK and in the Netherlands. During the final step, we examined the consistency of the five Internet skill scales and their characteristics when measured in a representative sample survey of Dutch Internet users. The result is a theoretical, empirically and cross-nationally consistent instrument consisting of five types of Internet skills: operational, navigation information, social, creative, and mobile.

T1  - Improving nurse-patient communication with patients with communication impairments: hospital nurses' views on the feasibility of using mobile communication technologies: ANR
AN  - 1792211740
AB  - Nurses communicating with patients who are unable to speak often lack access to tools and technologies to support communication. Although mobile communication technologies are ubiquitous, it is not known whether their use to support communication is feasible on a busy hospital ward. The aim of this study was to determine the views of hospital nurses on the feasibility of using mobile communication technologies to support nurse-patient communication with individuals who have communication impairments. This study involved an online survey followed by a focus group, with findings analyzed across the two data sources. Nurses expected that mobile communication devices could benefit patient care but lacked access to these devices, encountered policies against use, and held concerns over privacy and confidentiality. The use of mobile communication technologies with patients who have communication difficulties is feasible and may lead to improvements in communication and care, provided environmental barriers are removed and facilitators enhanced.

T1  - Grouping of Items in Mobile Web Questionnaires
AN  - 1790890207
AB  - There is some evidence that a scrolling design may reduce breakoffs in mobile web surveys compared to a paging design, but there is little empirical evidence to guide the choice of the optimal number of items per page. We investigate the effect of the number of items presented on a page on data quality in two types of questionnaires: with or without user-controlled skips. Three versions of a 30-item instrument were compared, with 5, 15, or all 30 questions presented on a page, in two different surveys, one with skips and one without. We found that displaying 30 items on a page reduced the breakoff rate by almost one-third compared to presenting five items per page in the questionnaire without skips, but the difference was not statistically significant. In both surveys with and without skips, the completion times were significantly lower in the 30-item per page condition; however, item nonresponse rates were also higher. We give some practical recommendations to guide choices while designing questionnaires for mobile web surveys.

T1  - Family functioning, social support, and quality of life for patients with anxiety disorder
AN  - 1761494407
AB  - Few studies have examined the relationship between family functioning, social support and quality of life in patients with anxiety disorder. There is a paucity of research on anxiety disorders and their predictors in China. This study aimed to explore family functioning, social support and quality of life for patients with anxiety disorder and examine the relationship between these elements. A total of 107 patients who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; DSM-IV) criteria for anxiety disorder and 80 healthy controls completed the McMaster Family Assessment Device, the Perceived Social Support Scale and the short form of the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire. The findings indicate that patients with anxiety disorder in China tend to have poor family functioning and quality of life, as well as a higher subjective perception of social support. There were strong correlations between family functioning, social support and quality of life. Affective involvement and not living with parents were identified as risk factors for anxiety disorders, while a high family income was a protective factor. Anxiety disorder is associated with reduced family functioning and poorer quality of life for Chinese patients. In addition, the Family Assessment Device is a suitable instrument for evaluating family functioning in Chinese patients with anxiety disorder.

T1  - When information becomes action: How information communication technologies affect collective action during crises
AN  - 1872338615
AB  - Over the last 10 years, the dramatic increase in access to information communications technologies (ICTs) in developing countries has spurred popular efforts to use them for crisis response and violence prevention. As access to mobile phones and the internet has expanded, a key question remains: Do people actually use these tools for participation in governance processes? The results from my case studies and survey data strongly indicate that they do not. Even among groups we expect to be technologically savvy, for example the young, urban and/or wealthy, patterns of information gathering during crisis are still oriented toward traditional broadcast media and elite messaging. Instead, the evidence from my case studies and surveys indicate that people make decisions about the validity and actionability of information during crises based on complex social and political factors that are tangentially related to technology access.   This dissertation contributes deeper theorization of the role of ICTs in crisis response, drawing on the political science and sociology literature on collective action and violence prevention. This social-theoretical grounding is important because while technologists and engineers have pushed for innovative use of ICTs in crisis response and international development more widely, there remains limited understanding of how these technologies, and the information shared across them, are used by communities to support socio-political processes, including violence prevention and disaster response. To make my theoretical argument I frame crises and crisis response as a collective action problem; communities who are trying to have a peaceful election or manage limited resources after a natural disaster have to keep people engaged in the collective process of maintaining stability. What ICTs should do in this scenario is lower the barriers to information sharing across large populations and wide geographic spaces, which is a key aspect of maintaining a collective action process.    Using case studies of election violence prevention in Kenya and disaster response in Samoa, as well as survey data on the preferred sources and mediums of information people use to take action during crisis, I hypothesized that when people have access to a full spectrum of ICTs they will prefer gathering information though horizontally integrated digital social networks, instead of via vertically integrated broadcast media. I also hypothesize that these effects will be larger among younger, more urban, and wealthier survey respondents. In both the samples from Kenya and Samoa, people across all demographic groups overwhelmingly prefer broadcast and official information when making decisions about what to do during elections and after natural disasters, which ran contrary to my expectations. What is more important to respondents when deciding which information to trust and act on is their previous social and political experiences during elections and post-disaster recovery. Access to government services, political representation, and the geographic distribution of social and familial networks were more salient to respondents when they were deciding where to gather information and how to act on it.   To bring the theoretical and empirical analysis back to the larger question about the use of ICTs in crisis response and violence prevention, I analyze a selection of interventions where international organizations used ICTs in crisis response and violence prevention, discussing how different agency programs encouraged (or failed to encourage) local level information sharing and collective action. This will provide theoretically grounded context for how peace and humanitarian operations practitioners can better develop and tailor technology-supported programming to be more congruous with local information sharing behavior. The dissertation closes with an analysis of the overall findings, implications for the field of technology for peace building and disaster response, and future avenues for research.

T1  - Text2Quit: an analysis of participant engagement in the mobile smoking cessation program
AN  - 1799897312
AB  - Text2Quit, an interactive text-messaging program aimed at smoking cessation, has been shown to increase quit rates, but engagement has not been thoroughly explored. Understanding the program features associated with engagement and behavior change is integral for effective program design. This study explored participants' interaction with the Text2Quit text-messaging program and associations between engagement and smoking cessation. The study included the 262 participants who received the Text2Quit intervention. Self-reported engagement measures, primarily usage of Text2Quit keywords and survey responses, were collected through computer records of participant use. Demographic variables and self-reported smoking abstinence were recorded in surveys at baseline and 6-month assessment. The majority of participants (73%) maintained their subscription during the 6-month intervention. On average, participants received 210.51 text messages, 23.75 emails, and logged into the web portal 1.94 times. Being female was predictive of engagement with the program (β = 15.39). Program engagement, measured by the keyword PLEDGE (p = .002) and the Smokefree Status at 7 Days survey (p < .001) were associated with 6-month abstinence; use of keywords SMOKED (p < .001), RELAPSE (p = .007), and STOP (p = .023) were inversely related to abstinence. While abstainers (N = 83, 31%) stayed enrolled longer and engaged with the program more frequently, program "dose" was not predictive of smoking cessation. Using interactive tools such as pledges and reporting on smoking status were predictive of cessation. Further study of program features is required to understand how to optimally design text messaging programs.

T1  - Text2Quit: an analysis of participant engagement in the mobile smoking cessation program
AN  - 1799888083
AB  - Text2Quit, an interactive text-messaging program aimed at smoking cessation, has been shown to increase quit rates, but engagement has not been thoroughly explored. Understanding the program features associated with engagement and behavior change is integral for effective program design. This study explored participants' interaction with the Text2Quit text-messaging program and associations between engagement and smoking cessation. The study included the 262 participants who received the Text2Quit intervention. Self-reported engagement measures, primarily usage of Text2Quit keywords and survey responses, were collected through computer records of participant use. Demographic variables and self-reported smoking abstinence were recorded in surveys at baseline and 6-month assessment. The majority of participants (73%) maintained their subscription during the 6-month intervention. On average, participants received 210.51 text messages, 23.75 emails, and logged into the web portal 1.94 times. Being female was predictive of engagement with the program (β = 15.39). Program engagement, measured by the keyword PLEDGE (p = .002) and the Smokefree Status at 7 Days survey (p < .001) were associated with 6-month abstinence; use of keywords SMOKED (p < .001), RELAPSE (p = .007), and STOP (p = .023) were inversely related to abstinence. While abstainers (N = 83, 31%) stayed enrolled longer and engaged with the program more frequently, program "dose" was not predictive of smoking cessation. Using interactive tools such as pledges and reporting on smoking status were predictive of cessation. Further study of program features is required to understand how to optimally design text messaging programs.

T1  - Digital media activities and mode of participation in a protest campaign: a study of the Umbrella Movement
AN  - 1730766614
AB  - Although digital media are widely recognized as a predictor of protest participation and a platform for the coordination of connective actions, few studies have examined how digital media activities systematically relate to protesters' mode of participation in protest campaigns. This study aims at filling the research gap through analyzing the Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong. It identifies time spent in the occupied areas, participation leadership, and forms of actions undertaken as three aspects of a protester's mode of participation that can indicate a protester's degree of involvement in the movement. Analysis of a protester onsite survey shows that the protesters were active in four types of digital media activities: online expression, online debates, online explanatory activities, and mobile communication. Digital media activities are generally positively related to degree of involvement, but the four types of activities are also related to the three aspects of mode of participation differently. The findings illustrate how digital media activities are integrated into individualized mode of participation in contemporary connective actions.

T1  - Does Diversification Improve Livelihoods? Pastoral Households in Xinjiang, China
AN  - 1736921391
AB  - Diversification is routinely promoted to improve poor rural peoples' livelihoods. However, policy recommendations for livelihood diversification based on evidence from crop-cultivating sedentary rural societies may not work for mobile pastoral communities, where socio-ecological conditions predetermine livestock herding as the preferred livelihood strategy. Using survey and semi-structured interview data collected from 159 households in the Altay and Tianshan Mountains of Xinjiang, China, this study applies cluster analysis to identify six distinct groups based on livelihood strategies: pastoralists, agropastoralists, crop farmers, wage labourers, hired herders and mixed smallholders. Although pastoralism is the least diverse of these in terms of sources of income, it is significantly more diverse in ecological dimensions such as spatial movement, land use pattern and livestock portfolio. Patterns of livelihood diversification and their relationship with household incomes indicate that pastoralism, although preferred, is unattainable for 55 per cent of households given their meagre asset endowments and the pressure of government policies toward sedentarization. The results strongly suggest that livelihood diversification does not improve welfare for pastoral households. Future development interventions should promote policies that enable households to regain flexible access to pastures and should aim to correct the imbalance of opportunities that exists in northern Xinjiang.

T1  - A test of mechanical ambiguity
AN  - 1736692002
AB  - We implement an experiment to elicit subjects' ambiguity attitudes in the spirit of Ellsberg's three-color urn. The procedure includes three design elements that (together) have not been featured in similar experiments: strict ambiguity preferences, a single decision, and a mechanical randomization device with an unknown distribution (to both subjects and experimenters). We use this device in order to eliminate possible "strategic" ambiguity related to subjects' beliefs about the experimenters' motivations. In addition, we survey 40 experimental studies on Ellsberg's two- and three-color problems, and find that, on average, slightly more than half of subjects are classified as ambiguity averse. Our results, with our new design, fall on the low end of the range of results in the surveyed studies, and are comparable to a control test where "strategic" ambiguity was induced.

T1  - Adolescent-Parent Communication in a Digital World: Differences by Family Communication Patterns
AN  - 1723842594
AB  - We examined how family communication patterns (FCPs) are associated with frequency of adolescent-parent communication in person, over the phone, via text message, and via email. Adolescents (N = 195) aged 13 to 18 completed an online survey assessing FCPs and frequency of communication methods used with parents. The results revealed that both frequency and method of communication differed by general FCPs; adolescents in higher conformity families reported less frequent text messaging with mothers than adolescents in lower conformity families, and adolescents in higher conversation families (mothers only) and lower conformity families reported more frequent email communication with parents. Results set the stage for future research to further explore the processes and outcomes of adolescent-parent communication through communication technology.

T1  - Counseling Online and Over the Phone: When Preclosing Questions Fail as a Closing Device
AN  - 1704740397
AB  - In this article, we present an analysis of closings in two counseling media: online, text-based exchanges (usually referred to as "chat" sessions) and telephone calls. Previous research has found that the participant who initiated a conversation preferably also initiates its termination with a possible preclosing. Advice acknowledgments, lying in the epistemic domain of the client, are devices that may work as preclosings. However, in text-based chat clients regularly refrain from advice acknowledgment. While counselors use various practices to elicit advice acknowledgment in the context of potential advice resistance, hoaxing, and/or seemingly long pauses, these questions do not always succeed as "closing devices." This offers an explanation for counselors' perception of online chatting as more difficult than calling.

T1  - Comparing a Cell Phone Survey and a Web Survey of University Students
AN  - 1686446030
AB  - In many countries, the proportion of the population using cell phones is higher than that with Internet access. Cell phone and Internet penetration rates are high in most university populations. Despite the recent attention focused on surveys of cell phone users, and the preference for using the Internet to survey university students, there have been few studies comparing cell phone surveys and Web surveys of the student population. This article reports on a mode of experiment conducted using an annual survey of students at a large university in South Korea. The frame of registered students contains both cell phone numbers and e-mail addresses. A sample of students was selected from the list and randomly assigned to a computer-assisted telephone interviewing or Web survey mode. Students were notified of the survey in both modes using both text messaging and e-mail messages. We find that the cell phone survey has an advantage over the Web survey in terms of response rates, coverage of key domains, and item nonresponse. Substantive differences between the two modes were found for about half the survey questions. This suggests that cell phone surveys may be useful for surveys in populations with universal or near-universal coverage, and where cell use may be more popular than Internet use.

T1  - Long-term maintenance of smartphone and PDA use in individuals with moderate to severe memory impairment
AN  - 1668325323
AB  - In an earlier paper we described a structured, theory-driven training programme which was administered to 10 individuals with moderate-to-severe memory impairment. All individuals received an errorless-fading-of-cues protocol in the use of personal digital assistants (PDAs) or smartphones (Svoboda, Richards, Leach, & Mertens, 2012) and demonstrated generalisation of acquired skills to day-to-day memory challenges. Maintenance of intervention gains over the long-term is another indicator of successful generalisation. Here we present the maintenance of device use in the same group of individuals 12 to 19 months after programme completion. A within-subject, ABABB multi-case experimental design was used to evaluate the impact of PDA or smartphone use on day-to-day memory functioning at baseline, immediately post-intervention, at return to baseline, and at short-term and long-term follow-up. Results presented here focus predominantly on long-term follow-up. All 10 individuals showed maintenance of gains in day-to-day functioning as quantified across several ecologically valid questionnaire and task-based measures. This was corroborated by family members with whom six of the participants resided. This study further demonstrates the programme's clinical effectiveness in enabling individuals with moderate-to-severe memory impairment to function more independently and with greater confidence up to 19 months following programme completion.

T1  - Connectivity in Later Life: The Declining Age Divide in Mobile Cell Phone Ownership
AN  - 1767327256; 201610024
AB  - In recent decades changes in social connectivity have become key features in the changing contexts of later life. Communities of propinquity no longer seem to be as determining of social relationships as they once were. Mobile cell phone technology and the Internet have redefined what it means to 'keep in touch'. Some authors have argued that these new forms of connectivity have created a 'digital divide' between those who have become active adopters of these technologies and those who have not. Using data from the British General Household Survey (GHS), we examined trends in mobile phone ownership amongst people over fifty during the period 2000 - 2009. Compared with the pace of change in ownership of other household technologies such as personal computers, dishwashers, fridge freezers and microwave ovens, the take up of mobile phones amongst those aged 50 and over has followed a much sharper rise. Based upon these findings, we suggest a more sceptical stance towards the ICT 'generational divide' which needs more detailed interrogation. Future research should consider the possibility that the divide may be a more short lived phenomenon, as successive cohorts of people aged fifty and over are becoming active participants in individualised networked communities.

T1  - Explaining Interview Duration in Web Surveys: A Multilevel Approach
AN  - 1664758844
AB  - Interview duration is an important variable in web surveys because it is a direct measure of the response burden. In this article, we analyze the effects of the survey design, respondent characteristics, and the interaction between these effects on interview duration. For that purpose, we applied multilevel analysis to a data set of 21 web surveys on political attitudes and behavior. Our results showed that factors on both levels, the individual and the survey level, had effects on interview duration. However, the larger share of the variation in interview duration is explained by the characteristics of the respondents. In this respect, we illustrate the impact of mobile devices and panel recruitment on interview duration. In addition, we found important relationships between the respondents' attitudes and how a web survey is designed: Highly motivated respondents spent significantly more time answering cognitively demanding questions than less motivated respondents. When planning a survey, not only the number and formats of questions need to be taken into account but also the expected sample composition and how the participants will respond to the design of the web survey.

T1  - SurveySignal: A Convenient Solution for Experience Sampling Research Using Participants' Own Smartphones
AN  - 1664324498
AB  - Experience sampling or ecological momentary assessment offers unique insights into how people think, feel, and behave in their natural environments. Because the method is able to capture situational variation as it happens in "real time," experience sampling has become an increasingly popular method in social and personality, psychology, and beyond. With the ubiquity of smartphone ownership and the recent technical advances, conducting experience sampling studies on participants' own devices has become increasingly easy to do. Here, we present one reliable, user-friendly, highly customizable, and cost-effective solution. The web-based application, SurveySignal, integrates the idea of using short message service (SMS) messages as signals and reminders, according to fixed or random schedules and of linking these signals to mobile surveys designed with common online survey software. We describe the method and customizable parameters and then present evaluation results from nine social-psychological studies conducted with SurveySignal (overall N = 1,852). Mean response rates averaged 77% and the median response delay to signals was 8 min. An experimental manipulation of the reminder signal in one study showed that installing a reminder SMS led to a 10% increase in response rates. Next to advantages and limitations of the SMS approach, we discuss how ecologically valid research methods such as smartphone experience sampling can enrich psychological research.

T1  - Mobile use of the Internet using smartphones or tablets by Swiss people over 65 years
AN  - 1811868374
AB  - More and more older people are using smartphones or tablet computers; for many it is a viable substitute for a normal mobile phone, or even an entry into the new digital age. With mobile devices, older people can use mobile Internet at home or on the move. Smartphones and tablets allow mobile access to information and communication, so it provides a mobile guide for older adults in their daily lives. But what is the level of acceptance and use of mobile Internet in the older population, and what factors influence the use of these devices? This paper examined older Swiss peoples' acceptance of and attitudes toward the use of smartphones and tablet computers, as well as mobile Internet. A representative study was conducted: a Swiss survey of 1,037 people aged 65 and older. 56% of the older people interviewed used the Internet in the autumn of 2014. 32% of the interviewed owned a smartphone and 26% a tablet computer. Between the age groups and the sociodemographic groups a divide by the mobile devices was found. 34% of Internet users also use mobile Internet. The data showed that, beside lower age, technological affinity and general attitude towards the Internet are positively associated with the use of mobile Internet. The research also showed that many mobile Internet users describe the use of their smartphone as a resource for coping with daily living.

T1  - The Differentiation and Integration of Information Technologies: Three Empirical Studies on 'Bring Your Own Devices'.
AN  - 1767331234; 201607084
AB  - This dissertation examines how the management and configuration of organizational IT portfolios enhance organizations and their employees. Specifically, the theory of the differentiation and integration of information technologies is developed with in-depth examinations of 'Bring-Your-Own-Device' (BYOD) policies. Four data collections are utilized: survey vignettes, case studies, agent-based simulations, and a questionnaire survey. Each essay uses a mixed-method approach providing insights into the selection, development, and management of ITs across individual and organizational levels. Essay 1 explores the impact of BYOD on employees' performance, job satisfaction, and work-life conflicts. The results indicate that IT integration improves performance and job satisfaction, and reduces work-life conflicts. Alternatively, IT differentiation increases work-life conflicts while having no direct impact on performance or job satisfaction. However, the impact of IT differentiation is enhanced when increased IT integration is present in the organization's IT portfolio which in combination provides variety for individuals while ensuring reduced compatibility issues across employee tasks. Essay 2 examines how organizations can configure their IT portfolios over time to meet the demands of varying task portfolios. The results provide insights into optimal levels of IT differentiation and IT integration for varying environments. Increased IT differentiation allows employees to utilize more efficient and effective technologies to meet their specific tasks. However, an increased level of IT integration is needed to meet the additional compatibility concerns arising from this IT differentiation. Essay 3 examines how individual decision-making behaviors and organizational IT policies impact the configuration of IT differentiation and IT integration. A combination of online survey vignettes, agent-based simulations, and a questionnaire survey provides insights into how individuals and organizations can impact the IT portfolio over time. The results indicate that the claimed benefits of BYOD may not materialize unless the employees are choosing their provided technologies based on rational decisions. This dissertation finds that BYOD polices may increase productivity and satisfaction for employees and organizations. However, organizations must ensure they examine their task portfolio, employee technology needs and knowledge, and IT policy attributes to ensure BYOD is the right solution. The results provide organizations increased knowledge to ensure increased performance from their IT decisions. Copies of dissertations may be obtained by addressing your request to ProQuest, 789 E.

T1  - Three essays on social / political structures and ICTs use
AN  - 1767330358; 201607065
AB  - My research identifies how social structures affect the use of the Internet and/or a mobile chat application and how the Internet impacts the political structure of a nation. In my first essay of the 3-essay dissertation, I am designing three models based on social structure theory that are used to study the Internet and a popular mobile chat application's use by managers in South Korea, with the help of a survey instrument. In my first essay, the contribution is on i) testing a model of manager's personal behavior on Information and Communication Technology (ICT) use at the individual level involving managers only ii) understanding social structure characteristics that play a part in technology use, iii) linking the theories of technology acceptance, social structure and adoption/use of ICT and iv) comparing constructs that predict the use of e-mail by the Internet and mobile chat using a mobile messaging application (called 'Kakao talk'), applying the well-known Peterson and Smith framework. The second essay studies the relationship between social structures and use of ICTs at the cross-national level using national and multiple-level models. To explore the relationship between the use of e-mail and social structures (roles, rules and norms), a survey instrument is derived from multiple population surveys that include 3,277 managers from 21 European and four Asian countries. The third essay contributes to the development of a model that examines the role of the Internet on democracy development in these four Asian nations using a Partial Least Squares approach for analysis.

AN  - 1732602722
AB  - The question of what it means to use the concepts of modernity and the modern sounds like an arcane theoretical concern. Were not those issues sorted out at the end of the twentieth century in the Great Debate between the moderns and postmoderns? Did not the postmoderns win that struggle, only to disintegrate a decade later in their infinite recursions into relativism? Are not we now living in a time when we are all a bit modern and a bit postmodern, variously immersed in digital and personal networks of swirling meaning? However, for all of the marginal theoretical interest in the question of the modern today, the concept continues to carry extraordinary unacknowledged weight in mainstream descriptions and arguments. Long after the Great Debate, the modern continues to be counter-posed against other ways of life that are defined in the negative as pre-modern. In other words, those persons living as members of 'pre-modern' communities still do not have their dominant formations named except in the negative or in relation to the higher-order concept of 'the modern'. They are held in place by the prefix 'pre'. This is not to suggest that the writers of such narratives always intend that pre-moderns are lesser peoples. Certainly, contemporary discussions of the Islamic State have gone further than most to link the concept of 'the pre-modern' to the adjective 'evil', but the overwhelming tendency is to just take the term 'modernity' for granted as a description of our times - with the inevitable few wormholes of stagnation or regression eating into the map of modernity. Defining other ways of life in the negative can take the form of both arrogant assumptions of superiority and well-meaning descriptions of 'the Other'. There are even attempts to retrieve the integrity of their pre-modern way of life.Thus, by inference, at least in the gentler version of this narrative, pre-moderns become those who are on an anticipated civilizational climb. They are treated as those who are yet to achieve modern actualization beyond their 'past' identities, anticipating their 'future' potentialities. Thus the prefix 'pre' puts them on a timeline that tends to assume that being before means being less developed, while being later means being more developed. They continue to live in ways that are before modernity, just as 'we', usually designated as Europeans, were the first to take the necessary journey into the modern. When it comes to describing civilizational differences, this journey is said to require a renaissance or major reformation to become more than a technological gloss. They may have mobile phones and run airlines, and they may build tall towers in the desert, but because they did not go through a religious reformation, the continuing archaisms in their culture will always mean that they are prone to recursion, atavism, exotica and ... terrorism. It is amazing how many scholars and politicians in the West have missed the fact that Islam has gone through a series of reformations, not dissimilar to those of Christianity. Just as in the allegory of the Persian love cake, it is their rose petals and saffroncream icing that have seduced us, while it is their archaic or premodern power that we fear. Overall, we have not had time to know them more than at a distance.This tendency to treat the 'pre-moderns' as located at a distance in time is linked to the way in which the equally problematic concept of 'development' is used. The dominant distinction between 'developed' and 'developing' has for the last half century permeated the work of journalists, academics and practitioners. It carries the same sense of a Great Divide between them and us. For all of the attempts to find a different lexicon - Global North and Global South, Minority World and Majority World - the conditional terms 'developed' and 'developing' continue to form the dualism of choice. More than just being the comfortable fall-back position for most television commentators, trade negotiators and aid workers, it sets up a modernist assumption that, given time, there is no alternative. Development is the only achievable condition. In coming from before or in being left behind, the only other possibility apart from developing or being developed is being underdeveloped. In short, they now also include peoples who cannot develop due to actions perpetrated by us. This constituency is similarly defined in the negative - they are 'under' us. By a tightening circle of logic, they are understood as coming from the past and are given no alternative but to develop, stagnate, or succumb to a condition that is made by us. It is no wonder (think the mainstream developmentalists, at least) that they build spectacular and unsustainable towers in the desert. They are trying to transcend the stifling sands of the past.Why is there a common tendency to assume that peoples of the deserts of Arabia to the jungles of Africa and Oceania, from the Mashriq to the Maghreb, have never been modern? Rather than trying to answer this question directly, the present essay uses this question as a point of departure to go back to basics. The essay is not about the Middle East and North Africa, but that region figures largely in the thinking that sits behind the discussion. The essay begins by exploring the general problem of defining modernity and the modern. We then focus, secondly, on a particular approach to elucidate further problems with understanding such categories. I have chosen the approach taken by Bruno Latour's We Have Never Been Modern because many people have turned to this text as a way out of the modernist problem. Here the still-opaque question 'How can one be a Persian?' becomes important. Its relevance will be explained shortly, but to give a hint, the question was first written by an eighteenth-century French social philosopher and put into the mouth of a fictional Persian character. In the third major section, the essay turns to set up an alternative approach to understanding the modern. It emphasizes a reflexively derived, relationally understood and ontologically elaborated approach. Using the metaphor of constitutive levels, it continues to draw upon old concepts such as the customary, traditional, modern and postmodern, but it puts them in a very different context.

T1  - Social influences on young drivers' texting behavior while driving.
AN  - 1718064394; 201530567
AB  - Despite the advances that have been made to enhance vehicular safety, motor vehicle accidents remain one of the greatest public safety concerns in the country. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, in 2010 there were 32,885 people killed in an estimated 5,419,000 police-reported motor vehicle traffic crashes (NHTSA, 2010). Some of these accidents could be prevented if people adopt safer driving habits. Texting behind the wheel is especially an issue among teenagers since text messaging has become the preferred method of communications among teenagers. There is some research that suggests drivers can be influenced by the behavior of their parents or friends. But most of this research has been focused on cell phone use when driving. There is limited research in regards to texting behind the wheel. An anonymous online survey was utilized to collect data from 18-24 year olds, regarding their texting and driving behavior and their parents' and friends' behavior. This survey was distributed through the Steven's Driving Facebook page. 441 responses were collected. The results showed that 81.3 % of young drivers reported texting and driving, which agrees with previous literature. Furthermore, no differences were found in the texting and driving behavior of young drivers of different genders and ages. Drivers, between the age of 18 and 24, that currently text and drive are 2.24 times more likely to have observed their parents texting and driving prior to having their license. Also, young drivers that engage in texting while driving are, 3.8 times more likely to have seen their friends also text and drive. Specifically, young drivers in all three age groups, 18-19, 20-21 and 22-24 are 3.02, 4.11 and 4.0 times more likely to have friends that currently text then those that do not. The influence of peers on texting and driving continue to be a problem. More studies need to be performed on the influence parents have on their children's texting and driving behaviors. Public awareness campaigns need to be developed that focus on telling parents not to text and drive especially when in the presence of their children.

T1  - War on Instagram: Framing conflict photojournalism with mobile photography apps
AN  - 1718067899; 201532403
AB  - This paper examines recent acclaim for professional embedded photojournalists who visually document the experience of US soldiers in Afghanistan using the popular mobile photo application Hipstamatic. These photos have stirred controversy among fellow journalists and cultural critics regarding the use of photo filters in Hipstamatic and similar app Instagram, their contribution to the de-professionalization of photojournalism, and the depiction of war as stylishly vintage. The debates about Hipstamatic and Instagram in war photography open up a whole series of enduring questions about distinctions between photography and illustration, photography and photojournalism, professional and amateur, and reporting and editorializing. In consideration of the shifting nature of digital photography, photojournalism, and specifically war photojournalism, I argue that this discourse about the use of mobile apps overlooks another important ethical issue: the implications of non-soldiers mimicking the imagined hand of the modern smartphone-equipped US soldier, particularly in light of soldiers' own complex media-making practices.

T1  - What's going on? Age, distraction, and multitasking during online survey taking
AN  - 1700675501; 201526196
AB  - Nearly 6000 adults from 7 countries participated in an online survey about what other activities they engaged in while taking the survey and how distracted they felt. Younger people were more likely than older ones to engage in electronic and non-electronic multitasking. Engaging in a wider range of tasks was associated with feeling more distracted. However, once the variety of tasks was taken into account, interruptions associated with checking or talking on one's phone made participants feel less distracted. The relationship between age, multitasking, and feeling distraction was curvilinear, with middle-aged respondents being more affected by multitasking than either younger or older survey takers. The findings suggest that people of all ages are often deliberate multitaskers who choose their distractions intentionally, at least some of the time. This bodes well for researchers seeking to administer online surveys, because it suggests that survey takers will set themselves up with the type and amount of distractions they are comfortable with. The finding that a high degree of electronic multitasking may decrease the perception of distraction should be followed by experiments verifying if this perception corresponds to actual task performance.

T1  - Mobile Response in Web Panels
AN  - 1692290009; 201520920
AB  - This article investigates unintended mobile access to surveys in online, probability-based panels. We find that spontaneous tablet usage is drastically increasing in web surveys, while smartphone usage remains low. Further, we analyze the bias of respondent profiles using smartphones and tablets compared to those using computers, on the basis of several sociodemographic characteristics. Our results indicate not only that mobile web respondents differ from PC users but also that tablet users differ from smartphone users. While tablets are used for survey completion by working (young) adults, smartphones are used merely by the young. In addition, our results indicate that mobile web respondents are more progressive and describe themselves more often as pioneers or forerunners in adopting new technology, compared to PC respondents. We further discover that respondents' preferences for devices to complete surveys are clearly in line with unintended mobile response. Finally, we present a similar analysis on intended mobile response in an experiment where smartphone users were requested to complete a mobile survey. Based on these findings, testing on tablets is strongly recommended in online surveys. If the goal is to reach young respondents, enabling surveys via smartphones should be considered.

T1  - Web-Based Interventions for Youth Internalizing Problems: A Systematic Review
AN  - 1636883692
AB  - To review published reports on Web-based treatment and prevention programs for depression, anxiety, and suicide prevention in children, adolescents, and emerging adults. A systematic search of the PsycINFO, PubMed, Medline, and Web of Science databases was conducted in December 2013. Programs were classified according to evidence-base level (Well-Established, Probably Efficacious, Possibly Efficacious, Experimental, and Of Questionable Efficacy). Of the 14,001 citations initially identified, 25 articles met inclusion criteria for Web-based interventions. These described 9 programs, of which 8 were Internet based and 1 was a mobile application. No Web-based interventions for suicide prevention were identified. Of the randomized controlled trials (n = 14) and open trials (n = 3) identified, 10 reported significant postintervention reductions in symptoms of depression and/or anxiety or improvements in diagnostic ratings, with small to large effect sizes. Many of these studies also reported significant improvements at follow-up. The methodological quality of the studies varied. Many programs were limited by their small sample sizes and use of waitlist or no-treatment control groups. There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of Web-based interventions for youth depression and anxiety. Additional research and program development are needed to fill the current gaps in the literature.

T1  - Improving Response Rates and Questionnaire Design for Mobile Web Surveys
AN  - 1636484190
AB  - This research note presents the results of an experiment that investigated how response rates and data quality could be improved for smartphone web surveys. First, we compare how invitations by text message versus by e-mail affect response rate. Text message invitations result in a similar total response rate as e-mail invitations when considering response via all types of online devices. When considering response via smartphones only, the survey completion rate is significantly higher. The text message contact mode also leads to a faster speed of initial response. Second, we examine the response effects of several questionnaire-design choices when using smartphones: paging versus scrolling, horizontal versus vertical question layout, number of answer options, and open-ended versus closed-ended questions. According to our findings, a scrolling layout leads to a shorter completion time than a paging layout. We further suggest that caution be used with horizontal and long-answer scales as well as open-ended text answer fields in smartphone surveys.

We find that spontaneous tablet usage is drastically increasing in web surveys, while smartphone usage remains low. Further, we analyze the bias of respondent profiles using smartphones and tablets compared to those using computers, on the basis of several sociodemographic characteristics. Our results indicate not only that mobile web respondents differ from PC users but also that tablet users differ from smartphone users. While tablets are used for survey completion by working (young) adults, smartphones are used merely by the young. In addition, our results indicate that mobile web respondents are more progressive and describe themselves more often as pioneers or forerunners in adopting new technology, compared to PC respondents. We further discover that respondents' preferences for devices to complete surveys are clearly in line with unintended mobile response. Finally, we present a similar analysis on intended mobile response in an experiment where smartphone users were requested to complete a mobile survey. Based on these findings, testing on tablets is strongly recommended in online surveys. If the goal is to reach young respondents, enabling surveys via smartphones should be considered.

T1  - Making Mobile Browser Surveys Smarter: Results from a Randomized Experiment Comparing Online Surveys Completed via Computer or Smartphone
AN  - 1700674354; 201525526
AB  - With nearly 50% of U.S. mobile phone subscribers using smartphones, survey researchers are beginning to explore their use as a data collection tool. The Got Healthy Apps Study (GHAS) conducted a randomized experiment to compare mode effects for a survey completed via iPhone mobile browser and online via desktop/laptop computer web browser. Mode effects were assessed for three types of outcomes: randomization/recruitment, survey process/completion, and survey items. In short, the distribution of survey completion times and the distribution of the number of apps owned were significantly different across survey mode after accounting for block group. Other key mode effects outcomes (including open-ended items, slider bar questions, and missing item rates) showed no significant differences across survey mode. Some interesting qualitative findings suggest that iPhone respondents enter more characters and omit fewer items than originally thought.

T1  - Quantifying Political Behavior on Mobile Devices over Time: A User Evaluation Study
AN  - 1667940622; 201507355
AB  - The way citizens use technology has changed dramatically in just the last decade; nearly one-third of American adults own tablets, and almost a half own smartphones. But it is not just ownership that is on the rise; citizens are increasingly using such technology to communicate about and participate in politics. The present study utilized a multimethod approach to tap into how technology affects citizens' political behaviors online in the context of the 2012 U.S. Presidential primary season. Compiling survey data with tablet-tracking behavior in a field experiment, results showed that users spent more days with online aggregators (such as Google and Yahoo), recreational sites (like games), and social interaction sites than news and politics. But when they did spend time with news and politics, they spent an average of 10 minutes on each news page, and national/regional news was the most visited subtopic. User-specific descriptive analyses provide portraits of each user's demographic makeup and online political behavior. Finally, we linked user ideology to user behavior through accurate, real-time behavioral observations. Results suggest that participants are more likely to view news from their own ideological perspective than the other, demonstrating evidence for selective exposure. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Online Activity, Alcohol Use, and Internet Delinquency Among Korean Youth: A Multilevel Approach
AN  - 1629948047
AB  - This study examined the effects of online activity and alcohol use on Internet delinquency using data sets from the Korea Youth Panel Survey and focusing on adolescents in their 10th grade in high school (Wave 3). The current study investigated differences in Internet delinquency at Level 1 and Level 2. The units of Level 1 were students and those of Level 2 were schools. The total sample size for this study was 2,854 students at Level 1 and 166 schools at Level 2. Given the hierarchical nature of this data set, this study used hierarchical generalized linear modeling to determine that those youth who drank, used computer games, and used mobile phones were more likely to engage in Internet delinquency compared to nondrinkers, non-computer users, and non-mobile phone users.

T1  - Socio-demographic gaps in mobile use, causes, and consequences: a multi-group analysis of the mobile divide model
AN  - 1545061006
AB  - This study examines mobile divide by gender, age, social economic status (SES), and social capital using a conceptual model of mobile divide. This model is composed of eight components of mobile divide which are divided into the following three groups: two antecedents of mobile use including innovativeness and competence, two types of actual mobile use (talk and non-talk), and consequences of mobile use including life management, resource use, network management, and personal identity display. Through a survey of 400 mobile users in Korea, our study verified the validity of the proposed model. In addition, this model enables us to examine mobile divide in two different approaches - at the level of each component and in the relations among the components. Mobile divides by gender, age, SES, and social capital existed at the level of various components. Age and SES even showed significant mobile divides in the relations between mobile uses and consequence-related components. Implications of the results in our study along with the two types of approaches to mobile divide are discussed.

T1  - Mobile Phone Usage Preferences: The Contributing Factors of Personality, Social Anxiety and Loneliness
AN  - 1680152406; 201517125
AB  - Psychological factors and social relationships are important components that influence an individual's communication style. This paper aims to examine the association of personality factors, social anxiety (SA) and loneliness with mobile phone (MP) usage preferences on the basis of voice calling and text messaging. Malaysian MP users (N = 187) completed four questionnaires (Mobile Phone Usage Questionnaire, Big Five Inventory, Interaction Anxiousness Scale and UCLA Loneliness Scale) on paper or online via a web-link. Multiple regression analyses revealed that personality, SA and loneliness broadly predicted preferences for voice calling or text messaging. Further analyses examining the predictability of time spent on voice calls/text messaging and number of people called/exchanged text messages also revealed some significant findings in regards to the openness-to-experience personality dimension, loneliness and SA. The findings of this research have important implications to tailoring the delivery of psychological services to individuals diagnosed with chronic loneliness and SA.

T1  - The invisible interviewer: old and new methodological issues in online research
AN  - 1642595637
AB  - Over the last two decades, computer-mediated and online research methods have been gaining ground over traditional data collection tools for research. As a consequence, the role of the interviewer is affected. In this article, the visibility or invisibility of the interviewer is used to express the degree of control that the interviewer has in the interviewing process. For example, the interviewer has full control in face-to-face interviews, but this control decreases as the interviewer's level of visibility decreases, such as in phone interviews, and is nullified when the interviewer is missing entirely, such as in self-administered surveys on the Web. This raises the question of how the visibility of the interviewer is currently surrogated and how the solutions adopted in social research may be suitable for describing the corresponding impact of digital technologies on social life. In concluding, possible scenarios of new digitally mediated solutions of data collection are presented.

T1  - What Happens if You Offer a Mobile Option to Your Web Panel? Evidence From a Probability-Based Panel of Internet Users
AN  - 1692290774; 201520952
AB  - This article reports from a pilot study that was conducted in a probability-based online panel in the Netherlands. Two parallel surveys were conducted: one in the traditional questionnaire layout of the panel and the other optimized for mobile completion with new software that uses a responsive design (optimizes the layout for the device chosen). The latter questionnaire was optimized for mobile completion, and respondents could choose whether they wanted to complete the survey on their mobile phone or on a regular desktop. Results show that a substantive number of respondents (57%) used their mobile phone for survey completion. No differences were found between mobile and desktop users with regard to break offs, item nonresponse, time to complete the survey, or response effects such as length of answers to an open-ended question and the number of responses in a check-all-that-apply question. A considerable number of respondents gave permission to record their GPS coordinates, which are helpful in defining where the survey was taken. Income, household size, and household composition were found to predict mobile completion. In addition, younger respondents, who typically form a hard-to-reach group, show higher mobile completion rates. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - Unraveling the relationships between smartphone use, exposure to heterogeneity, political efficacy, and political participation: a mediation model approach
AN  - 1660024518; 201506416
AB  - This paper assesses how use of smartphones relates to exposure to heterogeneity, political efficacy, and political engagement and suggests a new mediation model that can be applied to mobile communication. Drawing on online survey data collected during the 2012 presidential election in South Korea, this study finds that exposure to heterogeneity and political efficacy jointly mediate the impact of informational uses of smartphones on political participation. The current study also shows that informational uses of smartphones are significantly related to encounters with heterogeneity, political efficacy, and participatory behaviors. Additionally, recreational uses of smartphones were found to have a positive association with exposure to heterogeneity. However, relational uses of smartphones were not associated with democratic outcomes. The findings suggest that smartphones, by increasing the possibility of encountering diversity and subsequently enhancing political efficacy, create an additional pathway to citizen engagement in democratic processes.

T1  - Should I Stay or Should I Go? An Analysis of the Determinants of Intra-European Student Mobility
AN  - 1660022313; 201508588
AB  - In recent years, organised student mobility within the European space has increasingly caught the interest of scholarly researchers. As the focus of most research projects has been on the outcome of mobility programmes, studies into the determinants of credit student mobility remain rather focused on individual decision-making. However, in order to gain a more profound understanding of how students' motivations to participate in international mobility programmes are shaped, we have to go a step further. Therefore, in this paper, we present a study into the determinants of intra-European student mobility, conducted in Austria, Belgium, Italy, Norway, Poland, and UK, taking into account students' personal background and motivations. The results are based on an online survey (n=5654) and in-depth interviews and focus groups with non-mobile as well as ex-mobile students (n=71). The results show that mobility decisions are socially and biographically embedded. Moreover, we provide evidence that the decision to spend a study period abroad cannot be fully understood without taking into consideration the macroeconomic context.

T1  - Looking Beyond Demographics: Panel Attrition in the ANES and GSS
AN  - 1547331357
AB  - Longitudinal or panel surveys offer unique benefits for social science research, but they typically suffer from attrition, which reduces sample size and can result in biased inferences. Previous research tends to focus on the demographic predictors of attrition, conceptualizing attrition propensity as a stable, individual-level characteristic -- some individuals (e.g., young, poor, residentially mobile) are more likely to drop out of a study than others. We argue that panel attrition reflects both the characteristics of the individual respondent as well as her survey experience, a factor shaped by the design and implementation features of the study. In this article, we examine and compare the predictors of panel attrition in the 2008-2009 American National Election Study, an online panel, and the 2006-2010 General Social Survey, a face-to-face panel. In both cases, survey experience variables are predictive of panel attrition above and beyond the standard demographic predictors, but the particular measures of relevance differ across the two surveys. The findings inform statistical corrections for panel attrition bias and provide study design insights for future panel data collections.

T1  - 'I Hate Everything About You': A Qualitative Examination of Cyberbullying and On-Line Aggression in a College Sample
AN  - 1531933635; 201423112
AB  - Due to highly innovative technologies such as the smart phone, cyberbullying and on-line aggression have increasingly affected individuals across the world. In this study, a broad symbolic interactionist approach is used to study both cyberbullying and on-line aggression. Cyberbullying is defined as repeated unwanted, hurtful, harassing, and/or threatening interaction through electronic communication media. On-line aggression is defined as hurtful, harassing, and/or threatening behavior that is not repeated. Undergraduate students at a Midwestern university (N = 221) were surveyed to determine the extent and nature of their cyberbullying and on-line aggression experiences. By using open ended questions to inquire about respondents' personal experiences with cyberbullying and on-line aggression, we identified three motivations for these acts, which included cyber sanctioning, power struggles, and entertainment.

T1  - Comparison of Smartphone and Online Computer Survey Administration
AN  - 1531933881; 201422705
AB  - The dramatic rise of smartphones has profound implications for survey research. Namely, can smartphones become a viable and comparable device for self-administered surveys? The current study is based on approximately 1,500 online U.S. panelists who were smartphone users and who were randomly assigned to the mobile app or online computer mode of a survey. Within the survey, we embedded several experiments that had been previously tested in other modes (mail, PC web, mobile web). First, we test whether responses in the mobile app survey are sensitive to particular experimental manipulations as they are in other modes. Second, we test whether responses collected in the mobile app survey are similar to those collected in the online computer survey. Our mobile survey experiments show that mobile survey responses are sensitive to the presentation of frequency scales and the size of open-ended text boxes, as are responses in other survey modes. Examining responses across modes, we find very limited evidence for mode effects between mobile app and PC web survey administrations. This may open the possibility for multimode (mobile and online computer) surveys, assuming that certain survey design recommendations for mobile surveys are used consistently in both modes.

T1  - The politics of transnational affective capital: Digital connectivity among young Somalis stranded in Ethiopia
AN  - 1530280057
AB  - This article presents an explorative qualitative case study of how sixteen young Somali migrants stranded in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia feel about staying in touch with loved ones abroad using Internet-based transnational communication. Left-behind during transit migration from Somalia to overseas, at this moment they can only digitally connect with contacts living inside for example dreamed diasporic locations in Europe. Based on in-depth interviews, a focus group and concept maps drawn by informants the ambivalent workings of affects spurred by transnational communication are explored. The intense feelings of togetherness originating in Skype video-chat, mobile phone calls and Facebook use are conceptualized with the notion of transnational affective capital - one of the only sources of capital the informants have. The ambivalence of transnational affective capital is scrutinized by exploring whether such connectivity routines offer trust, enable anxiety management and promote 'ontological security'. Alternatively, the question arises whether transnational communication may further exacerbate ontological insecurity: discomfort, unsettlement and increased anxiety related to the precarious situation of being stranded.

T1  - The plural iPod: A study of technology in action
AN  - 1541997661; 201427794
AB  - Based on a study of iPod use amongst 155 undergraduate students, the article argues that an emphasis on the mediated constitution of what Bull (2007) calls "auditory bubbles" raises limited questions around the situated and varied practices of iPod users. The article instead suggests that we need to develop more sophisticated understandings of how mobile digital devices are used and appropriated in context, not just by letting users tell their own stories but by listening carefully to how these stories point to anomalies, variations and discordances in their use and non-use.

T1  - Mobility, Power and the Emerging New Mobilities Regimes
AN  - 1767325478; 201608028
AB  - This paper presents various aspects of mobilities regimes. It shows that - from the body to the globe - modern life, economies and cultural activities are shaped and governed by powerful and influential sets of principles, norms and rules concerning physical, virtual and social mobility. Since the formulation of the 'new mobilities paradigm' approach questions of power and governance become increasingly relevant in theory and empirical research. The author presents four analytical dimensions helping to understand the power structures in mobilities: the normalization of mobility is discussed as an overarching process which involves the rationalization, subjectification, and time-space compression of modern mobilities. The paper argues for a research agenda that critically investigates the micro-, meso and macro-scalar dimensions of mobilities regimes in order to provide the ground for new policies of sustainable mobility.

T1  - Improving Response Rates and Questionnaire Design for Mobile Web Surveys
AN  - 1735655465; 201537256
AB  - This research note presents the results of an experiment that investigated how response rates and data quality could be improved for smartphone web surveys. First, we compare how invitations by text message versus by e-mail affect response rate. Text message invitations result in a similar total response rate as e-mail invitations when considering response via all types of online devices. When considering response via smartphones only, the survey completion rate is significantly higher. The text message contact mode also leads to a faster speed of initial response. Second, we examine the response effects of several questionnaire-design choices when using smartphones: paging versus scrolling, horizontal versus vertical question layout, number of answer options, and open-ended versus closed-ended questions. According to our findings, a scrolling layout leads to a shorter completion time than a paging layout. We further suggest that caution be used with horizontal and long-answer scales as well as open-ended text answer fields in smartphone surveys. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The coat check interactive augmented reality installation in perspective.
AN  - 1629332892; 201441569
AB  - Technological Displacement: The Coat Check Interactive AR Installation in Perspective is a two-part dissertation that involves the research/creation of an augmented reality installation and a textual critique of displacement both as a socio-cultural phenomenon and a technology-driven status quo. Digital technologies involve a series of displacements from data storage and transfer to creating global networks. Going hand in hand with human mobilities technological displacement affects our lives and interactions deeply. Multimedia and digital overlaying of information and interconnectedness (mobile devices, tracking technologies, the internet...) make up our quotidian in various degrees, impelling us to be 'present' in time and places we actually are not. Technological displacement may be viewed as an extension of physical displacement of individuals and communities in that the need to reconcile, re-invent and innovatively market proximity becomes more and more an underlying theme of contemporary lives. Nowhere the reorientations of presence is more accentuated than 'augmented space', as described by Lev Manovich, ' a physical space overlaid with dynamically changing information, multimedia in form and localized for each user.'(219) It may be argued that our sense of reality is already 'augmented' by digital stimuli in many ways. Here I make the case that in an augmented or digitally enhanced environment we are displaced multiple times, or 'multiplaced'. Augmentation is superimposing multimedia to real space, blurring the boundary between the real and the virtual, creating a heterogeneous space defined neither by the standards of the virtual nor the real but the coexistence and cooperation of both. Augmented reality functions on the principle of multiple displacements in that real space is not a backdrop to multimedia: it is indispensable to the overall embodied experience. I created The Coat Check in 2011 using motion tracking technologies (Intersense IS900), specialized cameras (Point Grey 360^' Spherical Vision Camera), screens (FogScreen), software (Max/MSP), tools and applications (Snapdragon AR). The conceptualization of The Coat Check is based on an analogy between digital technologies and coat checks that are both storage, retrieval and displacement systems. The Coat Check also raises questions on identity and history as it refers to belonging, temporality, and mobility. This project is inspired by the work of Mona Hatoum and Kutlug Ataman. Both artists' installations focus on the dialectics of the interior and exterior, past and present, memory and amnesia. This research originates from questions of identity, mobility and memory and evolves towards an understanding of technological displacement.

T1  - Voice activated personal assistant: Privacy concerns in the public space (Voice Activated Personal Assistant, Information processing, Mobile, Smartphone, Public space and privacy).
AN  - 1567045894; 201434913
AB  - An online survey was conducted to investigate the likelihood of usage of the smartphone Voice Activated Personal Assistant (VAPA) such as Apple's Siri (compared to the usage of smartphone keyboard) as a function of location (private versus public) and type of information (private versus non-private) to inform design decisions to make the private use of the VAPA in public spaces more acceptable from the user point of view. Responses from 76 participants showed that users were more cautious of transmitting private than non-private information. This effect of type of information was amplified in the social context of public locations and when using conspicuous methods of information input such as the VAPA. Participants also preferred using the VAPA in private locations and showed no preference of location for keyboard entries. Correlations between likelihood of usage of VAPA and the social acceptability ratings were positive and predicted similar patterns of smartphone usage.

T1  - Enacting work space in the flow: Sensemaking about mobile practices and blurring boundaries.
AN  - 1520320586; 201414639
AB  - An increasing portion of the contemporary workforce is using mobile devices to create new kinds of work-space flows characterized by emergence, liquidity, and the blurring of all kinds of boundaries. This changes the traditional notion of the term workplace. The present study focuses on how people enact and make sense of new work space boundaries enabled by their mobile practices. A unique method of data collection -- the use of cultural probes -- was adapted to an online format to facilitate participant reflection and documentation of mobile practices. Coupled with in-depth interviews, this methodology enabled the thick description of how individuals enacted spatial, temporal, and psychosocial boundaries of work spaces through their mobile practices. Key findings include (a) evidence of the increasing individuation of work space enacted through mobile devices, (b) an observable collapse in the boundaries between work and personal/leisure domains, (c) diversity in an individual's sensemaking about reconstituted lifespace, and (d) evolving social norms as prior office-based norms are called into question. These findings contribute a more accurate picture of the contemporary workplace by providing insight into what kinds of work space, time, and psychosocial structures and flows are emerging through mobile practices -- insight that bears on designing, developing, and managing the workplace under conditions of mobile technology use.

T1  - False memories for dissonance inducing events.
AN  - 1520315019; 201412505
AB  - Memories serve as a 'database' of the self and people may produce distorted memories that support their self-concepts. Dissonance theory suggests self-consistency is a fundamental human motivation. Inconsistency between beliefs and actions leads people to adopt various strategies to effectively restore consonance. Because instances of dissonance are counter to most people's self-concept, people may misremember past dissonance-inducing events in ways that promote their self-concept (i.e., consistency). Current models of memory and motivated cognition, specifically M. A. Conway's (2005) self-memory system (SMS), can incorporate dissonance processes and account for false memories. In the current report, we describe the results of two experiments designed to establish the link between cognitive dissonance and false memories. In Experiment 1 participants made either an easy or a difficult choice between two smart phones. Either immediately or two days later, participants reported their memories for their decision experience and phone specifications. Participants in the difficult choice conditions produced the expected spread of alternatives effect and were more likely than those in the easy conditions to misremember their initial decision as easier and more satisfactory than they had initially rated it. Delay did not influence participants' memories. In Experiment 2, participants either chose or were forced to write a counterattitudinal essay supporting a tuition increase and were afforded the opportunity to reduce dissonance via attitude shift or denial of responsibility by way of a question-order manipulation embedded in a questionnaire. They then reported their memories for the experimental instructions and their initial attitudes (assessed via online questionnaire two days prior to the laboratory session). Participants who chose to write the essay shifted their attitudes to be more favorable toward a tuition increase than those who were forced to write the essay. Additionally, they misremembered their initial attitudes as more favorable toward a tuition increase, and were more likely to misremember the experimental instruction. We did not replicate the denial of responsibility mode of dissonance reduction. Overall, the results from the present studies provide preliminary evidence that cognitive dissonance can yield memory distortion under certain circumstances. Theoretical implications and directions for future research are discussed. Copies of dissertations may be obtained by addressing your request to ProQuest, 789 E. Eisenhower Parkway, P.O.

T1  - Data Quality in PC and Mobile Web Surveys
AN  - 1504423341; 201405063
AB  - The considerable growth in the number of smart mobile devices with a fast Internet connection provides new challenges for survey researchers. In this article, I compare the data quality between two survey modes: self-administered web surveys conducted via personal computer and those conducted via mobile phones. Data quality is compared based on five indicators: (a) completion rates, (b) response order effects, (c) social desirability, (d) non-substantive responses, and (e) length of open answers. I hypothesized that mobile web surveys would result in lower completion rates, stronger response order effects, and less elaborate answers to open-ended questions. No difference was expected in the level of reporting in sensitive items and in the rate of non-substantive responses. To test the assumptions, an experiment with two survey modes was conducted using a volunteer online access panel in Russia. As expected, mobile web was associated with a lower completion rate, shorter length of open answers, and similar level of socially undesirable and non-substantive responses. However, no stronger primacy effects in mobile web survey mode were found. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - Use of Web and Phone Survey Modes to Gather Data from Adults about Their Young Adult Children: An Evaluation Based on a Randomized Design
AN  - 1504424264; 201405740
AB  - Mode effects on responses to survey items may introduce bias to data collected using multiple modes of administration. The present study examines data from 704 surveys conducted as part of a longitudinal study in which parents and their children had been surveyed at multiple prior time points. Parents of 22-year-old study participants were randomly assigned to one of two mixed-mode conditions: (1) web mode first followed by the offer of an interviewer-administered telephone mode; or (2) telephone mode first followed by the offer of the web mode. Comparison of responses by assigned condition on 12 measures showed one statistically significant difference. Analyses that modeled differences by completed mode and the interaction between assigned condition and completed mode found significant differences on six measures related to completed mode. None of the differences indicated that more socially desirable responses were given in interviewer-administered surveys. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - Media Markets and Minority Languages in the Digital Age
AN  - 1696162304
AB  - This article discusses the changing role of the media for minority languages in the context of the development of the digital media market. Media use in minority languages is affected by the position of the language in a growing digital market. The role of the media in daily language use is assessed against a development whereby digital media play an ever greater role due to increased daily usage of media. The asymmetric position of minority languages makes them particularly vulnerable to unfavourable changes in the media landscape. Internet-based and mobile digital media are likely to introduce such changes. The key question addressed in this article is whether the media landscape in its new form can maintain its institutional capacity to embrace and serve minority languages, and under what conditions. How are the intentions that are inherent in international policy instruments for the protection and promotion of minority languages served if these instruments are not applied according to the requirements set by the new conditions? The article calls for measures to balance the negative effects of the digital changes on minority languages by strengthening policy measures in this field. The empirical focus of the article leans towards developments in Western Europe, with a view towards examples elsewhere.

T1  - New data collection modes for surveys: a comparative analysis of the influence of survey mode on question-wording effects
AN  - 1680153789; 201513367
AB  - New opportunities have recently emerged in survey practice, coupled with a need to make changes, and alternative survey data collection modes such as those based on new technologies (for example, the Web and mobile phones) have become a focus of interest. Studies have considered the biases due to data collection modes and to the wording of questions in questionnaires, but they have rarely dealt with the interaction between the two phenomena. This paper presents the results of a study on the interactions between some of the best-known question-wording effects and three data collection modes: face-to-face, Web-based and SMS-based (Short Text Messaging). The results have highlighted some interesting characteristics of the various modes-innovative ones in particular-and have confirmed the existence of potential interactions between data collection modes and question-wording effects. The findings may have significant implications for the study and practice of surveys and entail that, when surveys are designed, account is taken of specific factors associated with the method used to word the questions in questionnaires.

T1  - Communicating Practice in Transnational Advocacy: Examples from Southeast Asia
AN  - 1551001993; 201429779
AB  - The proliferation of digital technology-both as hardware and software-provides opportunities for activist groups around the world to connect with one another more rapidly and efficiently than ever before. And as mobile Internet technology (including smartphones, personal digital assistants, and laptops) becomes cheaper and more readily available, the number of services offered to individuals has increased dramatically, including voice communication, Internet browsing, and data transfer. At the same time, the rise in transnational advocacy networks means that non-state actors are garnering new voices and challenging both old and new sites of authority, from local governments and state agencies to regional and international organizations. Based on fieldwork and with a focus on the process of interaction within transnational groups in Southeast Asia, this article adopts a communities of practice (COP) approach and applies it to the impact of digital networking in order to test some of the questions posed about the nature of the so-called technological revolution and to assess the ways in which technological advancement has affected these groups. It hypothesizes that even new and potentially levelling forms of communication can only respond to and reshape the pre-existing social conditions and organizational structures within which network participants function.

T1  - Comparing Survey Results Obtained via Mobile Devices and Computers: An Experiment With a Mobile Web Survey on a Heterogeneous Group of Mobile Devices Versus a Computer-Assisted Web Survey
AN  - 1438556161; 201339794
AB  - With the growing popularity of smartphones and tablet PCs (tablets) equipped with mobile browsers, the possibilities to administer surveys via mobile devices have expanded. To investigate the possible mode effect on answer behavior, results are compared between a mobile device-assisted web survey and a computer-assisted web survey. First, a premeasurement in the CentERpanel is conducted to analyze the user group of mobile devices. Second, the users are randomly allocated one of the three conditions: (1) conventional computer-assisted web survey, (2) hybrid version: a computer-assisted web survey with a layout similar to mobile web survey, and (3) mobile web survey. Special attention is given to the design of the mobile web questionnaire, taking small screen size, and typical functionalities for touchscreens into account. The findings suggest that survey completion on mobile devices need not lead to different results than on computers, but one should be prepared for a lower response rate and longer survey completion time. Further, the study offers considerations for researchers on survey satisfaction, location during survey completion, and preferred device to access Internet. With adaptations, surveys can be conducted on the newest mobile devices, although new challenges are emerging and further research is called for.

T1  - Post-human viewing: a discussion of the ethics of mobile phone imagery
AN  - 1429636603; 201336670
AB  - This article discusses the relationship between theories of photography and mobile phone footage. In doing so, it asks if theories of photography still apply in a technologically saturated world of imagery. Technology is an increasingly important part of viewing imagery today and enables imagery to become part of a global cultural flow, thus calling into question the physical connection between viewer and image. This article analyses what happens to that connection when not only the image but also the physical body is mediated and challenged in post-human relations, and examines the ensuing ethical implications. The author takes photojournalism and, in particular, mobile phone footage as a starting point for an exploration of the (post-human) body as evidence and sign of authenticity in the modern age of digital communications and journalism.

T1  - Comparing Survey Results Obtained via Mobile Devices and Computers: An Experiment With a Mobile Web Survey on a Heterogeneous Group of Mobile Devices Versus a Computer-Assisted Web Survey
AN  - 1400269257
AB  - With the growing popularity of smartphones and tablet PCs (tablets) equipped with mobile browsers, the possibilities to administer surveys via mobile devices have expanded. To investigate the possible mode effect on answer behavior, results are compared between a mobile device-assisted web survey and a computer-assisted web survey. First, a premeasurement in the CentERpanel is conducted to analyze the user group of mobile devices. Second, the users are randomly allocated one of the three conditions: (1) conventional computer-assisted web survey, (2) hybrid version: a computer-assisted web survey with a layout similar to mobile web survey, and (3) mobile web survey. Special attention is given to the design of the mobile web questionnaire, taking small screen size, and typical functionalities for touchscreens into account. The findings suggest that survey completion on mobile devices need not lead to different results than on computers, but one should be prepared for a lower response rate and longer survey completion time. Further, the study offers considerations for researchers on survey satisfaction, location during survey completion, and preferred device to access Internet. With adaptations, surveys can be conducted on the newest mobile devices, although new challenges are emerging and further research is called for. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - 'It's Almost like Talking to a Person': Student Disclosure to Pedagogical Agents in Sensitive Settings
AN  - 1438667215; 201322085
AB  - This paper presents findings of a pilot study which used pedagogical agents to examine disclosure in educational settings. The study used responsive evaluation to explore how use of pedagogical agents might affect students' truthfulness and disclosure by asking them to respond to a lifestyle choices survey delivered by a web-based pedagogical agent. Findings indicate that emotional connection with pedagogical agents was intrinsic to the user's sense of trust and therefore likely to affect levels of truthfulness and engagement. The implications of this study are that truthfulness, personalisation and emotional engagement are all vital components in using pedagogical agents to enhance online learning.

T1  - Palm or Cell? Comparing Personal Digital Assistants and Cell Phones for Experience Sampling Research
AN  - 1373427890; 201328094
AB  - Personal digital assistants (PDA), particularly Palm Pilots, are popular data collection devices in experience sampling research. The declining availability of such devices, however, has prompted researchers to explore alternative technologies for signaling participants and collecting responses. The present research considers interactive voice response (IVR) methods, which can deliver questions and collect data using common cell phones. Participants completed an experience sampling study using either a PDA (n = 428) or a cell phone under three different conditions (IVR condition n = 98; IVR Callback condition n = 93; IVR Callback Comeback condition n = 94). We found that response rates were higher when people used PDAs (69%) than when they used their cell phones (IVR condition = 51%), but response rates increased when people could call back within a few minutes of missing a signal (IVR Callback condition = 58%) and had a face-to-face meeting with a researcher midweek (IVR Callback Comeback = 64%). The daily life ratings were similar across the conditions. The findings are encouraging for researchers interested in using IVR cell phone methods for ecological momentary assessment, but more work is needed to develop procedures or incentives that increase response rates.

T1  - Intra-European Student Mobility and European Identity: A Successful Marriage?
AN  - 1417524369; 201334979
AB  - Studies on European identity generally focus on elites, even though processes of identity formation may also take place in other societal domains. As one of the underlying rationales of European student exchange programmes is the promotion of European citizenship, I examine empirically the influence of European student mobility on European identity. The analysis is based on a mixed-method approach. The quantitative element consists of an online survey at nine universities in Austria, Belgium, Italy, Norway, and Poland at the end of the 2008-2009 academic year. The qualitative element consists of 40 in-depth interviews and five focus groups, conducted at the universities of Antwerp, Innsbruck, Oslo, Rome, and Warsaw in 2009-2010. The analysis underpins the need for incorporating an 'experience-based' social dimension into the existing theoretical frameworks of political and cultural dimensions of European identity. This creation of an 'experience-based social Europe' among mobile students is the result of socialisation processes that are characterised by internal and external identity observations and goes beyond the political unit of the European Union. However, regional differences can be observed and partially attributed to macro-factors such as the (non-)participation of a country in the European Union. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Multimodal Communication, Idealization, and Relational Quality in College Students' Parental Relationships
AN  - 1322725224; 201314716
AB  - This study described the multimodal communication patterns of college students and their parents, and examined how face-to-face and mediated communication frequencies relate to parental idealization and relational quality. Undergraduate students (N = 678) completed an online survey that assessed indicators of idealization (idealistic distortion and positive affect thinking), relational quality (relational/communication satisfaction, and relational closeness), and the frequency of face-to-face and mediated parental communication. Results indicated that average college students communicate with their primary parent 23 times per week, mostly via phone calls, text messaging, and face-to-face interaction. The frequency of mediated communication was positively related to both indicators of idealization and both indicators of relational quality. Moreover, idealization partially mediated the relationship between mediated communication frequency and relational quality. The frequency of face-to-face communication was inversely related to positive affect thinking. Indirect effects were also detected, such that face-to-face communication was negatively related to both indicators of relational quality as a function of positive affect thinking. Finally, this study examined whether students experience different levels of parental idealization and relational quality depending on whether their parent is geographically close or geographically distant, and whether they reside with their parent. Results indicated that students who live geographically distant from their parent experienced greater levels of idealization and relational quality than did student who live geographically close to yet separate from their parent, who reported greater levels of idealization and relational quality than students who live with their parent. These results were interpreted using concepts from interpersonal, family, and computer-mediated communication. Limitations and directions for future research were discussed.

T1  - Technology Innovations in Publishing: New Directions in Academic and Cultural Communication
AN  - 1641424507; 201501176
AB  - Over time, publishing technologies have not only influenced how people read, but also how knowledge is evaluated and authority is established. Social and mobile technologies represent relatively recent developments that have transformed the trade publishing world, but the extent to which they have affected academic publishing remains an open question. This article examines the rapid and disruptive transformations in the trade and digital publishing world, discusses how these developments have already intersected with the work of academics and considers how these changes might continue to transform the dissemination of academic research in the future.

T1  - Media Markets and Minority Languages in the Digital Age
AN  - 1629330321; 201427891
AB  - This article discusses the changing role of the media for minority languages in the context of the development of the digital media market. Media use in minority languages is affected by the position of the language in a growing digital market. The role of the media in daily language use is assessed against a development whereby digital media play an ever greater role due to increased daily usage of media. The asymmetric position of minority languages makes them particularly vulnerable to unfavourable changes in the media landscape. Internet-based and mobile digital media are likely to introduce such changes. The key question addressed in this article is whether the media landscape in its new form can maintain its institutional capacity to embrace and serve minority languages, and under what conditions. How are the intentions that are inherent in international policy instruments for the protection and promotion of minority languages served if these instruments are not applied according to the requirements set by the new conditions? The article calls for measures to balance the negative effects of the digital changes on minority languages by strengthening policy measures in this field. The empirical focus of the article leans towards developments in Western Europe, with a view towards examples elsewhere. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Oversight in the era of 'Snowden' and big data: challenges and opportunities
AN  - 1629329343; 201427877
AB  - Global security has been at the top of the international agenda during the last decade and is very likely to remain high-ranking in the years to come. Especially in the light of the international threat of terrorism, an additional budget and powers have been put at the disposal of nation states across the globe to counter threats and to maximize global and national security. Only recently broader attention has been generated to look into the unintended side-effects of the efforts of all those states. Especially the revelations by the American whistleblower Edward Snowden have raised questions about the scale of the efforts to maximize global security, for example, by the surveillance of global communications. The Norwegian Helsinki Committee recommends in this context to further clarity the judicial framework of internet and mobile phone surveillance and suggests that the OSCE should become a pioneer in setting standards for states to respect the right to privacy online.

T1  - Cops, cameras and accountability: User-generated online video and public space police-civilian interactions
AN  - 1520339764; 201411789
AB  - Video captured by increasingly ubiquitous civilian cameras and communicated to a mass audience over the Internet is capable of bypassing police jurisdictional influence over traditional mass media and may be affecting police-civilian interactions in American public space as the initial cusp of a paradigm shift. Historically, the ability to visually record activities in public space was reserved to those with the resources and the motivation to devote to the task. Police and traditional mass media wielded power through cameras, power often not available to the public. Today, police often find their cameras outnumbered by those under autonomous citizen control. An inexpensive cell phone can instantly publish user-generated video to Internet servers available to a world audience and beyond local police jurisdiction. Police leverage on local media outlets appears insufficient to suppress imagery. Police-civilian public space interactions are often among the lowest level, highest stakes interactions in the United States. Police powers are restricted by systems which often depend on police cooperation. One organizational behavior pattern is that police will sometimes lie to protect themselves and other police, including perjury, making false reports, and destroying or denying the existence of video evidence of police misconduct. Technological developments underlying these problems are likely to continue along current paths. The stated issues have significant implications for the continued exercise of First Amendment rights in photographing public space, for Fourth Amendment protections against search and seizure and arrest without probable cause, and for police accountability. The research question is, What is the outcome of user-generated online video on police-civilian interactions in American public space? This descriptive multiple-case study based on document analysis of publicly available documents examined 14 police-civilian interactions in American public space between 2005-2010 for the influence (if any) of user-generated online video on their outcomes. Based on cross-case analysis of 38 variables of interest, generalizing to theory indicates that user-generated online video can improve accountability in police-civilian interactions. Several robust theories are proposed, and numerous opportunities for future research are delineated. Copies of dissertations may be obtained by addressing your request to ProQuest, 789 E.

T1  - Changes in Reading Behavior Among eReader Adopters
AN  - 1520331410; 201422639
AB  - As part of the digital publishing revolution, the advent of eReader devices has had a strong impact on the reading habits of ordinary people and the traditional publishing industry. This study investigated how people have changed their reading behavior with the rise of the eReader by analyzing the amount of reading of different material and their media preferences among different platforms. An online survey was designed to study the changes in reading habits of faculty and staff from the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). On January 13th, 2011, an email with a survey link was sent through the RIT e-mail system. The survey was closed after two weeks. Of the 3,600 potential respondents, 600 started the survey, while 563 completed the survey yielding a response rate of 15.6%. The study found that there were no statistically significant differences between eReader users and non-users in the average amount of printed books and printed magazines consumed. However, although half of the eReader users believed their printed book reading had stayed the same after purchasing an eReader, of the 145 eReader users, 38% reported reading fewer. A similar patterns was found for magazines. The majority of respondents (86%) reported their printed magazine reading had remained the same although 10% of the eReader users indicated that they had read fewer after purchasing an eReader. The study also showed that eReader users and non-users shared similar interests in consuming media content. E-mail and news were the most consumed texts both on computer screens and eReaders by RIT faculty and staff, and there were no differences in amount of time spent on computer reading for eReader users and non-users. In addition, only 5.1% of eReader users and 1.9% of non-users in this study said they had read eBooks on computers, making the computer the least popular platform for book reading. The study revealed that eReaders were the most popular devices among eBook readers. The Amazon's Kindle and Apple's iPad ranked were the most popular brands among eReader users and potential buyers. In sum, this study showed that using an eReader device has not impacted reading behavior in the sample of respondents who were older and more educated than the general public. Other results from this study were consistent with previous studies: the younger generation was more likely to adopt an eReader than the older generation; males were more likely to purchase an eReader device than females; and eReader users were still printed media lovers.

T1  - Environmental Organizing in the Digital Age
AN  - 1520325059; 201415173
AB  - Internet technologies have impacted the form and function of social movement activities such that mainstream environmental organizations (MEO) and environmental justice organizations (EJO) have begun to adopt and use various technologies to achieve organizational goals. Given the critical role of internet technologies on social movement activity, the current project contributes to the literature on social movement activity online through a two part analysis including a mail survey and a web-based content analysis. Specifically, the digital divide is observed among EJOs and MEOs: MEOs demonstrate higher rates of adoption and more frequent use of various technologies as compared to their EJO counterparts. Most notably MEOs adopt organizational websites, use e-mail more frequently, have more technology personnel and engage in general computer use at rates higher than their EJO counterparts. Video cameras are the only technology under analysis that was adopted by EJOs at higher rates than their MEO counterparts. In terms of the purpose of use, both had attempted to solicit donations online but again, MEOs did so with greater success as compared to EJOs. Through the web-based analysis MEOs demonstrated higher complexity of their online presence as compared to EJOs with EJOs being less likely to have an online presence at all. Further, organizations with the most functional sites tended to be MEOs which hosted greater interactivity. Overall, it was clear that MEOs have established greater and more complex online presence compared to EJOs. Further studies might consider questions regarding whether these differences in use translate to higher rates of organizational goal attainment. Additionally, future studies can incorporate analyses of the nuances of mobile Internet access given the substantial growth of this means of access especially among Black and Latino users.

T1  - Digital mimesis: Epochal shifts in subjective constitution through touch-based devices
AN  - 1520315119; 201421052
AB  - This dissertation explores the question: how are touch-based devices intended to alter epochal discourses on subjective constitution and how is mimesis deployed in this pursuit? Touch-based devices are critically analyzed as being purposively aimed at affecting subjective constitution through processes of mimesis, focusing on regimes of representation and sensorial organization. Research proceeds through a history of ideas, and a two-part content analysis of touch-based devices currently in research, and public and personal use touch-based devices currently available on the market. Using formal publications by the producers of said technologies, methodologies of the sociology and history of technology are implemented to draw out an analytical schema connecting produced technological artifacts to the theoretical research on subjectivity, control, and sensorial experience. In using the term "mimesis," a lineage is traced from the classical use through the Frankfurt School analysis of Walter Benjamin and Siegfried Kracauer, to what is termed "epimimesis," or a mimesis-like quality that negates the very possibility of an original while utilizing the full corporeality of the human in epimimetic experience. Touch-based devices are examined as a fulcrum of a shift from a visual ontology to a more corporeal ontology, resulting in technological experience that deploys a mimesis-like process through a greater involvement of the entire self. Such explorations of present technological practices are conducted in the vein of Merleau-Ponty's call to reexamine our habitual backgrounds, casting a critical eye on touch-based devices as highly proliferated artifacts of the mediascape. It is found that, in the process of designing touch-based devices, producers come to imagine an "implied user" and script this into the device itself, thereby naturalizing certain ideations of the human, human nature and human ability. The language of touch and gesture is codified by device producers, ossifying a certain discourse of human ability. Actual users must then adapt to this implied user in order to properly utilize the device, thereby creating "altered users." This is of particular interest to touch-based devices, as they are often posited by producers as "natural" and "intuitive."

T1  - The coat check interactive augmented reality installation in perspective
AN  - 1505376594
AB  - Technological Displacement: The Coat Check  Interactive AR Installation in Perspective is a two-part dissertation that involves the research/creation of an augmented reality installation and a textual critique of displacement both as a socio-cultural phenomenon and a technology-driven status quo. Digital technologies involve a series of displacements from data storage and transfer to creating global networks. Going hand in hand with human mobilities technological displacement affects our lives and interactions deeply. Multimedia and digital overlaying of information and interconnectedness (mobile devices, tracking technologies, the internet...) make up our quotidian in various degrees, impelling us to be ‘present’ in time and places we actually are not. Technological displacement may be viewed as an extension of physical displacement of individuals and communities in that the need to reconcile, re-invent and innovatively market proximity becomes more and more an underlying theme of contemporary lives. Nowhere the reorientations of presence is more accentuated than ‘augmented space’, as described by Lev Manovich, “ a physical space overlaid with dynamically changing information, multimedia in form and localized for each user.”(219) It may be argued that our sense of reality is already ‘augmented’ by digital stimuli in many ways. Here I make the case that in an augmented or digitally enhanced environment we are displaced multiple times, or “multiplaced”. Augmentation is superimposing multimedia to real space, blurring the boundary between the real and the virtual, creating a heterogeneous space defined neither by the standards of the virtual nor the real but the coexistence and cooperation of both.   Augmented reality functions on the principle of multiple displacements in that real space is not a backdrop to multimedia: it is indispensable to the overall embodied experience. I created The Coat Check in 2011 using motion tracking technologies (Intersense IS900), specialized cameras (Point Grey 360° Spherical Vision Camera), screens (FogScreen), software (Max/MSP), tools and applications (Snapdragon AR). The conceptualization of The Coat Check is based on an analogy between digital technologies and coat checks that are both storage, retrieval and displacement systems. The Coat Check also raises questions on identity and history as it refers to belonging, temporality, and mobility.   This project is inspired by the work of Mona Hatoum and Kutlugˇ Ataman. Both artists’ installations focus on the dialectics of the interior and exterior, past and present, memory and amnesia. This research originates from questions of identity, mobility and memory and evolves towards an understanding of technological displacement.

T1  - Does Giving People Their Preferred Survey Mode Actually Increase Survey Participation Rates? An Experimental Examination
AN  - 1196201040
AB  - Survey research has long grappled with the concept of survey mode preference: the idea that a respondent may prefer to participate in one survey mode over another. This article experimentally examines the effect of mode preference on response, contact, and cooperation rates; mode choice; and data collection efficiency. Respondents to a 2008 telephone survey (n = 1,811; AAPOR RR3 = 38 percent) were asked their mode preference for future survey participation. These respondents were subsequently followed up in 2009 with two independent survey requests. The first follow-up survey request was another telephone survey (n = 548; AAPOR RR2 = 55.5 percent). In the second follow-up survey (n = 565; AAPOR RR2 = 46.0 percent), respondents were randomly assigned to one of four mode treatments: Web only, mail only, Web followed by mail, and mail followed by Web. We find that mode preference predicts participation in Web and phone modes, cooperation in phone mode (where contact and cooperation can be disentangled), and the selection of a mode when given the option of two modes. We find weak and mixed evidence about the relationship between mode preference and reduction of field effort. We discuss the important implications these findings have for mixed mode surveys.

T1  - Staying connected: Exploring mobile phone use amongst older adults in the UK
AN  - 1347782467; 201319812
AB  - In this paper we examine the ways in which mobile phones are becoming integrated into the everyday life of older adults in the UK by drawing on research funded as part of the British New Dynamics of Ageing programme. Specifically we draw on a digital engagement survey and the life history narratives of older men and women resident in the East Midlands of England to illuminate the challenges of remaining digitally engaged in old age focusing specifically on mobile phone use, with particular reference to maintaining social connections with spatially dispersed family and friends. Growing numbers of older adults possess a mobile phone, but the degree to which mobile phone use has been integrated into everyday practices is variable. For episodic users a mobile phone is used to complement a landline, to keep in touch with family and friends when out of the house. For confident users the mobile phone is used in multiple ways, via a range of applications, it is an integral part of numerous aspects of everyday life. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - An Evaluation of the Impact of Mobile Phones on the Socio-Educational Performance of the Students in Yazd
AN  - 1692289013; 201522249
AB  - The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of mobile phone on the socio-educational performance of the students in the city of Yazd. In order to do that, we used the theory of uses and gratification which provided a useful theoretical and explanatory tool. One of the axioms on which we can proceed to evaluate these impacts is that the mobile phone usage is one of the modern phenomena of the electronic century and digital world that has positive, negative, social and moral effects on its users. To examine such claims we used a cross sectional study that was done among 579 sample students who lived in city of Yazd as university students in 2012. The data were collected by a validated questionnaire. Based on the research results, it can be argued that although mobile phone may have negative impact on the lives of the youth, especially the students, it also has benefits including it helps them to meet their communication needs and educational needs.

T1  - Surveying Japanese Media Usage during the Beijing Olympics As a Measure of Audience Attitudes towards China and the Chinese
AN  - 1551002337; 201429498
AB  - An online survey of 624 respondents was divided evenly between men and women, with exactly 104 subjects in each of the six generational groupings. The respondents' occupational and other demographic characteristics do not deviate significantly from Japanese averages comprising a good cross-representational Japanese sample. A pre-Olympic survey was conducted on August 6-7, followed by a second survey carried out after the Olympics on September 1-2, 2008. Audience images of China and the Chinese improved as a result of exposure to media content during the Olympics period, although the improvements varied in degree somewhat depending on the issue at hand. As for reported audience attitudes towards China and the Chinese, the pre- to post-Olympic shifts were far less significant than observations of stable (i.e. apparently not significantly influenced by Olympics media coverage) attitudes/impressions in line with the audience members' individual ideological orientation. Among the ideological-type groups, those in the 'National Regime'-oriented group had more salient and robust attitudes, in general, towards many items surveyed in the research. In terms of the reported preferred media use, the audience was categorised into three groups: newspaper readers/radio listeners, television watchers/Internet users and cellular phone users. Each group displayed similar tendencies regarding the relationship of individual ideological orientation and these individuals' respective evaluations of China/Chinese.

T1  - Merging MOOC and mLearning for Increased Learner Interactions
AN  - 1364765164; 201308908
AB  - In this paper, the authors suggest the merger of the Massively Open Online Course (MOOC) format and mobile learning (mLearning) based on mutual affordances of both contemporary learning/teaching formats to investigate learner interactions and dialogues in an open online course. The paper presents a case study of how MobiMOOC, a course created using the MOOC format, demonstrates the synergistic characteristics between the MOOC format and mLearning, making a combination of both fields ideal for contemporary, digital, collaborative learning, and knowledge construction based on learner interactions and dialogue. MobiMOOC was a six-week online course focusing on mLearning that ran in April and May 2011. An end-of-course survey provides insight that supports the synergies between MOOCs and mLearning: collaboration, informal and lifelong learning, and dialogue. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Mathematics Students' Readiness for Mobile Learning
AN  - 1364763901; 201308039
AB  - Mobile learning technologies and wireless networks are being increasingly used in educational settings. Mobile learning (M-learning) through wireless technology can deliver information access to anyone any time in any place. A study was conducted to investigate the readiness of Mathematics students in Brunel University to move towards using Mobile Learning in their studies, and also to explore the factors that might affect the implementation of this technology. A total number of 82 students participated in an online questionnaire in May 2011. The questionnaire was designed in order to determine the availability of the appropriate devices, students' perceptions about M-learning and their expectations of mobile learning services. The findings of the study show that students have a positive perspective of using M-learning and they look at it as a support system for traditional class-based learning.

T1  - Assessing The M-Government Requirements In Information Stages
AN  - 1373428754; 201329421
AB  - Recently mobile phone subscribers reach the peak of 6 million people, it means that more than the whole population of the world. So this is the first manmade technology that penetrated the globe, not only in a short period of time, but also a technology that can fulfill the digital gap in the poor societies as well. As a result there is a tremendous variety of business model to lunch different value added services base on mobile phones. One of these uses of mobile phones is m-government; the governmental services which offer to citizens through mobile phones. Also there is a growing trend for implementing m-government in the both developing and developed countries. In this paper by regarding the literature, we first categorize the requirement of m-government implementation and then we assess these requirements in the 4 information stages by a panel of experts. They believe that after the information stage the role of government are becoming more and more. And the proposed requirements are expected to be fully adopted as the level of stages goes to upper levels. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Assessing The M-Government Requirements In Information Stages
AN  - 1373423762; 201322181
AB  - Recently mobile phone subscribers reach the peak of 6 million people, it means that more than the whole population of the world. So this is the first manmade technology that penetrated the globe, not only in a short period of time, but also a technology that can fulfill the digital gap in the poor societies as well. As a result there is a tremendous variety of business model to lunch different value added services base on mobile phones. One of these uses of mobile phones is m-government; the governmental services which offer to citizens through mobile phones. Also there is a growing trend for implementing m-government in the both developing and developed countries. In this paper by regarding the literature, we first categorize the requirement of m-government implementation and then we assess these requirements in the 4 information stages by a panel of experts. They believe that after the information stage the role of government are becoming more and more. And the proposed requirements are expected to be fully adopted as the level of stages goes to upper levels. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Post-Mubarak Egypt: History, Collective Memory and Memorialization
AN  - 1660019391; 201502964
AB  - History is inescapable in Egypt. Foreign tourists drawn to the abundant physical remains of Coptic, Pharaonic, Hellenic and Islamic cultures are reminded of the contemporary past as they head downtown from the Cairo airport past the triumphant October War Panorama, a 1973 war museum with fighter jets parked out front. Numerous place names - Sadat City, 26th of July Street, Talaat Harb Square, 6th of October Bridge - are constant evocations of persons and events raised to iconic status by former regimes. In the past year, a new, unsanctioned layer of historical memory has been added to Egypt's villages, towns and cities in the form of graffiti, wall art, banners and flags: artifacts of the popularly named 'January 25th Revolution.' 'Virtual' additions to the historical record, accessible via the Internet, are less visible but increasingly influential. Collected by activists, artists, scholars, journalists and ordinary people, millions of scanned photos, documents, oral histories, tweets, films, videos and audio clips portray and preserve alternative views of the tumultuous past year. Media airwaves and mobile phones convey popular revolutionary songs and video clips into remote villages. Some material is focused on remembering and honoring injured and dead civilians, while counterrevolutionary forces are fighting back with their own content. Digital technologies are now serving as platforms on which different versions of history do battle daily. Egypt is no different from other countries in which historical narratives mirror conflict and its resolution. The Mubarak regime, like those preceding it, effectively manipulated historical memory to serve its own purposes. With Mubarak's removal in February 2011, the fight over historical narratives has become more overt. It is most intense with respect to events taking place in the year since the onset of the January 25th Revolution, but it also involves efforts to rewrite Egyptian history over the past 60 years. This article addresses the following question: How have protagonists in Egypt's transition used historical narratives and memorialization to promote their diverse agendas since the fall of Mubarak? It argues that evidence of the unfinished nature of Egypt's transition is found in state efforts to control access to historical materials and in controversies about interpreting Egypt's contemporary history. It also provides examples of four different processes through which memory is created, manipulated and conveyed by ordinary people: the collection and storage of materials using digital technologies; demonstrations, marches and memorial services; the renaming of civic spaces; and artistic activism.

T1  - ONLINE HARASSMENT AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS
AN  - 1364700711; 201324672
AB  - Increased time spent online in combination with current Internet trends such as social networking have led to new risks for online harassment. This problem has been given much attention for adolescents, but little has been done to describe the risks of online harassment experienced by young adults, even though they exhibit Internet behavior comparable to adolescents. This study is in part a replication of a previous study that surveyed online harassment within a college population (Finn 2004). Three questions are addressed: (1) What is the prevalence of online harassment among undergraduate students at a large southwestern university? (2) What is the relationship between the senders and receivers of harassing communications? (3) What are the demographic and computer use variables associated with increased risk of online harassment? A cross-sectional survey was administered to a convenience sample of 420 undergraduates, and the final response rate was 81.4 percent (n = 342). Survey questions included items from the Finn (2004) study, and new questions about technological trends. The Finn study reported a 16.2 percent rate of online harassment compared to 43.3 percent in the current study. Computer use variables were significant in predicting the likelihood of being harassed online, e.g. time on social networking sites, owning an Internet connected phone, and having ever sent a text message; overall demographic variables were not significant. Online harassment is an issue deserving attention from researchers, lawmakers, parents, and university communities. Further research should investigate how students are coping with harassment, including reporting practices. Evidence-based interventions targeting this emerging issue are greatly needed.

T1  - Family members' reports of the technology use of family members with intellectual and developmental disabilities
AN  - 950864517
AB  - A nationwide survey of family members of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities ranging in age from birth through adulthood was conducted to replicate a similar effort by Wehmeyer and update the knowledge base concerning technology use by people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Survey responses provided information about use of technology for mobility, hearing and vision, communication, independent living, and in the area of computer use. In addition, survey items queried the use of electronic and information technology devices such as use of email, mobile telephones and digital cameras. Survey results showed that although the use of computers for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities is more prevalent, other technology use frequency is much the same as in the late 1990s. However, technology needs did vary among school-age individuals over time. Implications of results for technology use of people with disabilities are discussed through the lens of frequency of use and needs for individuals with disabilities.

T1  - Youthful 'fictions', creative 'journeys' and potential strategies of resistance
AN  - 1081862197; 201236073
AB  - The findings for this article emerge from data collected in June 2010, during a week-long annual workshop with three groups of 14-year-olds. Working with a central London Academy school, the project as a whole asked teenagers to 'map' their journeys through their local environment, using a range of media from static cameras to audio recorders to mobile phones and flip cameras. It asked the teenagers to reflect on those journeys through group and individual interviews and through the editing process of converting their recordings into a mini-documentary of their area. In the course of a week, each group filmed, recorded, edited and produced a 'documentary', which was then showcased to their peers. At the end of each day, the audio-visual data was uploaded to group laptops and saved, along with the interviews. Our reflections and comments were also recorded and transcribed, along with our images and recordings of the processes during the day. The initial premise for the project was to move beyond conceptions of the so-called 'digital native' and conceptions of young people per se, and investigate the more nuanced engagements with media and with local environments. Our findings raise pertinent questions around understanding, conceptualizing, and working with young people. They also suggest, contrary to discourse of the so-called 'digital-native' (see Bennett et al., 2008, for discussions of the concept, and Thornham and McFarlane, 2011: 25879), that when teenagers are given innovative and novel media, they rarely use such media in intended ways.

T1  - The usage of VoIP services and other communication services: An empirical analysis of Italian consumers
AN  - 1023028647; 201225758
AB  - This paper examines the early stages of VoIP usage by analyzing the relationship between the usage of VoIP services and other voice and non-voice communication services in Italy. In doing so, it aims at filling the gap in the empirical literature on the diffusion of VoIP among consumers and aims at investigating the relationship between VoIP adoption and the usage of telecom and Internet-related services. It relies upon a survey carried out among consumers in Italy in 2006. The use of VoIP is negatively associated with the usage of other voice communication services -- mobile communications in particular, but shows some degree of complementarity with other non-voice (Internet-based) communication services, suggesting that familiarity with the web plays a significant and positive role in explaining the adoption of VoIP applications. Furthermore, individual users' technical skills, job position and communications' habits also matter in determining the adoption of VoIP. [Copyright Elsevier Inc.]

T1  - Splintered Space: Hybrid Spaces and Differential Mobility
AN  - 918782238
AB  - Early theories of the internet imagined that individuals would begin living most of their lives online, decreasing the importance of physical mobility and urban spaces. With the development of internet-enabled mobile phones, these early predictions have been proven false. The internet has not decreased the importance of physical mobility; instead, the digital information of the internet has begun to merge with physical space, leading to new types of hybrid spaces. These hybrid spaces are becoming increasingly common, and they may change the way physical space is negotiated and understood. At this early juncture, however, it is crucial to critically examine the development of hybrid spaces and how they may lead to issues of exclusion and exacerbate issues of access. This essay takes a critical approach to the development of hybrid spaces, arguing that what is often lost in discourses about these new understandings of space are questions of who gets to experience this convergence of the digital and the physical.

T1  - Splintered Space: Hybrid Spaces and Differential Mobility
AN  - 1347782823; 201320415
AB  - Early theories of the internet imagined that individuals would begin living most of their lives online, decreasing the importance of physical mobility and urban spaces. With the development of internet-enabled mobile phones, these early predictions have been proven false. The internet has not decreased the importance of physical mobility; instead, the digital information of the internet has begun to merge with physical space, leading to new types of hybrid spaces. These hybrid spaces are becoming increasingly common, and they may change the way physical space is negotiated and understood. At this early juncture, however, it is crucial to critically examine the development of hybrid spaces and how they may lead to issues of exclusion and exacerbate issues of access. This essay takes a critical approach to the development of hybrid spaces, arguing that what is often lost in discourses about these new understandings of space are questions of who gets to experience this convergence of the digital and the physical.

T1  - Citizen Satisfaction Survey Data: A Mode Comparison of the Derived Importance-Performance Approach
AN  - 913477389
AB  - The purpose of this article is to provide evidence regarding the comparability of results provided by two survey methods -- a random phone survey and a nonrandom online survey -- using the derived importance-performance approach to examine service satisfaction data at the local level. Specifically, we measure whether nonprobability opt-in online survey results produce results that are convergent or divergent to random phone survey results. The findings show that the phone and online survey techniques yield divergent results when simple univariate statistical techniques are employed but produce similar results when the data are analyzed using the more advanced derived importance approach. Though preliminary, the findings suggest that recent advances in the analysis of satisfaction survey data might have the possibility to offset the methodological drawbacks of nonrandom survey techniques such as opt-in online questionnaires. Because of the cost and resource implications of the use of each survey technique, the results hold potentially important lessons for researchers and administrators interested in understanding the costs and benefits of using various survey methods to assess satisfaction with municipal services.

T1  - Control Space? Cinematic Representations of Surveillance Space Between Discipline and Control
AN  - 1667948615; 201511480
AB  - Recent developments in surveillance practices and their related technologies suggest that the heretofore dominant Foucauldian paradigm of discipline, with its sites of confinement in which space is 'segmented, immobile [and] frozen', may no longer be an adequate theoretical framework in which to discuss space within surveillance studies (Foucault 1995: 195). In his essay Postscript on Control Societies, Gilles Deleuze claims that these sites are in the midst of widespread breakdown, leading to a fundamental shift in the notion of space, characterised by the term 'modulation' (Deleuze 1990: 178-179). In the control model, urban surveillance can be said to be characterised by an emphasis on the use of digital surveillance practices, leading to a view of urban space and the city, as well as its inhabitants, which largely resides within a computer mainframe. This raises a question: if the surveillance carried out within this conception of urban space can be described as concentrated, hidden, passive, functional, mobile, and varied, how can these changes be communicated cinematically since there is an obvious problem of representation; when much of the surveillance technology is computer and digital in form, how does cinema make visible the potentially invisible? In considering the question of how film engages with urban space between the paradigms of discipline and control, two cinematic views of the (informational) city will be discussed by considering three scenes from Erasing David (2009) and Minority Report (2002) in order to identify some of the cinematic strategies used in communicating contemporary surveillance practices increasingly characterised as invisible and immaterial.

T1  - Conceptualizing Media Generations: The Print, Online and Individualized Generations
AN  - 1650146391; 201503222
AB  - During the 1990s news publishers established an online presence and in the 2000s they developed cross-media news work. This has resulted in changing news accessing habits, with varied magnitude among generations. This article aims to construct theoretically sound news media generations, through statistical analysis of data from a nationally representative scientific omnibus survey conducted in 2010. Firstly the article presents a descriptive and explanatory analysis of how eight generational cohorts utilize news in print and/or online and/or mobile. Secondly these findings are used for merging the generational cohorts into a conceptualization involving three media generations. The print generation (1920s- 1940s) shows high probability (70%) and scored its highest value for reading only printed newspaper (Pearson's r = .135). The online generation (1950s-1970s) shows high probability (66%) and scored highest of online only news accessing (Pearson's r = .135). The heterogeneous news usage patterns exhibited by the individualized generation (1980s-1990s) were accommodated for by two cohorts. The online cohort shows high probability for online-only news usage (60%) and a positive correlation (Pearson's r = .065). The cross-media cohort marks high probability for cross-media use (77%) and the highest value for cross-media use (Pearson's r = .141). Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Is Mobile Technology in the Classroom a Helpful Tool or a Distraction? A Report of University Students' Attitudes, Usage Practices, and Suggestions for Policies
AN  - 1520334486; 201419247
AB  - Mobile devices capable of accessing the Internet have become ubiquitous, creating both challenges for educators, as well as opportunities for students. Faculty members have various policies concerning mobile technology, ranging from laissez-faire policies in which students do as they wish, to complete bans on the use of mobile technology in the classroom. Still other instructors design learning environments integrating the usage of smart phones, tablets, or laptops. Yet, few studies have examined students' attitudes toward mobile technology usage and policies. This research describes university students' perceptions concerning mobile devices in the classroom. Based on a survey conducted at the California Polytechnic State University, the following topics are reported and discussed: 1) How do students use technology in class, including habits and web sites visited? 2) Do students experience self-reported distraction from mobile devices, laptops, and tablets? 3) What issues concerning technology and test security are students aware of? 4) What are students' perceptions of the benefits of technology? and, (5) What classroom policy suggestions do students offer? Recommendations concerning mobile technology policies in the classroom and issues for educator consideration are provided. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Controversies around the Digital Humanities: An Agenda
AN  - 1438555386; 201339977
AB  - Observations on the current stage of the Digital Humanities and their environment identify four dangers: (1) The focus on infrastructures for the Digital Humanities may obscure that research ultimately is driven by analytical methods and tools, not just by the provision of data or publishing tools. (2) Information technology can support the Humanities in many forms and national traditions. That textual analysis is much discussed right now, should not hide the view of a broader disciplinary field. (3) The mobile revolution looming may once again lead to a repetition of highly destructive processes observed at the PC and the internet revolutions. (4) The Digital Humanities may have to take a much stronger part in the development, not only the reception, of technology. A series of concrete and controversial questions, which allow the discussion of some of these trends, is derived. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Mobile device viewing behaviors of college students An investigation of how the use of mobile devices modifies television program viewing behaviors of college students
AN  - 1322721526; 201316897
AB  - Throughout the history of mobile media devices, an evolution of portable devices like the transistor radio, Walkman, CD player, and the MP3 player has changed the way users consume programming. Studies have been done about the effects of these new technologies on the way Americans consume media programming. With the development of Apple's iPod touch, consumers became able to watch televised programming on wireless web-enabled devices. This study focuses on how the use of mobile devices modify television viewing behaviors of college students. To conduct the study, 560 students at Kutztown University of Pennsylvania were asked to complete a 26-question survey inquiring about their mobile device viewing behaviors, in order to determine their reasoning behind using mobile devices to watch television programming, and their preferred viewing method. At least 63 percent of the respondents reported using a mobile device to watch television programming, 51 percent of the respondents use laptop computers, and 37 percent use a number of other devices, including the iPod, iPod Touch, MP3 player, Kindle, and Nook. Students have an increased flexibility in scheduling causing their viewing behaviors to shift from the previous year, when most of the primarily freshman sample had not yet entered college. The overall use of college students using mobile devices to consume television programming is consistent with previous studies. This study reveals that even though college students have more flexibility in their scheduling, access to video-on-demand, and a wide assortment of web-enabled mobile devices, they still prefer watching television programming on a traditional television set.

T1  - Perspective Taking, Empathy and Problem Solving in Service Failure and Recovery Efforts: The Impact on Customer Satisfaction, Loyalty and Negative Word-of-Mouth
AN  - 1322720571; 201315559
AB  - In order for organizations to grow and enhance their positioning in a competitive business landscape, senior management should focus on monitoring organizational metrics, especially those related to the organization's profitability. One of the main drivers of financial profitability for an organization is its ability to build and retain its customer base because it is more expensive to attract new customers than it is to retain current customers. Customers expect to be fairly treated and have a pleasant experience when they engage in a business related interaction with an organization. Aside from service quality, customers find service recovery to be the most important factor when making purchasing decisions. Service recovery refers to the actions that an organization takes in response to a service failure. Researchers primarily use a theoretical framework called the organizational justice theory to examine the service recovery paradigm. There are three components which make up the organizational justice theory. These components include procedural justice, distributive justice, and interactional justice. A 2 x 2 x 2 randomized between-subjects factorial experimental design was used to assess the impact a service recovery process has on customer satisfaction, loyalty, and negative word of mouth intentions. Participants played the role of the customer and were provided one of eight uniquely different variations of a fictitious scenario which provided the text of the exchange between a customer and the customer service representative during a service recovery effort. Each scenario, in the form of an online chat transcript, was used to manipulate the independent variables; perspective taking, empathy and problem solving that came in the form of a refund. Each respective scenario was followed by a thirty four item questionnaire measuring the dependent variables; satisfaction, loyalty, and negative word of mouth intentions. Basic participant demographic information (e.g. age and gender) and previous experiences with cell phone providers were also collected. Results indicated that empathy did not produce any main effects, while perspective taking had a main effect on satisfaction and loyalty, and problem solving had a main effect on each of the three dependent variables; satisfaction, loyalty and negative word of mouth intentions. A two-way interaction of perspective taking and empathy and a three-way interaction of perspective taking, empathy and problem solving did not produce any significant effects on how participants responded to satisfaction, loyalty or negative word of mouth intentions. It is unlikely that organizations can solely rely on one specific medium to manage service recovery efforts for a diverse customer base. Therefore, additional research is required to further assess the effects interactional justice and distributive justice have when different communication mediums are used. Such findings can inform how organizations manage their talent, specifically those customer facing employees who manage service recovery processes.

T1  - Control Space? Cinematic Representations of Surveillance Space Between Discipline and Control
AN  - 1314692596
AB  - Recent developments in surveillance practices and their related technologies suggest that the heretofore dominant Foucauldian paradigm of discipline, with its sites of confinement in which space is "segmented, immobile [and] frozen", may no longer be an adequate theoretical framework in which to discuss space within surveillance studies (Foucault 1995: 195). In his essay Postscript on Control Societies, Gilles Deleuze claims that these sites are in the midst of widespread breakdown, leading to a fundamental shiftin the notion of space, characterised by the term 'modulation' (Deleuze 1990: 178-179). In the control model, urban surveillance can be said to be characterised by an emphasis on the use of digital surveillance practices, leading to a view of urban space and the city, as well as its inhabitants, which largely resides within a computer mainframe. This raises a question: if the surveillance carried out within this conception of urban space can be described as concentrated, hidden, passive, functional, mobile, and varied, how can these changes be communicated cinematically since there is an obvious problem of representation; when much of the surveillance technology is computer and digital in form, how does cinema make visible the potentially invisible? In considering the question of how film engages with urban space between the paradigms of discipline and control, two cinematic views of the (informational) city will be discussed by considering three scenes from Erasing David (2009) and Minority Report (2002) in order to identify some of the cinematic strategies used in communicating contemporary surveillance practices increasingly characterised as invisible and immaterial.

T1  - Does Giving People Their Preferred Survey Mode Actually Increase Survey Participation Rates? An Experimental Examination
AN  - 1283642379; 201304265
AB  - Survey research has long grappled with the concept of survey mode preference: the idea that a respondent may prefer to participate in one survey mode over another. This article experimentally examines the effect of mode preference on response, contact, and cooperation rates; mode choice; and data collection efficiency. Respondents to a 2008 telephone survey (n = 1,811; AAPOR RR3 = 38 percent) were asked their mode preference for future survey participation. These respondents were subsequently followed up in 2009 with two independent survey requests. The first follow-up survey request was another telephone survey (n = 548; AAPOR RR2 = 55.5 percent). In the second follow-up survey (n = 565; AAPOR RR2 = 46.0 percent), respondents were randomly assigned to one of four mode treatments: Web only, mail only, Web followed by mail, and mail followed by Web. We find that mode preference predicts participation in Web and phone modes, cooperation in phone mode (where contact and cooperation can be disentangled), and the selection of a mode when given the option of two modes. We find weak and mixed evidence about the relationship between mode preference and reduction of field effort. We discuss the important implications these findings have for mixed mode surveys.

T1  - Life as art: The interplay of real and crafted identities among virtually performing musicians in second life
AN  - 1081868214; 201239875
AB  - Virtual environments enable residents to craft unique digital representations of self and to establish virtual identities that may or may not resemble physical-world identities. How might this process be different for musicians who share music as their personal product and establish regular interaction with a fan base over time? This study is presented as a co-constructed, multi-vocal narrative of the researcher's experience as Flameheart Sol, live music venue owner in Second Life, representing the interplay of real and crafted identities of 7 virtually performing musicians. Using theories of normal psychosocial development (Erikson) and subject-object orientation (Kegan), the author addresses: (a) what processes contribute to the crafting of a virtual identity and (b) how the real life of the individual changes over time through the interplay of virtual and physical identities. These questions uncover the participant's cultural footprint -- the accumulated culture and experiences that comprise the participant's identity before entering Second Life. The study then looks at the point at which an avatar representation of the participant is crafted, creating a symbolic device that enables the participant to shift from the "real" (in terms of being physical) to the "virtual" (lived experiences as an embodied avatar persona). It is through these virtually lived experiences, where the constant interaction demanded of virtual worlds creates an immediate feedback system, that an alternate, situated identity is developed. This avatar identity is no less "real" in terms of its reflecting aspects of the identity of the individual but reflects the unique affordances of a user-created space that is limited only by his or her imagination. Through personal interviews and concert observations (in both the virtual and physical worlds), it was possible not only to determine what influenced the virtual identity of the subject, but also to observe the level of "embeddedness," as described by Kegan; how emotionally invested the subjects were toward their avatar persona. This embeddedness included identity coupling, identity transparency, and shared experiences with a fan base. Subjects also experienced changes to their real lives in increased music creativity, a voice for passionate causes, and a responsive global audience that offered real income.

T1  - Citizen Satisfaction Survey Data: A Mode Comparison of the Derived Importance-Performance Approach
AN  - 1010632000; 201209663
AB  - The purpose of this article is to provide evidence regarding the comparability of results provided by two survey methods-a random phone survey and a nonrandom online survey-using the derived importance-performance approach to examine service satisfaction data at the local level. Specifically, we measure whether nonprobability opt-in online survey results produce results that are convergent or divergent to random phone survey results. The findings show that the phone and online survey techniques yield divergent results when simple univariate statistical techniques are employed but produce similar results when the data are analyzed using the more advanced derived importance approach. Though preliminary, the findings suggest that recent advances in the analysis of satisfaction survey data might have the possibility to offset the methodological drawbacks of nonrandom survey techniques such as opt-in online questionnaires. Because of the cost and resource implications of the use of each survey technique, the results hold potentially important lessons for researchers and administrators interested in understanding the costs and benefits of using various survey methods to assess satisfaction with municipal services.

T1  - POLITICAL INDIVIDUALIZATION
AN  - 1504424075; 201406181
AB  - In this paper, the authors define political individualization as a form of networked individualism. This process consists of two components: social individualization and political networking. Social individualization means that people are becoming less strongly connected to traditional communities and experiencing highly differentiated sociability. Political networking refers to the shift from stable connections to formal political movements to dynamic connections to issue networks. This article attempts to investigate whether this process of political individualization is positively related to the use of new media such as the Internet and mobile telephones. There could be two arguments why these two would be positively related. First, the use of new media drives political individualization; the use of new media stimulates individualization since it creates opportunities for individuals to create social connections outside of existing communities. New media also facilitate the formation of political networks. Second, the use of new media and political individualization are both manifestations of a broader process of societal change. The process of modernization results in increasing autonomy of individuals and growing use of technology.

T1  - POLITICAL INDIVIDUALIZATION
AN  - 1504419660; 201405511
AB  - In this paper, the authors define political individualization as a form of networked individualism. This process consists of two components: social individualization and political networking. Social individualization means that people are becoming less strongly connected to traditional communities and experiencing highly differentiated sociability. Political networking refers to the shift from stable connections to formal political movements to dynamic connections to issue networks. This article attempts to investigate whether this process of political individualization is positively related to the use of new media such as the Internet and mobile telephones. There could be two arguments why these two would be positively related. First, the use of new media drives political individualization; the use of new media stimulates individualization since it creates opportunities for individuals to create social connections outside of existing communities. New media also facilitate the formation of political networks. Second, the use of new media and political individualization are both manifestations of a broader process of societal change. The process of modernization results in increasing autonomy of individuals and growing use of technology. This paper does not test these two explanations but rather investigates whether the grounds for both arguments actually exist. The authors have formulated the following research question: Do the new media create opportunities for political individualization and how are these opportunities used? Data from an international survey (918 web questionnaires) of young people in two European cities -- Florence and Utrecht -- has been used to investigate the research question.

T1  - Using Paradata and Other Auxiliary Data to Examine Mode Switch Nonresponse in a "Recruit-and-Switch" Telephone Survey
AN  - 914766162; 201200033
AB  - Minimizing unit nonresponse and maximizing reporting accuracy about sensitive items are common goals among survey practitioners. In order to maximize reporting accuracy without compromising on response rates a common strategy is to recruit respondents over the phone and switch them to a self-administered mode (e.g., IVR, web) for answering the sensitive items. A drawback to the "recruit-and-switch" design is that a substantial portion of the sample (typically 20 percent or more) drop out during the mode switch. Recent evidence suggests that this form of nonresponse can introduce bias and offset gains in accuracy achieved by self-administration. We analyze respondents' likelihood of complying with the mode switch request in a survey of university alumni. Results indicate that paradata derived from the screening interview are related to mode switch participation. Also, we find evidence that adding reluctant sample members into the mode switch respondent pool yields improved estimates with lower nonresponse bias. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Sharing mobile phones in developing countries: Implications for the digital divide
AN  - 861622381
AB  - Current estimates of the digital divide in mobile phones between rich and poor countries are based on the ethnocentric assumption that in both regions the use of these products takes place through individual ownership. As defined by most international organizations, the digital divide in mobile phones is the ratio of subscribers in developed countries to subscribers in developing countries. This definition however assumes that the only way in which benefits accrue to individuals is by individual ownership of mobile phones. The author will argue that current measures of this divide are quite heavily overstated, in some cases to the point where the divide disappears altogether. For this purpose the author will rely mainly on household survey data that pertains to the middle of the past decade. The first part of the paper deals with the context of the digital divide and a description of the major socio-economic effects of mobile phones. The second part is concerned with the concepts and measures of sharing while the final part is concerned with empirical evidence.

T1  - A Chance to Catch a Breath: Using Mobile Video Ethnography in Cycling Research
AN  - 861239405
AB  - Under the rubric of transport much previous research on everyday mobility has focused on understanding the more representational and readily articulated aspects of everyday movement. By way of contrast, emergent theorisations of mobility suggest that an understanding of the less representational -- those fleeting, ephemeral and often embodied and sensory aspects of movement -- is vital if we are to fully understand why and how people move around. Accordingly, the ability of conventional methods to complement new research agendas, particularly those related to issues around the sensory, affect and embodied experience has been called in to question. This paper contributes to the burgeoning literature on mobile methodologies by critically discussing a theoretical and methodological journey towards mobile video ethnography in the context of a project researching cycling in London, UK between 2004 and 2006. In doing so it highlights three ways in which mobile video ethnography can contribute to research in the new mobilities paradigm: video as a way of 'feeling there' when you can't be there; video as a way of apprehending fleeting moments of mobile experience; and video as a tool to extend sensory vocabularies. It also critically discusses the limitations of video as a text and the importance of embodied experience, interpretation and audiencing to its success as part of a mobile methodology. Whilst emphasising the need for caution, the paper demonstrates the way in which mobile video ethnography can contribute to a new mobilities agenda by facilitating more situated understandings of daily corporeal mobility which highlight an alternative time-space politics to those inscribed in road spaces.

T1  - Sharing mobile phones in developing countries: Implications for the digital divide
AN  - 1010631833; 201211710
AB  - Current estimates of the digital divide in mobile phones between rich and poor countries are based on the ethnocentric assumption that in both regions the use of these products takes place through individual ownership. But while this assumption may be largely true in the former countries, it does not match the circumstances in the latter regions where a considerable amount of sharing is shown to take place (partly for cultural reasons). Using the available survey evidence and a simple arithmetic framework, I show that when sharing is taken into account, the divide entirely ceases to exist or is greatly reduced (though there are one or two exceptions to this general pattern). Improvements in data collection practice will tend, as I see it, to strengthen rather than cast doubt upon this novel finding. If so, questions arise as to the need for a gap analysis per se. As defined by most international organizations, the digital divide in mobile phones is the ratio of subscribers in developed countries to subscribers in developing countries (I use the terms owners and subscribers synonymously). This definition however assumes that the only way in which benefits accrue to individuals is by individual ownership of mobile phones. And while this may make sense in developed countries where ownership is indeed widespread, it does not make much sense in poor countries where benefits from use are more heavily derived by sharing of the technology. The problem here is created by the illegitimate transposition of an assumption from one set of circumstances to a highly different environment, a phenomenon described, among others, by Myrdal. My purpose below is to examine the implications of this assumption for the digital divide in mobile phones between rich and poor countries. In particular, I will argue that current measures of this divide are quite heavily overstated, in some cases to the point where the divide disappears altogether. For this purpose I will rely mainly on household survey data that pertains to the middle of the past decade. The first part of the paper deals with the context of the digital divide and a description of the major socio-economic effects of mobile phones. The second part is concerned with the concepts and measures of sharing while the final part is concerned with empirical evidence. Both parts 2 and 3 are based on a distinction between two major types of sharing behavior. And both parts use a measure of mobile phones per 100 inhabitants. [Copyright Elsevier Inc.]

T1  - Channel choice and public service delivery in Canada: Comparing e-government to traditional service delivery
AN  - 1030865345; 201219571
AB  - This study examines channel choice and public service delivery in Canada, comparing e-government to traditional service delivery channels such as the phone or visiting a government office. Factors studied include the digital divide, the nature of the citizen interaction with government, public service values, and satisfaction with services received by citizens. These factors are used to determine whether they impacted choice of channel and satisfaction with that channel. This study, through logistic regression of a public opinion survey of Canadian residents, found indications suggesting a digital divide in accessing e-government; found that government websites were most commonly used for information purposes, while the phone was most commonly used to solve problems. In regards to citizens' satisfaction, the apparent digital divide was bridged when females and older Canadians were more satisfied with their contact with a government website. In addition, a positive experience with service delivery and positive public service values lead to greater website satisfaction. The results of this study imply that the phone is a more effective service channel for solving problems, and the website is more effective for getting information. Therefore, governments need to provide multiple contact channels for citizens, depending upon their task at hand, while ensuring consistency of information and service response across channels. Creating a positive experience for citizens when they received a service translates into a more satisfied experience with e-government. [Copyright Elsevier Inc.]

T1  - The algorithmic turn: photosynth, augmented reality and the changing implications of the image
AN  - 902077080; 201122728
AB  - The digital turn, and with it increased use of location-aware technologies, has yielded innovative image applications and posed new questions about the status and value of the image. These applications rely on algorithmically defined relations between the viewing subject and the world viewed, offering robust alternatives to the visual economies of the past. If we take seriously Heidegger's insights regarding the Welt-bild as a metaphor for the modern era, the algorithmic reconfiguration of subject-object relations in this emerging visual regime potentially offers insights through which we can reflect upon the current era -- and a metaphoric alternative. This article uses two entry points to explore this possible reconfiguration and, with it, the question of value. Downloadable applications such as Photosynth aggregate location-tagged photographs into a near-seamless whole, and offer a way to consider such issues as collaborative authorship of the image, unstable points of view and the repositioning of subject-object relationships -- all elements that fundamentally challenge western representational norms dominant in the modern era. In this new regime, the spatial referents of greatest value are points of uniqueness sought out and built upon by the program's algorithms -- and not those perceived by the viewer. The viewer is in turn free to explore an extensive and dynamic image space unconstrained by (and, indeed, without access to) an authorised or 'correct' viewing position. A second case, built upon certain augmented reality applications, works by 'recognising' particular spaces and, through the use of computationally enhanced viewing screens, superimposing new images over real space. In this case, a system of virtual spatial annotation depends upon the 'correct' positioning of the viewer (and portable computing device) in the world. The two cases stand in a roughly reciprocal relationship, turning on different notions of algorithmic intermediation and subject-object relations and dynamics for the generation of meaning and value.

T1  - Wireless Protesters Move Around: Informational and Coordinative Use of Information and Communication Technologies for Protest Politics
AN  - 964194072; 201206852
AB  - This study explored information and communication technology (ICT) uses for protest politics, focusing on the case of a 2008 protest in Korea. Based on a survey of citizen activists (N = 322), it examined informational and coordinative uses of eight different ICTs for protest participation. The results indicated that heavy, moderate, and nonprotesters were differentiated, particularly regarding the use of Web sites of social movement organizations (SMOs), mobile phone, and e-mail. Across all types of protesters, the portal site was the most prominently utilized tool, while online micromedia showed little contribution. The findings call for the reconsideration of the waning role of SMOs in contemporary protest politics, and the differentiation of the public-oriented ICT from the private use of ICT regarding its contribution to expand civil society.

T1  - Identification with online and offline communities: Understanding ICT disparities in Finland
AN  - 907924471; 201125620
AB  - Computers, mobile phones and other information and communication technologies (ICTs) have become a major part of the everyday life in affluent societies, yet significant socio-demographic disparities remain in their use. Young adults in particular continue to be much more active users of ICTs than the older generations. In this article we explore an approach to understand the institutional implications of ICT usage disparity: the socio-psychological significance of a technology to its users. We argue that identification mediated by technology is for many purposes at least as important of a measure as the actual quantity and quality of their use for many peer groups. Analyses of a nationally representative survey sample collected in 2009 (Na=a1202) indicate that young Finns identify with online communities significantly more strongly than their elders do. Overall, however Finns identify much more with traditional offline formations. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

AN  - 862596459; 201109826
AB  - This study examined relations between a cross-cultural geographically mobile childhood & adulthood cultural homelessness, attachment to cross-cultural identities, & self esteem. Cross-cultural identities are loosely defined identities (e.g., third culture kids, military brats, missionary kids) that describe some individuals' childhood cross-cultural experience. The 475 participants spent at least two years before age 18 in a country different from their parents' home culture, then returned to the latter. They completed an online survey which included general demographic information regarding cross-cultural experiences in childhood, as well as the Cultural Homelessness Criteria, the Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale, & items that evaluated the strength of affirmation, belonging, & commitment to a self-labeled cross-cultural identity. Cultural homelessness was related to lower self esteem scores; higher affirmation, belonging & commitment to any cross-cultural identity was related to higher self esteem & lower cultural homelessness. Furthermore, such affirmation, belonging, & commitment buffered the cultural homelessness -- self esteem association, whereas just having a cross-cultural identity did not. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Formal Manifestations Of Organized Crime In Bosnia And Herzegovina
AN  - 1221408470; 201246248
AB  - In the overall context of negative social phenomena, organized crime takes a special place, given its constant presence and trend toward expansion, as well as its tendency to be expressed through new forms that are characterized by a high level of organization classification and internationalization, while, at the same time, adjusting to the socioeconomic and political relations of each country. The question of the phenomenological dimensions of organized crime, which is the subject of this article, is especially significant. The phenomenological dimension of organized crime is its organized structure of criminal behaviour, the change in that structure and the formal manifestations of organized forms. In this context, one can talk about the statics and dynamics of organized crime and the typology of its forms. One can thereby form a picture of the various forms of organized crime and try to clear up some of its criminological phenomena (in addition to its etiological and victimological phenomena). Design/Methodology/Approach: Literature review has been carried out in order to determine the structure and content of organized crime. In the process of writing this article, the author primarily used a method of content analysis that includes an analysis of available sources and reports of official authorities (domestic and international) and other relevant materials. Findings: Organized crime is a negative and harmful occurrence in all societies, including in Bosnia and Herzegovina ("BiH"). It is characterized by its ease of adaptation to socioeconomic and sociopolitical conditions, and especially its adaptation to the conditions of countries, of which BiH is one. Therefore, the article surveys organized crime in BiH, with particular reference to the characteristics and conditions of organized crime in BiH and its demonstrated forms therein. One characteristic of organized crime is that, influenced by global social changes, it has undergone significant changes. These changes indicate that some forms have been actualized, while others have just appeared. In this context, traditional activities of organized crime are observed, including: drug trafficking, trafficking in human beings, smuggling of various goods and services (arms and ammunition, artwork and other taxable goods), corrupt business enterprises, organized violent crime, etc. Newer forms of organized crime including: gambling on the Internet (online sports betting, casinos, money-laundering schemes, etc.), manipulation of stock markets (rising-falling schemes), mortgage fraud (unfair assessments, dishonest lenders, insurance fraud), credit card fraud, usurous telephone prices ("sky-high" phone bills), cyber-crime, etc. It also is important to emphasize the appearance of new ways of organizing criminal groups in so-called criminal networks as transnational criminal collectives and to point out the specific results of this form of organization and activity by criminal groups. Some of these phenomena are present in BiH, and they demand an adequate institutional and legal reaction. Global social changes that have occurred over the past twenty years have given rise to new phenomena, such as technological development, migration, the transnational transfer of capital and services, open markets, etc. Practical implications: The purpose of this article is to assess new forms of organized crime in BiH and the institutional and criminal responses to them. The results of this article may be applied in the assessment of the new forms of organized crime that have been caused by global changes and may provide institutional and criminal law proposals (de lega ferenda), which would lead to the successful prevention and combating of these forms of crime.

AN  - 1221407091; 201245807
AB  - In this article we describe new research to investigate unintended pregnancies during the transition to adulthood. The Relationship Dynamics and Social Life (RDSL) study begins with a 60-minute in-person interview about family background and current relationship characteristics. At the conclusion of the interview, respondents are enrolled in an ongoing journal, which consists of a 5-minute survey via web or phone and occurs weekly for 2.5 years. We have enrolled over 1,000 young women in the study and have experienced excellent baseline response rates and high journal participation rates. Below we describe the limitations of past research on unintended pregnancy as a background for our study. Then we provide a detailed description of the study and its design strengths and weaknesses.

T1  - Class, Cultural Capital, and the Mobile Phone
AN  - 1030866163; 201229518
AB  - This article uses data from a representative survey on the applications of information and communication technologies to investigate the use of the mobile phone as a cultural object by different groups of respondents/consumers. Setting out from the premise that the symbolic and artefactual nature of new media, their 'thingness', should be a central part of any investigation of their social and cultural significance, the article focuses on the meaning of the mobile phone as a cultural object and commodity sign for various groups of users/consumers. It also concentrates on the social structuring of mobile phone use by young people and addresses the relationship between class and the practices and meanings of mobile phone use in the context of young people's consumption of other media and cultural technologies. It addresses one of the central questions in the sociology of culture-how are consumption tastes and practices related to class-and examines it through the case of mobile phone use. The study suggests that the general 'technosensibility' of young people, which seems a universal generational phenomenon, when interpreted in the context of the consumption of other 'old' and 'new' media and cultural consumption in general, is differentiated according to class and cultural capital. The article concludes that class distinctions produce a digital divide that results in two distinct populations of young users: the interacting and the interacted users.

T1  - Understanding Citizens' Adoption of New Technologies Used in Delivery of Public Service and Information
AN  - 1018354552; 201213389
AB  - Along with the growing popularity of e-government, public agencies increasingly have technology options in providing services to citizens, including mobile phone and web-based applications, information kiosks, and smart cards among others. Whether citizens will embrace these new technologies that are used in the delivery of public service and information has been a question both in academia and practice. On the other hand, the determinants of acceptance have not been well understood. Accordingly, this study aims to answer two main research questions: 1) What are the individual, social, technological, and contextual factors that affect citizens' adoption of new technologies used in e-government context? 2) Are adoption factors similar for different technologies? The study examines citizens' adoption of three different technologies in using public transportation service. Two of these technologies, Chicago Card and Chicago Card plus, are transaction technologies in the form of a smart card. The third technology, Chicago Transit Authority website, is used both as an information and transaction technology. Using data from Chicago Transit Authority Customer Experience Survey conducted in year 2008, the study tested a model of citizens' technology adoption in e-government context. The study finds that individual characteristics such as lifestyle and intensity of public service use, technology usage context such as availability of other advantageous options and presence of incentives for technology use, and presence of facilitating conditions such as availability of resources, skills, and self-efficacy matter for citizens' technology adoption in e-government context, but the extent to which they are important may depend on the characteristics of the technologies, such as complexity, cost, features, and benefits. In addition, the findings from exploratory analyses indicate that adoption factors also differed for men and women within a single technology. Findings also imply that when public agencies offer a variety of technologies with different levels of complexity, benefits, and costs according to the characteristics of different market segments using their services, they may be in a better position to address digital disparities, and provide a more equitable distribution of benefits by including a diversity of people that can take advantage of the technology.

T1  - Social operational information, competence, and participation in online collective action
AN  - 1018338355; 201215279
AB  - Recent advances in interactive web technologies, combined with widespread broadband and mobile device adoption, have made online collective action commonplace. Millions of individuals work together to aggregate, annotate, and share digital text, audio, images, and video. Given the prevalence and importance of online collective action systems, researchers have increasingly devoted attention to questions about how individuals interact with and participate them. I investigate these questions with the understanding that an individual's behaviors and attitudes depend in part on what they know and believe about how the online collaborative system operatesathe "nuts and bolts," so to speak. In this dissertation I examine how social operational information ainformation and beliefs about the other people who act in online collective action systemsacan influence individuals' attitudes, assumptions, behaviors, and motivations with respect to those systems. I examine the role of social operational information from two distinct but related perspectives. First, I employed a social psychological laboratory study to examine the influence of a specific type of social operational information: relative competence feedback. Experimental findings demonstrate that individuals who received information that they were of low relative competence compared to others contributed less to a collective good compared to those who received either average or high relative competence feedback. Two key attitudes about abilities and responsibilities in inter-dependent situationsa self-efficacy and social responsibilityamediated the competence-contribution relationship. Furthermore, individual participants' stable preferences about the distribution of rewards for themselves and other people (social value orientation) moderated the observed changes in contribution rates across experimental conditions. Secondly, I conducted a qualitative interview study of Wikipedia's infrequent editors and readers. The study focused on documenting and understanding participants' attitudes, beliefs, and assumptions about Wikipedia's social system and the other individuals who contribute to it. Interviews focused on questions about the nature of Wikipedia and its' user-generated system, the characteristics of the people who write Wikipedia, and the motivations that encourage their participation. Qualitative analysis revealed a variety of tensions around the nature of Wikipedia as an open, user-generated system, as well as between widespread negative stereotypes of contributors as geeks, nerds, and hackers and equally prevalent positive assumptions about their pro-social motivations for contributing to Wikipedia. I argue that these tensions reveal a transition towards a view of online collaborative work as open, creative, and focused on collaboration, dominated by intrinsic motivations such as passion, interest, and a desire to contribute something to the world. This emerging view of work on Wikipedia is captured by Himanen's notion of The Hacker Ethic. Finally, I explore how qualitative and experimental findings can speak to each other, and discuss some methodological challenges and best practices for combining experimental and qualitative methods. I argue that triangulating qualitative and experimental results in the context of this study facilitates: (1) lending detail and nuance to our understanding of complex attitudes such as social responsibility, and (2) improving the ecological validity of experimental findings by vetting assumptions about competence and social roles/responsibilities in a real-world context.

T1  - Soldier Photography of Detainee Abuse in Iraq: Digital Technology, Human Rights and the Death of Baha Mousa
AN  - 817785666
AB  - Digital media technologies provide new opportunities for the recording and publicising of human rights violations. In recent years, soldier photography during military conflicts has become one of the most controversial sources of images of abuse, especially in relation to the visual representation of detainees. The backdrop to this article is the death of Baha Mousa, an Iraqi civilian who died while in detention on a British Army military base in Basra in southern Iraq in 2003. A soldier's video footage of Mr Mousa's treatment in the detention facility has helped to generate a range of cultural, political and legal effects, not least an ongoing official Inquiry into the causes of his death. But while new media technologies, such as mobile camera-phones, can provide an expanded visual record of human suffering and death in war zones, this article argues that this brings dangers as well as possibilities. More generally, it raises questions about how human rights practitioners should respond to the increasing visualisation of witnessing. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Innovation and Reduction in Contemporary Qualitative Methods: The Case of Conceptual Coupling, Activity-Type Pairs and Auto-Ethnography
AN  - 856408724; 201106458
AB  - During the course of this paper we mobilise an ideal typical framework that identifies three waves of reduction within contemporary qualitative inquiry as they relate to key aspects of the sociological tradition. The paper begins with a consideration of one of sociology's key questions; namely how is social organisation possible? The paper aims to demonstrate how this question moves from view as increased specialisation and differentiation in qualitative methodology within sociology and related disciplines results in a fragmentation and decontextualisation of social practices from social orders. Indeed, the extent to which qualitative methods have been detached from sociological principles is considered in relation to the emergence of a reductionist tendency. The paper argues that the first wave is typified by conceptual couplings such as 'discourse and the subject', 'narrative and experience', 'space and place' and the second by 'activity type couplings' such as 'walking and talking' and 'making and telling' and then, finally, the third wave exemplified through auto-ethnography and digital lifelogging. We argue each of these three waves represent a series of steps in qualitative reduction that, whilst representing innovation, need to reconnect with questions of action, order and social organisation as a complex whole as opposed to disparate parts.

T1  - Experiments in Mobile Web Survey Design: Similarities to Other Modes and Unique Considerations
AN  - 761224048
AB  - Self-administered surveys can be conducted on mobile web-capable devices, yet these devices have unique features that can affect response processes. Ninety-two adults were randomly selected and provided with mobile devices to complete weekly web surveys. Experiments were designed to address three main objectives. First, the authors test fundamental findings which have been found robust across other modes, but whose impact may be diminished in mobile web surveys (due largely to the device), by manipulating question order and scale frequencies. Second, the authors test findings from experiments in computer-administered web surveys, altering the presentation of images and the number of questions per page. Third, the authors experiment with the unique display, navigation, and input methods, through the need to scroll, the vertical versus horizontal orientation of scales, and the willingness to provide open-ended responses. Although most findings from other modes are upheld, the small screen and keyboard introduce undesirable differences in responses. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Penetration and Growth Rates of Mobile Phones in Developing Countries: An Analytical Classification
AN  - 758123775; 201059707
AB  - This brief paper uses a simple arithmetic framework to classify and explain the performance of developing countries in closing the absolute digital divide. Four categories are created on the basis of two variables, namely, the penetration and rate of growth of mobile phones. The paper answers questions such as: Which countries do well and badly on both variables? Are the countries in these categories drawn from specific regions or similar income levels or is the distribution more random? How can similar countries from the same region appear in two diametrically opposite categories? What does this imply for policy? Adapted from the source document.

T1  - IMITATING THE NATION-STATE
AN  - 751993935
AB  - This exploratory research considers the implications to actual world (AW) nations and attachments of an online virtual world (OVW) which mimics so many aspects of AW nation-states. Using Lessing's interrogation of mimesis as a framing device, this paper presents the results of a quantitative investigation that examines the relationship between the competing loyalties of AW nations and the OVW of Second Life (SL). To that end, a subsample of 212 members of SL completed an online survey which measured five aspects of the national and SL attachment, including a section in which participants ranked their concern for fellow co-nationals (CNs) versus their concern for fellow Second Lifers (SLers). Analyses of the data produced four main findings. First, 45 per cent of participants ranked their concern for their fellow SLers above that of their fellow CNs. Second, those who preferred SLers were significantly less attached to their AW nations than those who preferred CNs. Third, the SLer-preferred, on average, considered SL to be like a world, while the CN-preferred were more ambivalent in this regard. Fourth, gender differences indicate that males who preferred SLers spent most of their time in the SL engaged in activities while females who preferred SLers spent most of their time in the SL engaged in communicatory socializing. Discussion of these results focuses on notions of cosmopolitanism versus nation-statehood and uses the category of gender to illustrate the implications of mimesis to the durability of the phenomenon of nation-statehood.

T1  - Efficacy and usability of assistive technology for patients with cognitive deficits: a systematic review
AN  - 754141691; 201024931
AB  - Objective: To determine the efficacy of portable electronic aids such as personal digital assistants (PDAs), pagers or mobile phones for patients with cognitive deficits by means of a systematic review. The usability of these aids is also briefly discussed.Data sources: PubMed, CINAHL, PsychINFO, EMBASE and MEDLINE were searched up to February 2009. The references of identified and relevant articles were scanned to find additional relevant titles.Review methods: Papers referring to 'electronic aids', 'cognition' and 'brain injury' were included. The population had to be adult and have cognitive impairments as a result of acquired brain injury. Outcome measures were change in cognitive or occupational performance or the level of participation in daily life. The criteria of Cicerone et al. were used to evaluate the quality of the retrieved studies.Results: Twenty-eight papers presenting 25 studies were reviewed. The total number of participants was 423. Most identified papers described case reports or non-randomized clinical trials. Only one randomized controlled trial was identified, in which the NeuroPage proved effective in supporting prospective memory. Other kinds of assistive technology such as PDAs and voice recorders showed positive results in supporting retrospective and prospective memory.Conclusion: The efficacy of assistive technology in general is not yet sufficiently studied in randomized controlled trials, although promising results has been reported. Furthermore, several survey studies established that both potential users and clinicians have optimistic expectations about the usability of assistive technology.

T1  - Experiments in Mobile Web Survey Design
AN  - 754042626; 201052759
AB  - Self-administered surveys can be conducted on mobile web-capable devices, yet these devices have unique features that can affect response processes. Ninety-two adults were randomly selected and provided with mobile devices to complete weekly web surveys. Experiments were designed to address three main objectives. First, the authors test fundamental findings which have been found robust across other modes, but whose impact may be diminished in mobile web surveys (due largely to the device), by manipulating question order and scale frequencies. Second, the authors test findings from experiments in computer-administered web surveys, altering the presentation of images and the number of questions per page. Third, the authors experiment with the unique display, navigation, and input methods, through the need to scroll, the vertical versus horizontal orientation of scales, and the willingness to provide open-ended responses. Although most findings from other modes are upheld, the small screen and keyboard introduce undesirable differences in responses.

T1  - Values as a Predictor of Cyber-bullying Among Secondary School Students
AN  - 754039703; 201052225
AB  - The use of new technologies such internet (e-mail, chat rooms) and cell phones has steeply increased in recent years. Especially among children and young people, use of technological tools and equipments is widespread. Although many teachers and administrators now recognize the problem of school bullying, few are aware that students are being harassed through electronic communication. Referred to as electronic bullying, cyber bullying, or online social cruelty, this phenomenon includes bullying through email, instant messaging, in a chat room, on a website, or through digital messages or images sent to a cell phone. Cyber bullying is defined as causing deliberate/intentional harm to others using internet or other digital technologies. It has a quantitative research design and uses relational survey as its method. The participants consisted of 300 secondary school students in the city of Konya, Turkey. 195 (64.8%) participants were female and 105 (35.2%) were male. 39 (13%) students were at grade 1, 187 (62.1%) were at grade 2 and 74 (24.6%) were at grade 3. The "Cyber Bullying Question List" developed by Aricak (2009) was given to students. Following questions about demographics, a functional definition of cyber bullying was provided. In order to specify students' human values, "Human Values Scale (HVS)" developed by Dilmac (2007) for secondary school students was administered. The scale consists of 42 items in six dimensions. Data analysis was conducted by the primary investigator of the study using SPSS 14.00 statistical analysis software. Descriptive statistics were calculated for the analysis of students cyber bullying behaviour and simple regression analysis was conducted in order to test whether each value in the scale could explain cyber bullying behaviour.

T1  - Web Surveys in the Social Sciences: An Overview
AN  - 791711756
AB  - Sample surveys are a valuable source of information about populations. The choice of data collection method depends upon the topic covered and the population observed, and the quality of data yielded may be affected by wide-ranging criteria, including sample representativeness, response rate, question comprehension and sincerity of responses. Survey methodology must therefore integrate constraints - which vary according to the data collection mode - while adapting constantly to make the most of available technology. Thirty years ago, postal surveys and face-to-face surveys conducted by an interviewer were joined by telephone surveys, whose advantages and disadvantages have been described in detail by Benoît Riandey and Jean-Marie Firdion in Population (1993, vol. 5). Since then, the growing problem of ex-directory numbers and the popularity of mobile phones have prompted the need for further adaptations. The increase in Internet access has led to the recent emergence of new survey methods, bringing in their wake new opportunities but also new dangers. Based on a review of the literature, Didier FRIPPIAT and Nicolas MARQUIS assess the strengths and weaknesses of this latest data collection mode. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Mobility is changing the ways people routinely behave in public places. Since the appearance of digital mobile phone networks, mobile phones have become part of suburban and urban landscapes globally. Both the use of public transport and mobile telecommunications are integral for daily life and self-presentation in most large cities such as London and Tokyo. Public places and spaces are being transformed into hybrid geographies through the introduction of new spatial infrastructure. In this paper, we present our analysis of the responses of our survey sample of commuters concerning their use of mobile phones on trains. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Soldier Photography of Detainee Abuse in Iraq: Digital Technology, Human Rights and the Death of Baha Mousa
AN  - 853232837; 201103910
AB  - Digital media technologies provide new opportunities for the recording and publicising of human rights violations. In recent years, soldier photography during military conflicts has become one of the most controversial sources of images of abuse, especially in relation to the visual representation of detainees. The backdrop to this article is the death of Baha Mousa, an Iraqi civilian who died while in detention on a British Army military base in Basra in southern Iraq in 2003. A soldiers video footage of Mr Mousas treatment in the detention facility has helped to generate a range of cultural, political and legal effects, not least an ongoing official Inquiry into the causes of his death. But while new media technologies, such as mobile camera-phones, can provide an expanded visual record of human suffering and death in war zones, this article argues that this brings dangers as well as possibilities. More generally, it raises questions about how human rights practitioners should respond to the increasing visualisation of witnessing. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Web Surveys in the Social Sciences: An Overview
AN  - 852899794; 201104845
AB  - Sample surveys are a valuable source of information about populations. The choice of data collection method depends upon the topic covered and the population observed, and the quality of data yielded may be affected by wide-ranging criteria, including sample representativeness, response rate, question comprehension and sincerity of responses. Survey methodology must therefore integrate constraints - which vary according to the data collection mode - while adapting constantly to make the most of available technology. Thirty years ago, postal surveys and face-to-face surveys conducted by an interviewer were joined by telephone surveys, whose advantages and disadvantages have been described in detail by Benoit Riandey and Jean-Marie Firdion in Population (1993, vol. 5). Since then, the growing problem of ex-directory numbers and the popularity of mobile phones have prompted the need for further adaptations. The increase in Internet access has led to the recent emergence of new survey methods, bringing in their wake new opportunities but also new dangers. Based on a review of the literature, Didier FRIPPIAT and Nicolas MARQUIS assess the strengths and weaknesses of this latest data collection mode. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Quantitative Surveys in Hard-to-Reach Populations: The Experience of the 'Observatoire francais des drogues et des toxicomanies'
AN  - 822519572; 201067995
AB  - This article presents a research device (drawn up by the 'Observatoire francais des drogues et des toxicomanies' or OFDT) for exploring drug consumption practices among 'hard-to-reach users'. The OFDT's aim is to put forward a coherent and precise understanding of phenomena relating to drug use and to monitor developments from a national perspective, despite regional differences. The scope of observation focusses on the primary areas of drug use in France. The analysis over time of quantitative and qualitative data also made it possible to divide up the theoretical and heterogeneous unit formed by drug users (DUs) in terms of population types and sub-populations. They have different characteristics and engage in different practices, which do not always develop in the same way. Sometimes they are geographically unstable. The OFDT's experience of probability studies on DUs or populations with a high prevalence of drug use is applied in a 'capture-recapture' study that aims at estimating the prevalence of problematic drug use in six French cities and a quantitative survey based on a sampling plan with an ethnographically based approach in party environments with a focus on electronic music. These complex sampling studies prove indispensable, in particular in measuring the prevalence of drug use in populations not exclusively made up of drug users. However, we believe that, on their own, they cannot measure a phenomenon or monitor its developments since there are several sources of bias associated with sampling and the collection of data in surveys on hard-to-reach populations. We believe that comparing their results not only with the quantitative data from other sources, in particular the time series collected from users of centres for DUs but also with ethnographic data is indispensable in order to monitor these trends.

T1  - No place to call home: Cultural homelessness, self-esteem and cross-cultural identities
AN  - 743063688; 201047242
AB  - The study examined relations between a cross-cultural geographically mobile childhood and adult cultural identity, attachment to cross-cultural identities (CCIs) and self-esteem. CCIs are loosely defined identities (e.g., third culture kids [TCKs], military brats, missionary kids) that describe some individuals' childhood cross-cultural experience. The 475 participants spent at least two years before age 18 in a culture different from their parents' and completed an online survey including childhood cross-cultural experiences, Cultural Homelessness Criteria, Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale, and Self Label Identity Measure (SLIM) that captured strength of affirmation, belonging and commitment to any CCI. Cultural homelessness (CH) was related to lower self-esteem; higher SLIM scores was related to higher self-esteem and lower CH. TCKs reported lower self-esteem than non-TCKs and older participants experienced less CH and higher self-esteem. SLIM scores buffered the CH-self-esteem relationship, whereas a TCK CCI and having more cross-culturally experienced social networks did not.

T1  - iPod people: Experiencing music with new music technology
AN  - 743061062; 201046481
AB  - The decade of the 2000s has witnessed the rise of the iPod, a well-marketed mp3 player whose massive storage capacity and ever-shrinking size has extended the boundaries of personal music players to previously unthinkable proportions. And as digital music has expanded its own boundaries, it has spilled over several others, allowing us the opportunity to reconsider many of our musical assumptions. Specifically, I examine the iPod in relation to production and marketing techniques, human-technological hybridity, music hermeneutics, genre distinctions, male music collecting stereotypes, and the urban experience in New York City. The major assumption from which this work proceeds is that the iPod's relationship to culture is dynamic; the iPod doesn't wholly shape culture, nor is it wholly shaped by culture. Rather, each influences and alters the other, as culture and product evolve alongside one another. The primary theme that runs through this study is the listener's relationship to a listening device. How does a music medium affect the way we hear music, and how do our listening habits dictate the functions of an mp3 player? By keeping these questions in the foreground, I privilege contemporary listening habits in order to best understand not only the iPod, but also broader popular music culture in the early twenty-first century.

T1  - The Mobile Internet Use in Japan: Cyber-bullying through Mobile Phones
AN  - 743044224; 2010S01191
AB  - Cyber-bullying is one of the most remarkable problems of the digital age. In this paper we want to describe current trends of cyber-bullying among Japanese schoolchildren based on the survey our research team exercised on 2008 - 2009 in Gunma & Saitama prefecture. The outstanding property of Japanese cyber-bullying is that it is exercised not through PCs but through mobile phones. In Japan it is quite common among teenagers that they use the internet through their mobile phones, & at the same time, they are exposed to various kinds of net business ads & seduced to spend their time and money for SNSs or on-line games. Accessed not from PCs in their living room but from their mobile phones in their own rooms or on the streets, digital troubles including cyber-bullying, defaming or incitement to some other illegal activities are very difficult to find out for the teachers or the parents in Japan. We want to describe what Japanese teachers or parents suffer from & what Japanese schools or citizens do in order to protect the schoolchildren from these cyber troubles.

T1  - The way we are now
AN  - 60358332; 201016810
AB  - 'The way we are now' is an innovative photo-ethnographic project. It originates from both practice led research into creativity, technology and embodied mind funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, and research into well-being, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council. The research into creativity is underpinned by the writings of Merleau-Ponty, including his claim 'that modes of thought correspond to technical methods', and that to use Goethe's phrase 'what is inside is also outside', a position similar to that taken by social anthropologists seeing technology as skilled practice. The research into activity and well-being in daily life uses the experience sampling method (ESM). Traditionally, the method uses questionnaire diaries and electronic pagers which are pre-programmed to bleep at randomly selected times during the day to indicate response times. The research discussed here uses a mobile phone to indicate responses eight times a day for seven consecutive days, extended to include images taken at each signal with the mobile phone/camera, which has not been done before. The research extends both the subject matter of digital fine art, and the portrayal of subjective well-being and quality of life. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The effects of mobile technology on work-life outcomes
AN  - 1018361170; 201221187
AB  - Advances in information and communication technologies have made it increasingly easy for individuals to remain connected to their organizations. Part of this change may be due to the advent of mobile communication technologies such as smart phones (e.g., BlackBerry, iPhone, Palm Treo) that have revolutionized when and where individuals are able to perform their work. Past research concerning the effects of mobile technology in the workplace has been both optimistic and pessimistic, suggesting that mobile technology results in increased autonomy, work functioning, and work-schedule flexibility, while at the same time resulting in negative consequences such as increased work-life conflict, role overload, and an invasion of workers' sense of personal mastery. The current study presents a model examining the effects of mobile connectivity on work-life outcomes during non-working hours. The present study tests a series of direct, mediating, and moderating models that influence the relationship between mobile connectivity and stress, psychological well-being, job satisfaction, and life satisfaction. Specifically, work-life conflict was hypothesized to mediate the relationship between mobile connectivity and each of the work-life outcome variables, while boundary management strategy, psychological detachment from work, job involvement, and job control were included as moderating variables that influence the strength and direction of the relationship between mobile connectivity and each of the work-life outcomes. Participants in the study included 311 individuals collected through a web-based survey among users of mobile technologies. Results indicate that mobile connectivity was positively related to stress and work-life conflict, while negatively related to psychological well-being. Furthermore, results from the mediated analyses suggest that work-life conflict acted as a significant mediator between mobile connectivity and stress, psychological well-being, and job satisfaction. The present study's findings suggest that mobile connectivity is impacting work-life outcomes in more negative than positive ways. Because mobile technologies are changing the ways in which we stay connected to work while during non-working hours, it is important to understand how mobile technology affect outcomes related to an employee's work and non-work lives. Implications for both employees and employers are discussed with particular emphasis on the changing nature of technology.

T1  - Between Narrative and Number: The Case of ARUP's 3D Digital City Model
AN  - 61756533; 200937333
AB  - This article explores the ways in which contemporary digital visualization technologies offer grounds for a reappraisal of the relationship between qualitative and quantitative data. Using the example of a 3D digital model of the city of Manchester, the question of descriptive adequacy in the social sciences is addressed. The model is an interesting descriptive device oriented simultaneously to providing an accurate account of what is present in the world and a persuasive image of what that world could become. The analysis asks what kind of descriptive device the 3D model is, and looks at how it exercises its persuasive effects. While attending to how diverse knowledge forms are rendered compatible in the model, the concept of 'discontinuous data' is introduced to draw attention to incompatible knowledges that do not appear in the model. The article explores the potential of such models to reconfigure discontinuous data forms and to produce provocative counter-maps.

T1  - A Study in Developing a Mobile Learning System Based on Human-Computer Interaction Design Principles
AN  - 1558989022; 201432052
AB  - Today, the learning model of a single instructor interacting with many students that is applied in conventional classrooms forms a passive bottleneck. Moreover, the instructor cannot effectively record students' individual learning histories for instantaneous and suitable feedback. To address these issues using a mobile learning system (MLS) the authors have applied the principles of human-computer interaction (HCI) to construct a usable MLS on a personal digital assistant (PDA) The research focuses on adaptive content delivery within the context of small-screen design. The authors utilized task analysis, a literature review, experimental design and approaches to small-screen design, and addressed potential issues with presentation in order to design a friendly PDA interface whose performance was analyzed with a post-experiment user satisfaction questionnaire. The results of this experiment show that the mobile-based classroom learning experience provides appropriate mobile tools to help students to become capable, self-reliant, self-motivated and independent. The findings also demonstrate that variations among students' preference for content are associated with differences in the display presentation mode, and that the landscape interface is recommended for use in some contexts.

T1  - The Coverage Bias of Mobile Web Surveys Across European Countries
AN  - 743047278; 201027538
AB  - In recent years, mobile devices are increasingly considered to access the World Wide Web. Several survey research organizations are about to use this technology as a means of conducting self-administered surveys. Among other advantages it allows survey researchers to overcome the lack of random selection procedures in online surveys since it provides the opportunity to use RDD-like probability sampling of cell phone numbers. However, low penetration rates of smart phones raise concerns that the coverage bias of a mobile Web survey might in fact harm survey estimates considerably. In this paper, we report results of a simulation study on the coverage bias of the mobile Web population across European countries. Based on a subset of the Eurobarometer data we estimate the relative coverage bias of the smart phone population in contrast to the general population. Even though we observed an incline of the mobile Web penetration rates over the course of the past years, coverage biases were still considerably large for socio-demographic variables. Nevertheless, in a few European countries mobile Web coverage biases are already smaller than the coverage biases of the population with traditional landline Internet access.

T1  - Information Quality Assessment and Source Selection on the Internet for Competitive Intelligence: Fieldwork Research on 53 Executives
AN  - 743047159; 201032559
AB  - The internet is seen as a challenging workspace for Corporate Communication & Information Management purposes. It enables a growing number of people to publish, share & relay information on any subject. The recent emergence of user-friendly content creation tools & networking facilities has increased that phenomenon & brought new settings to the informational landscape of organizations. We argue that the evolution of internet has created new needs in practices & theoretical understanding of information quality assessment & source selection. Based on a survey of corporate information specialists in the private sector in Belgium, the study examines the perceived shift of information quality assessment criteria when dealing with online sources. This paper aims to present a conciliation of usual information evaluation criteria to five formats of information sources, considered as specific to what people call Web 2.0: weblogs, wikis, podcasts, file sharing platforms & social networks sites. 53 phone interviews were conducted in 2008. Results confirms the existence of a perceived shift in the information quality assessment process. They suggests that it remains globally the same, but that it mostly needs to be adapted to better cope with the new reality of sources formats. Nuances to this observation are discussed in this paper. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Tele-Technologies, Control, and Sousveillance: Saddam Hussein -- De-Deification and the Beast
AN  - 61721237; 200911698
AB  - This paper examines two disturbing, post-2003 Iraq War representations of Saddam Hussein -- the televised inspection of his disheveled body on his capture (December 2003) and television and internet footage of his execution (December 2006). These representations epitomize two very different examples of government control of information within the emergent tele-technological environment of Web 2.0. The portrayal of Saddam Hussein as a captured beast was controlled by the U.S. military, while sanitized footage of his execution was staged by the Iraqi government and intended to demonstrate that Saddam Hussein died "like all tyrants, frightened and terrified" (in the words of the Iraqi Prime Minister). While both official images intended to draw a line under the continued insurgencies in Iraq by depriving insurgents of their leader-in-hiding and leader-under-trial, the official version of his death was subverted through the distribution of illegally captured mobile phone video footage, which was subsequently retransmitted in mainstream news media. This raises questions about the nature and limits of strategic political communication in the context of Web 2.0 technologies where shocking but popular "sousveillant" content can reframe the ethical boundaries of mainstream news.

T1  - Social context and communication channels choice among adolescents
AN  - 61703695; 200913515
AB  - As online communication is more and more integrated in everyday life to support and maintain existing social ties, this study examined the factors associated with preference of face to face, phone or online conversations, A contextual framework that emphasizes the role of relationship origin, relationship intensity and content of communication on communication channel choice among adolescents was empirically tested. Based on a nationwide survey in Israel, it was found that communication content, relationship origin and place of residence affect the preference of face to face and online communication. Phone communication appears to be a more non specific channel to conduct personal and non personal conversations and relationship origin did not affect its use. These findings suggest that relationship origin is important, and face to face communication is preferred for ties that were initiated face to face and online communication for ties that were initiated online. For this sample of regular population, there is no indication that online communication tends to be personal or hyper personal. The use of all the communication channels is preferred to the maintenance of existing ties and is less used for the creation of new ties. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Improved Self-exclusion Program: Preliminary Results
AN  - 198748526; 18815871
AB  - The gambling industry has offered self-exclusion programs for quite a long time. Such measures are designed to limit access to gaming opportunities and provide problem gamblers with the help they need to cease or limit their gambling behaviour. However, few studies have empirically evaluated these programs. This study has three objectives: (1) to observe the participation in an improved self-exclusion program that includes an initial voluntary evaluation, phone support, and a mandatory meeting, (2) to evaluate satisfaction and usefulness of this service as perceived by self-excluders, (3) to measure the preliminary impact of this improved program. One hundred sixteen self-excluders completed a questionnaire about their satisfaction and their perception of the usefulness during the mandatory meeting. Among those participants, 39 attended an initial meeting. Comparisons between data collected at the initial meeting and data taken at the final meeting were made for those 39 participants. Data showed that gamblers chose the improved self-exclusion program 75% of the time; 25% preferred to sign a regular self-exclusion contract. Among those who chose the improved service, 40% wanted an initial voluntary evaluation and 37% of these individuals actually attended that meeting. Seventy percent of gamblers came to the mandatory meeting, which was a required condition to end their self-exclusion. The majority of participants were satisfied with the improved self-exclusion service and perceived it as useful. Major improvements were observed between the final and the initial evaluation on time and money spent, consequences of gambling, DSM-IV score, and psychological distress. The applicability of an improved self-exclusion program is discussed and, as shown in our study, the inclusion of a final mandatory meeting might not be so repulsive for self-excluders. Future research directives are also proposed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Evaluating latecomer growth in information technology: A historical perspective
AN  - 61779162; 200901543
AB  - From a low initial base it is not difficult for developing countries to close the relative digital divide with the developed countries. A more challenging and novel question is whether, because of leapfrogging and other latecomer advantages, developing countries have grown faster than developed from the same initial starting point. Or, is it the case rather that the disadvantages of being a latecomer exceed the advantages? Are there any pronounced outliers among the developing countries and what are their distinguishing characteristics? Using a number of methods and data sources I seek to answer these questions in a tentative but provocative manner. [Copyright 2008 Elsevier Inc.]

T1  - Mediations techniques des interactions perceptives: rencontres tactiles dans les environnements numeriques partages
AN  - 61710012; 200833576
AB  - In what conditions does a technical mediation allow subjects to meet and to recognize each other? In digital networks, virtual spaces of collaborative work and play give rise to interactions at a distance between users. But to what extent do these interactions allow each partner to recognize the living presence of other perceiving subjects? In order to study this question, we use perceptual supplementation devices (more commonly known as sensory substitution systems). These devices for prosthetic perception represent an extreme situation, which is highly revealing as to the way that technological devices transform our perceptual capacities. Here, they make it possible to identify the conditions for the existence of perceptual crossing, i.e. a situation which makes it possible for two subjects to recognize each other. To carry out this research, we propose a minimalist experimental paradigm, constructed with the aid of the 'Tactos' system. This perceptual supplementation device has been developed in order to give a tactile perception of digital forms present on the screen of a computer. When two such devices are connected in a network, they also allow tactile interactions between users at a distance (one can speak of distal caresses). The minimal version of this device gives scope for an experimental study and a precise analysis of the perceptual interactions. These experiments lead us to suggest several conditions which seem necessary for the constitution of a lived experience of perceptual crossing: the presence for each partner of a body-image perceivable by the other participants; a direct link between the perceptual activity and the dynamics of this body-image; and the impossibility for each partner to themselves perceive the body-image they present to the other participants.

T1  - Médiations techniques des interactions perceptives: rencontres tactiles dans les environnements numériques partagés: Information sur les Sciences Sociales
AN  - 1928680546
AB  - Dans quelles conditions une médiation technique permet-elle à des sujets de se rencontrer et de se reconnaître? Dans les réseaux numériques, les espaces virtuels de travail collaboratif et de jeu donnent lieu à des interactions entre des utilisateurs distants. Mais dans quelle mesure ces interactions permettent-elles à chacun de reconnaître la présence d'autres sujets percevants? Pour étudier cette question nous utilisons des dispositifs de suppléance perceptive (systèmes de substitution sensorielle). En effet, ces prothèses perceptives représentent une situation extrême, bien révélatrice de la façon dont les technologies transforment nos capacités perceptives. Ici, elles permettent l'étude des conditions d'existence du croisement perceptif, c'est-à-dire d'une situation qui donne aux sujets la possibilité de se reconnaître mutuellement. Pour mener cette recherche nous proposons un paradigme expérimental minimaliste construit à l'aide du système `Tactos'. Ce dispositif de suppléance perceptive a été développé pour donner une perception tactile des formes numériques présentes sur l'écran de l'ordinateur. La mise en réseau de dispositifs de ce type permet aussi des interactions tactiles entre des utilisateurs distants (on parle de caresses distales). La version minimale de ce dispositif permet une étude expérimentale et une analyse précise des interactions perceptives. Ces expériences nous conduisent à suggérer quelques conditions nécessaires pour la constitution de l'expérience vécue de croisements perceptifs: la présence pour chacun d'un corps-image perceptible par les autres utilisateurs; un lien direct entre l'activité perceptive et la dynamique de ce corps-image; et l'absence de perception par chacun du corps-image qu'il présente aux autres utilisateurs.  
 In what conditions does a technical mediation allow subjects to meet and to recognize each other? In digital networks, virtual spaces of collaborative work and play give rise to interactions at a distance between users. But to what extent do these interactions allow each partner to recognize the living presence of other perceiving subjects? In order to study this question, we use perceptual supplementation devices (more commonly known as sensory substitution systems). These devices for prosthetic perception represent an extreme situation, which is highly revealing as to the way that technological devices transform our perceptual capacities. Here, they make it possible to identify the conditions for the existence of perceptual crossing, i.e. a situation which makes it possible for two subjects to recognize each other. To carry out this research, we propose a minimalist experimental paradigm, constructed with the aid of the `Tactos' system. This perceptual supplementation device has been developed in order to give a tactile perception of digital forms present on the screen of a computer. When two such devices are connected in a network, they also allow tactile interactions between users at a distance (one can speak of distal caresses). The minimal version of this device gives scope for an experimental study and a precise analysis of the perceptual interactions. These experiments lead us to suggest several conditions which seem necessary for the constitution of a lived experience of perceptual crossing: the presence for each partner of a body-image perceivable by the other participants; a direct link between the perceptual activity and the dynamics of this body-image; and the impossibility for each partner to themselves perceive the body-image they present to the other participants.

T1  - Survey response rate levels and trends in organizational research
AN  - 61686976; 200900655
AB  - This study examines the response rates for surveys used in organizational research. We analysed 1607 studies published in the years 2000 and 2005 in 17 refereed academic journals, and we identified 490 different studies that utilized surveys. We examined the response rates in these studies, which covered more than 100,000 organizations and 400,000 individual respondents. The average response rate for studies that utilized data collected from individuals was 52.7 percent with a standard deviation of 20.4, while the average response rate for studies that utilized data collected from organizations was 35.7 percent with a standard deviation of 18.8. Key insights from further analysis include relative stability in response rates in the past decade and higher response rates for journals published in the USA. The use of incentives was not found to be related to response rates and, for studies of organizations, the use of reminders was associated with lower response rates. Also, electronic data collection efforts (e.g. email, phone, web) resulted in response rates as high as or higher than traditional mail methodology. We discuss a number of implications and recommendations. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright 2008 The Tavistock Institute.]

T1  - Prenotification in Web-Based Access Panel Surveys: The Influence of Mobile Text Messaging Versus E-Mail on Response Rates and Sample Composition
AN  - 61681462; 200828328
AB  - To compare the effectiveness of different prenotification and invitation procedures in a web-based three-wave access panel survey over 3 consecutive months, we experimentally varied the contact mode in a fully crossed two-factorial design with (a) three different prenotification conditions (mobile short messaging service [SMS], e-mail, no prenotice) and (b) two "invitation and reminder" conditions (SMS, e-mail). A group with nearly complete mobile phone coverage was randomly assigned to one of these six experimental conditions. As expected, SMS prenotifications outperformed e-mail prenotifications in terms of response rates across all three waves. Furthermore, e-mail invitation response rates outperformed those for SMS invitations. The combination of SMS prenotification and e-mail invitation performed best. The different experimental treatments did not have an effect on the sample composition of respondents between groups. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2008.]

T1  - ReacTickles Global: Can mobile technologies encourage playful social interaction?
AN  - 1012113282
AB  - This report describes the early design stages of ReacTickles Global, a new phase of the Reactive Colours project that is being developed collaboratively with designers from the Welsh Institute of Research in Art and Design (WIRAD), end users and an advisory panel from a range of related disciplines. The broad aim of ReacTickles Global is to explore how the inherent connectivity of mobile and web technologies can be exploited to encourage playfulness, creativity and social communication. The proposed target population is people with learning disabilities who might be disadvantaged at having to use traditional text-based formats in order to master mobile communication and to enjoy social networks. The project will draw upon the experiences and outcomes of Reactive Colours, which developed on the basis of a flexible and agile design methodology that included the ideas and experiences of the target population throughout the design process. At an appropriate stage evaluation will consider whether playful social interaction with ReacTickles Global has the potential to enable learning that is both socially constructed and collaborative.

T1  - Reorienting the mobile: Australasian imaginaries
AN  - 61727224; 200911722
AB  - In this paper, I approach the question of mobiles in Asian countries by considering the case of Australia. I do so by way of a preliminary inquiry that seeks to explore the intersection between the emergence of mobiles in Australia with transformations in that country's sense of its relationship with Asia. First, I discuss the history of the mobile phone in Australia, noting some important uses and representations that formed part of its social shaping. Second, I explore mobiles and the paradoxes of multiculturalism, and also how digital technologies became central to political culture and identity debates in Australia in the early to-mid 1990s. Third, I look at some important moments in the social shaping of text messaging, in which questions of cultural difference were decisive. Finally, I offer concluding remarks about future research on mobiles in Australia and how they are tied into Asian identities. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - iCrime Wave
AN  - 224030815
AB  - The iPod's distinctive white earbuds have become a cultural icon. In 2005, the year sales of iPods skyrocketed, incidents of violent crime in the US increased for the first time in more than a decade. In Britain, officials now believe a surge in robberies in 2005 -- including a 42% increase in crime on London's Underground -- is linked in part to iPods. Crime waves have coincided with the proliferation of expensive Nike sneakers and North Face jackets. Which raises the question of whether the iCrime wave might have been foreseen, or even prevented. Some law enforcement officials think they have identified the next potential target: T-Mobile's Sidekick.
