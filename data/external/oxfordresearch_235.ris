AB  - Background: Sugarcane cultivars are polyploid interspecific hybrids of giant genomes, typically with 10-13 sets of chromosomes from 2 Saccharum species. The ploidy, hybridity, and size of the genome, estimated to have >10 Gb, pose a challenge for sequencing. Results: Here we present a gene space assembly of SP80-3280, including 373,869 putative genes and their potential regulatory regions. The alignment of single-copy genes in diploid grasses to the putative genes indicates that we could resolve 2-6 (up to 15) putative homo(eo)logs that are 99.1% identical within their coding sequences. Dissimilarities increase in their regulatory regions, and gene promoter analysis shows differences in regulatory elements within gene families that are expressed in a species-specific manner. We exemplify these differences for sucrose synthase (SuSy) and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), 2 gene families central to carbon partitioning. SP80-3280 has particular regulatory elements involved in sucrose synthesis not found in the ancestor Saccharum spontaneum. PAL regulatory elements are found in co-expressed genes related to fiber synthesis within gene networks defined during plant growth and maturation. Comparison with sorghum reveals predominantly bi-allelic variations in sugarcane, consistent with the formation of 2 "subgenomes" after their divergence ∼3.8-4.6 million years ago and reveals single-nucleotide variants that may underlie their differences. Conclusions: This assembly represents a large step towards a whole-genome assembly of a commercial sugarcane cultivar. It includes a rich diversity of genes and homo(eo)logous resolution for a representative fraction of the gene space, relevant to improve biomass and food production.

AB  - Background: The German Shepherd Dog (GSD) is one of the most common breeds on earth and has been bred for its utility and intelligence. It is often first choice for police and military work, as well as protection, disability assistance, and search-and-rescue. Yet, GSDs are well known to be susceptible to a range of genetic diseases that can interfere with their training. Such diseases are of particular concern when they occur later in life, and fully trained animals are not able to continue their duties. Findings: Here, we provide the draft genome sequence of a healthy German Shepherd female as a reference for future disease and evolutionary studies. We generated this improved canid reference genome (CanFam-GSD) utilizing a combination of Pacific Bioscience, Oxford Nanopore, 10X Genomics, Bionano, and Hi-C technologies. The GSD assembly is ∼80 times as contiguous as the current canid reference genome (20.9 vs 0.267 Mb contig N50), containing far fewer gaps (306 vs 23,876) and fewer scaffolds (429 vs 3,310) than the current canid reference genome CanFamv3.1. Two chromosomes (4 and 35) are assembled into single scaffolds with no gaps. BUSCO analyses of the genome assembly results show that 93.0% of the conserved single-copy genes are complete in the GSD assembly compared with 92.2% for CanFam v3.1. Homology-based gene annotation increases this value to ∼99%. Detailed examination of the evolutionarily important pancreatic amylase region reveals that there are most likely 7 copies of the gene, indicative of a duplication of 4 ancestral copies and the disruption of 1 copy. Conclusions: GSD genome assembly and annotation were produced with major improvement in completeness, continuity, and quality over the existing canid reference. This resource will enable further research related to canine diseases, the evolutionary relationships of canids, and other aspects of canid biology.

AB  - Background: Reptiles are a species-rich group with great phenotypic and life history diversity but are highly underrepresented among the vertebrate species with sequenced genomes. Results: Here, we report a high-quality genome assembly of the tegu lizard, Salvator merianae, the first lacertoid with a sequenced genome. We combined 74X Illumina short-read, 29.8X Pacific Biosciences long-read, and optical mapping data to generate a high-quality assembly with a scaffold N50 value of 55.4 Mb. The contig N50 value of this assembly is 521 Kb, making it the most contiguous reptile assembly so far. We show that the tegu assembly has the highest completeness of coding genes and conserved non-exonic elements (CNEs) compared to other reptiles. Furthermore, the tegu assembly has the highest number of evolutionarily conserved CNE pairs, corroborating a high assembly contiguity in intergenic regions. As in other reptiles, long interspersed nuclear elements comprise the most abundant transposon class. We used transcriptomic data, homology- and de novo gene predictions to annotate 22,413 coding genes, of which 16,995 (76%) likely have human orthologs as inferred by CESAR-derived gene mappings. Finally, we generated a multiple genome alignment comprising 10 squamates and 7 other amniote species and identified conserved regions that are under evolutionary constraint. CNEs cover 38 Mb (1.8%) of the tegu genome, with 3.3 Mb in these elements being squamate specific. In contrast to placental mammal-specific CNEs, very few of these squamate-specific CNEs (<20 Kb) overlap transposons, highlighting a difference in how lineage-specific CNEs originated in these two clades. Conclusions: The tegu lizard genome together with the multiple genome alignment and comprehensive conserved element datasets provide a valuable resource for comparative genomic studies of reptiles and other amniotes.

AB  - Adapted to different ecological niches, moth species belonging to the Hyles genus exhibit a spectacular diversity of larval color patterns. These species diverged ∼7.5 million years ago, making this rather young genus an interesting system to study a wide range of questions including the process of speciation, ecological adaptation, and adaptive radiation. Results: Here we present a high-quality genome assembly of the bat hawkmoth Hyles vespertilio, the first reference genome of a member of the Hyles genus. We generated 51× Pacific Biosciences long reads with an average read length of 8.9 kb. Pacific Biosciences reads longer than 4 kb were assembled into contigs, resulting in a 651.4-Mb assembly consisting of 530 contigs with an N50 value of 7.5 Mb. The circular mitochondrial contig has a length of 15,303 bp. The H. vespertilio genome is very repeat-rich and exhibits a higher repeat content (50.3%) than other Bombycoidea species such as Bombyx mori (45.7%) and Manduca sexta (27.5%). We developed a comprehensive gene annotation workflow to obtain consensus gene models from different evidence including gene projections, protein homology, transcriptome data, and ab initio predictions. The resulting gene annotation is highly complete with 94.5% of BUSCO genes being completely present, which is higher than the BUSCO completeness of the B. mori (92.2%) and M. sexta (90%) annotations. Conclusions: Our gene annotation strategy has general applicability to other genomes, and the H. vespertilio genome provides a valuable molecular resource to study a range of questions in this genus, including phylogeny, incomplete lineage sorting, speciation, and hybridization. A genome browser displaying the genome, alignments, and annotations is available at https://genome-public.pks.mpg.de/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=HLhylVes1.

AB  - Background: Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a label-free analysis method for resolving bio-molecules or pharmaceuticals in the spatial domain. It offers unique perspectives for the examination of entire organs or other tissue specimens. Owing to increasing capabilities of modern MSI devices, the use of 3D and multi-modal MSI becomes feasible in routine applications-resulting in hundreds of gigabytes of data. To fully leverage such MSI acquisitions, interactive tools for 3D image reconstruction, visualization, and analysis are required, which preferably should be open-source to allow scientists to develop custom extensions. Findings: We introduce M2aia (MSI applications for interactive analysis in MITK), a software tool providing interactive and memory-efficient data access and signal processing of multiple large MSI datasets stored in imzML format. M2aia extends MITK, a popular open-source tool in medical image processing. Besides the steps of a typical signal processing workflow, M2aia offers fast visual interaction, image segmentation, deformable 3D image reconstruction, and multi-modal registration. A unique feature is that fused data with individual mass axes can be visualized in a shared coordinate system. We demonstrate features of M2aia by reanalyzing an N-glycan mouse kidney dataset and 3D reconstruction and multi-modal image registration of a lipid and peptide dataset of a mouse brain, which we make publicly available. Conclusions: To our knowledge, M2aia is the first extensible open-source application that enables a fast, user-friendly, and interactive exploration of large datasets. M2aia is applicable to a wide range of MSI analysis tasks.

AB  - Objective To analyze the longitudinal data of multiple patients and to discover new temporal knowledge, we designed and developed the Visual Temporal Analysis Laboratory (ViTA-Lab). In this study, we demonstrate several of the capabilities of the ViTA-Lab framework through the exploration of renal-damage risk factors in patients with diabetes type II. Materials and methods The ViTA-Lab framework combines data-driven temporal data mining techniques, with interactive, query-driven, visual analytical capabilities, to support, in an integrated fashion, an iterative investigation of timeoriented clinical data and of patterns discovered in them. Patterns discovered through the data mining mode can be explored visually, and vice versa. Both analysis modes are supported by a rich underlying ontology of clinical concepts, their relations, and their temporal properties. The knowledge enables us to apply a temporal-abstraction pre-processing phase that abstracts in a context-sensitive manner raw time-stamped data into interval-based clinically meaningful interpretations, increasing the results' significance. We demonstrate our approach through the exploration of risk factors associated with future renal damage (micro-albuminuria and macro-albuminuria) and their relationship to the hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C ) and creatinine level concepts, in the longitudinal records of 22 000 patients with diabetes type II followed for up to 5 years. Results The iterative ViTA-Lab analysis process was highly feasible. Higher ranges of either normal albuminuria or normal creatinine values and their combination were shown to be significantly associated with future micro-albuminuria and macro-albuminuria. The risk increased given high HbA1C levels for women in the lower range of normal albuminuria, and for men in the higher range of albuminuria. Conclusions The ViTA-Lab framework can potentially serve as a virtual laboratory for investigations of large masses of longitudinal clinical databases, for discovery of new knowledge through interactive exploration, clustering, classification, and prediction.

AB  - Objective: The study sought to assess the feasibility of replacing the International Classification of Diseases-Tenth Revision-Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) with the International Classification of Diseases-11th Revision (ICD-11) for morbidity coding based on content analysis. Materials and Methods: The most frequently used ICD-10-CM codes from each chapter covering 60% of patients were identified from Medicare claims and hospital data. Each ICD-10-CM code was recoded in the ICD-11, using postcoordination (combination of codes) if necessary. Recoding was performed by 2 terminologists independently. Failure analysis was done for cases where full representation was not achieved even with postcoordination. After recoding, the coding guidance (inclusions, exclusions, and index) of the ICD-10-CM and ICD-11 codes were reviewed for conflict. Results: Overall, 23.5% of 943 codes could be fully represented by the ICD-11 without postcoordination. Postcoordination is the potential game changer. It supports the full representation of 8.6% of 943 codes. Moreover, with the addition of only 9 extension codes, postcoordination supports the full representation of 35.2% of 943 codes. Coding guidance review identified potential conflicts in 10% of codes, but mostly not affecting recoding. The majority of the conflicts resulted from differences in granularity and default coding assumptions between the ICD-11 and ICD-10-CM. Conclusions: With some minor enhancements to postcoordination, the ICD-11 can fully represent almost 60% of the most frequently used ICD-10-CM codes. Even without postcoordination, 23.5% full representation is comparable to the 24.3% of ICD-9-CM codes with exact match in the ICD-10-CM, so migrating from the ICD-10-CM to the ICD-11 is not necessarily more disruptive than from the International Classification of Diseases-Ninth Revision-Clinical Modification to the ICD-10-CM. Therefore, the ICD-11 (without a CM) should be considered as a candidate to replace the ICD-10-CM for morbidity coding.

AB  - Background: The European beech is arguably the most important climax broad-leaved tree species in Central Europe, widely planted for its valuable wood. Here, we report the 542 Mb draft genome sequence of an up to 300-year-old individual (Bhaga) from an undisturbed stand in the Kellerwald-Edersee National Park in central Germany. Findings: Using a hybrid assembly approach, Illumina reads with short- and long-insert libraries, coupled with long Pacific Biosciences reads, we obtained an assembled genome size of 542 Mb, in line with flow cytometric genome size estimation. The largest scaffold was of 1.15 Mb, the N50 length was 145 kb, and the L50 count was 983. The assembly contained 0.12% of Ns. A Benchmarking with Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) analysis retrieved 94% complete BUSCO genes, well in the range of other high-quality draft genomes of trees. A total of 62,012 protein-coding genes were predicted, assisted by transcriptome sequencing. In addition, we are reporting an efficient method for extracting high-molecular-weight DNA from dormant buds, by which contamination by environmental bacteria and fungi was kept at a minimum. Conclusions: The assembled genome will be a valuable resource and reference for future population genomics studies on the evolution and past climate change adaptation of beech and will be helpful for identifying genes, e.g., involved in drought tolerance, in order to select and breed individuals to adapt forestry to climate change in Europe. A continuously updated genome browser and download page can be accessed from beechgenome.net, which will include future genome versions of the reference individual Bhaga, as new sequencing approaches develop.

AB  - Background: Second and third generation sequencing technologies have revolutionised bacterial genomics. Short-read Illumina reads result in cheap but fragmented assemblies, whereas longer reads are more expensive but result in more complete genomes. The Oxford Nanopore MinION device is a revolutionary mobile sequencer that can produce thousands of long, single molecule reads. Results: We sequenced Bacteroides fragilis strain BE1 using both the Illumina MiSeq and Oxford Nanopore MinION platforms. We were able to assemble a single chromosome of 5.18 Mb, with no gaps, using publicly available software and commodity computing hardware. We identified gene rearrangements and the state of invertible promoters in the strain. Conclusions: The single chromosome assembly of Bacteroides fragilis strain BE1 was achieved using only modest amounts of data, publicly available software and commodity computing hardware. This combination of technologies offers the possibility of ultra-cheap, high quality, finished bacterial genomes.

AB  - Supplement 23 to DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications for Medicine), Structured Reporting, is a specification that supports a semantically rich representation of image and waveform content, enabling experts to share image and related patient information. DICOM SR supports the representation of textual and coded data linked to images and waveforms. Nevertheless, the medical information technology community needs models that work as bridges between the DICOM relational model and open object-oriented technologies. The authors assert that representations of the DICOM Structured Reporting standard, using object-oriented modeling languages such as the Unified Modeling Language, can provide a high-level reference view of the semantically rich framework of DICOM and its complex structures. They have produced an object-oriented model to represent the DICOM SR standard and have derived XML-exchangeable representations of this model using World Wide Web Consortium specifications. They expect the model to benefit developers and system architects who are interested in developing applications that are compliant with the DICOM SR specification.

AB  - Background: The combination of long reads and long-range information to produce genome assemblies is now accepted as a common standard. This strategy not only allows access to the gene catalogue of a given species but also reveals the architecture and organization of chromosomes, including complex regions such as telomeres and centromeres. The Brassica genus is not exempt, and many assemblies based on long reads are now available. The reference genome for Brassica napus, Darmor-bzh, which was published in 2014, was produced using short reads and its contiguity was extremely low compared with current assemblies of the Brassica genus. Findings: Herein, we report the new long-read assembly of Darmor-bzh genome (Brassica napus) generated by combining long-read sequencing data and optical and genetic maps. Using the PromethION device and 6 flowcells, we generated ∼16 million long reads representing 93× coverage and, more importantly, 6× with reads longer than 100 kb. This ultralong-read dataset allows us to generate one of the most contiguous and complete assemblies of a Brassica genome to date (contig N50 > 10 Mb). In addition, we exploited all the advantages of the nanopore technology to detect modified bases and sequence transcriptomic data using direct RNA to annotate the genome and focus on resistance genes. Conclusion: Using these cutting-edge technologies, and in particular by relying on all the advantages of the nanopore technology, we provide the most contiguous Brassica napus assembly, a resource that will be valuable to the Brassica community for crop improvement and will facilitate the rapid selection of agronomically important traits.

AB  - Objective: Develop and evaluate a foundational oncology-specific standard for the communication and coordination of care throughout the cancer journey, with early-stage breast cancer as the use case. Materials and Methods: Owing to broad uptake of the Health Level Seven (HL7) Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture (C-CDA) by health information exchanges and large provider organizations, we developed an implementation guide in congruence with C-CDA. The resultant product was balloted through the HL7 process and subsequently implemented by two groups: the Health Story Project (Health Story) and the Athena Breast Health Network (Athena). Results: The HL7 Implementation Guide for CDA, Release 2: Clinical Oncology Treatment Plan and Summary, DSTU Release 1 (eCOTPS) was successfully balloted and published as a Draft Standard for Trial Use (DSTU) in October 2013. Health Story successfully implemented the eCOTPS the 2014 meeting of the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) in a clinical vignette. During the evaluation and implementation of eCOPS, Athena identified two practical concerns: (1) the need for additional CDA templates specific to their use case; (2) the many-to-many mapping of Athena-defined data elements to eCOTPS. Discussion: Early implementation of eCOTPS has demonstrated successful vendor-agnostic transmission of oncologyspecific data. The modularity enabled by the C-CDA framework ensures the relatively straightforward expansion of the eCOTPS to include other cancer subtypes. Lessons learned during the process will strengthen future versions of the standard. Conclusion: eCOTPS is the first oncology-specific CDA standard to achieve HL7 DSTU status. Oncology standards will improve care throughout the cancer journey by allowing the efficient transmission of reliable, meaningful, and current clinical data between the many involved stakeholders.

AB  - The authors provide a survey of how images are used in radiation therapy to improve the precision of radiation therapy plans, and delivery of radiation treatment. In contrast to diagnostic radiology, where the focus is on interpretation of the images to decide if disease is present, radiation therapy quantifies the extent of the region to be treated, and relates it to the proposed treatment using a quantitative modeling system called a radiation treatment planning (RTP) system. This necessitates several requirements of image display and manipulation in radiation therapy that are not usually important in diagnosis. The images must have uniform spatial fidelity: i.e., the pixel size must be known and consistent throughout individual images, and between spatially related sets. The exact spatial relation of images in a set must be known. Radiation oncologists draw on images to define target volumes; dosimetrists use RTP systems to superimpose quantitative models of radiation beams and radiation dose distributions on the images and on the sets of organ and target contours derived from them. While this mainly uses transverse cross-sectional images, projected images are also important, both those produced by the radiation treatment simulator and the treatment machines, and so-called "digital reconstructed radiographs," computed from spatially related sets of cross-sectional images. These requirements are not typically met by software produced for radiologists but are addressed by RTP systems. This review briefly summarizes ongoing work on software development in this area at the University of Washington Department of Radiation Oncology.

AB  - Cells are powered by a large set of macromolecular complexes, which work together in a crowded environment. The in situ mechanisms of these complexes are unclear because their 3D distribution, organization, and interactions are largely unknown. Electron cryotomography (cryo-ET) can address these knowledge gaps because it produces cryotomograms - 3D images that reveal biological structure at ∼4-nm resolution. Cryo-ET uses no fixation, dehydration, staining, or plastic embedment, so cellular features are visualized in a life-like, frozen-hydrated state. To study chromatin and mitotic machinery in situ, we subjected yeast cells to genetic and chemical perturbations, cryosectioned them, and then imaged the cells by cryo-ET. Findings: Here we share >1,000 cryo-ET raw datasets of cryosectioned budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiaecollected as part of previously published studies. These data will be valuable to cell biologists who are interested in the nanoscale organization of yeasts and of eukaryotic cells in general. All the unpublished tilt series and a subset of corresponding cryotomograms have been deposited in the EMPIAR resource for the community to use freely. To improve tilt series discoverability, we have uploaded metadata and preliminary notes to publicly accessible Google Sheets, EMPIAR, and GigaDB. Conclusions: Cellular cryo-ET data can be mined to obtain new cell-biological, structural, and 3D statistical insights in situ. These data contain structures not visible in traditional electron-microscopy data. Template matching and subtomogram averaging of known macromolecular complexes can reveal their 3D distributions and low-resolution structures. Furthermore, these data can serve as testbeds for high-throughput image-analysis pipelines, as training sets for feature-recognition software, for feasibility analysis when planning new structural-cell-biology projects, and as practice data for students.

AB  - Objective: Representing nursing data sets in a standard way will help to facilitate sharing relevant information across settings. We aimed to populate nursing process and outcome metrics with electronic health record (EHR) data and then compare the results with event reporting systems. Methods: We used the "eMeasure" development process of the National Quality Forum adopted by the American Nurses Association. We used operational definitions of quality measures from the American Nurses Association and the US Institute for Healthcare Improvement and employed concept mapping of local data elements to 2 controlled vocabularies to define a standard data dictionary: (1) Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes and (2) International Classification for Nursing Practice. We assessed feasibility using the nursing data set of 7829 and 8199 patients from 2 general hospitals with different EHR systems. Using inpatient falls as a use case, we compared the populated measures with results from the event reporting systems. Results: We identified 17 care components and 118 unique concepts and matched them with data elements in the EHRs. Including suboptimal mapping, 98% of the assessment concepts mapped to Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes and 52.9% of intervention concepts mapped to International Classification for Nursing Practice. While not all process indicators were available from event reporting systems, we successfully populated 9 fall prevention process indicators and the fall rate outcome indicator from the 2 EHRs. We were unable to populate the falls with an injury rate indicator. Conclusions: EHR data can populate fall prevention process measure metrics and at least one inpatient fall prevention outcome metric.

AB  - Objective: This study assessed the effect of a handheld computer-based decision support system (DSS) on antibiotic use and patient outcomes in a critical care unit. Design: A DSS containing four types of evidence (patient microbiology reports, local antibiotic guidelines, unit-specific antibiotic susceptibility data for common bacterial pathogens, and a clinical pulmonary infection score calculator) was developed and implemented on a handheld computer for use in the intensive care unit at a tertiary referral hospital. System impact was assessed in a prospective "before/after" cohort trial lasting 12 months. Outcome measures were defined daily doses (DDDs) of antibiotics per 1,000 patient-days, patient length of stay, and mortality. Results: The number of admissions, APACHE (Acute Physiology, Age, and Chronic Health Evaluation) II and SAPS (Simplified Acute Physiology Score) II for patients in preintervention, and intervention (DSS use) periods were statistically comparable. The mean patient length of stay and the use of antibiotics in the unit during six months of the DSS use decreased from 7.15 to 6.22 bed-days (p = 0.02) and from 1,767 DDD to 1,458 DDD per 1,000 patient-days (p = 0.04), respectively, with no change in mortality. The DSS was accessed 674 times during 168 days of the trial. Microbiology reports and antibiotic guidelines were the two most commonly used (53% and 22.5%, respectively) types of evidence. The greatest reduction was observed in the use of β-lactamase-resistant penicillins and vancomycin. Conclusion: Handheld computer-based decision support contributed to a significant reduction in patient length of stay and antibiotic prescribing in a critical care unit.

AB  - Objective: To compare three potential sources of controlled clinical terminology (READ codes version 3.1, SNOMED International, and Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) version 1.6) relative to attributes of completeness, clinical taxonomy, administrative mapping, term definitions and clarity (duplicate coding rate). Methods: The authors assembled 1929 source concept records from a variety of clinical information taken from four medical centers across the United States. The source data included medical as well as ample nursing terminology. The source records were coded in each scheme by an investigator and checked by the coding scheme owner. The codings were then scored by an independent panel of clinicians for acceptability. Codes were checked for definitions provided with the scheme. Codes for a random sample of source records were analyzed by an investigator for "parent" and "child" codes within the scheme. Parent and child pairs were scored by an independent panel of medical informatics specialists for clinical acceptability. Administrative and billing code mapping from the published scheme were reviewed for all coded records and analyzed by independent reviewers for accuracy. The investigator for each scheme exhaustively searched a sample of coded records for duplications. Results: SNOMED was judged to be significantly more complete in coding the source material than the other schemes (SNOMED* 70%; READ 57%; UMLS 50%; *p < .00001). SNOMED also had a richer clinical taxonomy judged by the number of acceptable first-degree relatives per coded concept (SNOMED* 4.56; UMLS 3.17; READ 2.14, *p < .005). Only the UMLS provided any definitions; these were found for 49% of records which had a coding assignment. READ and UMLS had better administrative mappings (composite score: READ* 40.6%; UMLS* 36.1%; SNOMED 20.7%, *p <. 00001), and SNOMED had substantially more duplications of coding assignments (duplication rate: READ 0%; UMLS 4.2%; SNOMED* 13.9%, *p <. 004) associated with a loss of clarity. Conclusion: No major terminology source can lay claim to being the ideal resource for a computer-based patient record. However, based upon this analysis of releases for April 1995, SNOMED International is considerably more complete, has a compositional nature and a richer taxonomy. It suffers from less clarity, resulting from a lack of syntax and evolutionary changes in its coding scheme. READ has greater clarity and better mapping to administrative schemes (ICD-10 and OPCS-4), is rapidly changing and is less complete. UMLS is a rich lexical resource, with mappings to many source vocabularies. It provides definitions for many of its terms. However, due to the varying granularities and purposes of its source schemes, it has limitations for representation of clinical concepts within a computer-based patient record.

AB  - This paper presents a method to improve the navigation and manipulation of radiological images through a sterile hand gesture recognition interface based on attentional contextual cues. Computer vision algorithms were developed to extract intention and attention cues from the surgeon's behavior and combine them with sensory data from a commodity depth camera. The developed interface was tested in a usability experiment to assess the effectiveness of the new interface. An image navigation and manipulation task was performed, and the gesture recognition accuracy, false positives and task completion times were computed to evaluate system performance. Experimental results show that gesture interaction and surgeon behavior analysis can be used to accurately navigate, manipulate and access MRI images, and therefore this modality could replace the use of keyboard and mice-based interfaces.

AB  - Clinical study data management systems (CSDMSs) have many similarities to clinical patient record systems (CPRSs) in their focus on recording clinical parameters. Requirements for ad hoc query interfaces for both systems would therefore appear to be highly similar. However, a clinical study is concerned primarily with collective responses of groups of subjects to standardized therapeutic interventions for the same underlying clinical condition. The parameters that are recorded in CSDMSs tend to be more diverse than those required for patient management in non-research settings, because of the greater emphasis on questionnaires for which responses to each question are recorded separately. The differences between CSDMSs and CPRSs are reflected in the metadata that support the respective systems' operation, and need to be reflected in the query interfaces. The authors describe major revisions of their previously described CSDMS ad hoc query interface to meet CSDMS needs more fully, as well as its porting to a Web-based platform.

AB  - Many adults with cancer are not enrolled in clinical trials because caregivers do not have the time to match the patient's clinical findings with varying eligibility criteria associated with multiple trials for which the patient might be eligible. The authors developed a point-of-use portable decision support tool (DS-TRIEL) to automate this matching process. The support tool consists of a hand-held computer with a programmable relational database. A two-level hierarchic decision framework was used for the identification of eligible subjects for two open breast cancer clinical trials. The hand-held computer also provides protocol consent forms and schemas to further help the busy oncologist. This decision support tool and the decision framework on which it is based could be used for multiple trials and different cancer sites.

AB  - Objective: There is a need to integrate the various theoretical frameworks and formalisms for modeling clinical guidelines, workflows, and pathways, in order to move beyond providing support for individual clinical decisions and toward the provision of process-oriented, patient-centered, health information systems (HIS). In this review, we analyze the challenges in developing process-oriented HIS that formally model guidelines, workflows, and care pathways. Methods: A qualitative meta-synthesis was performed on studies published in English between 1995 and 2010 that addressed the modeling process and reported the exposition of a new methodology, model, system implementation, or system architecture. Thematic analysis, principal component analysis (PCA) and data visualisation techniques were used to identify and cluster the underlying implementation 'challenge' themes. Results: One hundred and eight relevant studies were selected for review. Twenty-five underlying 'challenge' themes were identified. These were clustered into 10 distinct groups, from which a conceptual model of the implementation process was developed. Discussion and conclusion: We found that the development of systems supporting individual clinical decisions is evolving toward the implementation of adaptable care pathways on the semantic web, incorporating formal, clinical, and organizational ontologies, and the use of workflow management systems. These architectures now need to be implemented and evaluated on a wider scale within clinical settings.

AB  - Recent developments in medical informatics research have afforded possibilities for great advances in health care delivery. These exciting opportunities also present formidable challenges to the implementation and integration of technologies in the workplace. As in most domains, there is a gulf between technologic artifacts and end users. Since medical practice is a human endeavor, there is a need for bridging disciplines to enable clinicians to benefit from rapid technologic advances. This in turn necessitates a broadening of disciplinary boundaries to consider cognitive and social factors pertaining to the design and use of technology. The authors argue for a place of prominence for cognitive science. Cognitive science provides a framework for the analysis and modeling of complex human performance and has considerable applicability to a range of issues in informatics. Its methods have been employed to illuminate different facets of design and implementation. This approach has also yielded insights into the mechanisms and processes involved in collaborative design. Cognitive scientific methods and theories are illustrated in the context of two examples that examine human-computer interaction in medical contexts and computer-mediated collaborative processes. The framework outlined in this paper can be used to refine the process of iterative design, end-user training, and productive practice.

AB  - Objective: Audio is increasingly used to access information on the Internet through virtual assistants and smart speakers. Our objective is to evaluate the distribution of health information through audio. Materials and Methods: We conducted 2 studies to compare comprehension after reading or listening to information using a new corpus containing short text snippets from Cochrane (N=50) and Wikipedia (N=50). In study 1, the snippets were first presented as audio or text followed by a multiple-choice question. Then, the same information was presented as text and the question was repeated in addition to questions about perceived difficulty, severity and the likelihood of encountering the disease. In study 2, the first multiple-choice question was replaced with a free recall question. Results: Study 1 showed that information comprehension is very similar in both presentation modes (53% accuracy for text and 55% for audio). Study 2 showed that information retention is higher with text, but similar comprehension. Both studies show improvement in performance with repeated information presentation. Discussion: Audio presentation of information is effective and the format novel. Performance was slightly lower with audio when asked to repeat information, but comparable to text for answering questions. Additional studies are needed with different types of information and presentation combinations. Conclusion: The use of audio to provide health information is a promising field and will become increasingly important with the popularity of smart speakers and virtual assistants, particularly for consumers who do not use computers, for example minority groups, or those with limited sight or motor control.

AB  - Objective: India reported its first coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case in the state of Kerala and an outbreak initiated subsequently. The Department of Health Services, Government of Kerala, initially released daily updates through daily textual bulletins for public awareness to control the spread of the disease. However, these unstructured data limit upstream applications, such as visualization, and analysis, thus demanding refinement to generate open and reusable datasets. Materials and Methods: Through a citizen science initiative, we leveraged publicly available and crowd-verified data on COVID-19 outbreak in Kerala from the government bulletins and media outlets to generate reusable datasets. This was further visualized as a dashboard through a front-end Web application and a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) repository, which serves as an application programming interface for the front end. Results: From the sourced data, we provided real-time analysis, and daily updates of COVID-19 cases in Kerala, through a user-friendly bilingual dashboard (https://covid19kerala.info/) for nonspecialists. To ensure longevity and reusability, the dataset was deposited in an open-access public repository for future analysis. Finally, we provide outbreak trends and demographic characteristics of the individuals affected with COVID-19 in Kerala during the first 138 days of the outbreak. Discussion: We anticipate that our dataset can form the basis for future studies, supplemented with clinical and epidemiological data from the individuals affected with COVID-19 in Kerala. Conclusions: We reported a citizen science initiative on the COVID-19 outbreak in Kerala to collect and deposit data in a structured format, which was utilized for visualizing the outbreak trend and describing demographic characteristics of affected individuals.

AB  - Objective The objective of openFDA is to facilitate access and use of big important Food and Drug Administration public datasets by developers, researchers, and the public through harmonization of data across disparate FDA datasets provided via application programming interfaces (APIs). Materials and Methods Using cutting-edge technologies deployed on FDA's new public cloud computing infrastructure, openFDA provides open data for easier, faster (over 300 requests per second per process), and better access to FDA datasets; open source code and documentation shared on GitHub for open community contributions of examples, apps and ideas; and infrastructure that can be adopted for other public health big data challenges. Results Since its launch on June 2, 2014, openFDA has developed four APIs for drug and device adverse events, recall information for all FDA-regulated products, and drug labeling. There have been more than 20 million API calls (more than half from outside the United States), 6000 registered users, 20,000 connected Internet Protocol addresses, and dozens of new software (mobile or web) apps developed. A case study demonstrates a use of openFDA data to understand an apparent association of a drug with an adverse event. Conclusion With easier and faster access to these datasets, consumers worldwide can learn more about FDA-regulated products.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Physicians often describe the electronic health record (EHR) as a cumbersome impediment to meaningful work, which has important implications for physician well-being. This systematic review (1) assesses organizational, physician, and information technology factors associated with EHR-related impacts on physician well-being; and (2) highlights potential improvements to EHR form and function, as recommended by frontline physicians. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ProQuest, and Web of Science databases were searched for literature describing EHR use by physicians and markers of well-being. RESULTS: After reviewing 7388 article, 35 ultimately met the inclusion criteria. Multiple factors across all levels were associated with EHR-related well-being among physicians. Notable predictors amenable to interventions include (1) total EHR time, (2) after-hours EHR time, (3) on-site EHR support, (4) perceived EHR usability, (5) in-basket burden, and (6) documentation burden. Physician recommendations also echoed these themes. CONCLUSIONS: There are multiple complex factors involved in EHR-related well-being among physicians. Our review shows physicians have recommendations that span from federal regulations to organizational policies to EHR modifications. Future research should assess multipronged interventions that address these factors. As primary stakeholders, physicians should be included in the planning and implementation of such modifications to ensure compatibility with physician needs and clinical workflows.

AB  - Objective We show how the HL7 Virtual Medical Record (vMR) standard can be used to design and implement a data integrator (DI) component that collects patient information from heterogeneous sources and stores it into a personal health record, from which it can then retrieve data. Our working hypothesis is that the HL7 vMR standard in its release 1 version can properly capture the semantics needed to drive evidence-based clinical decision support systems. Materials and Methods To achieve seamless communication between the personal health record and heterogeneous data consumers, we used a three-pronged approach. First, the choice of the HL7 vMR as a message model for all components accompanied by the use of medical vocabularies eases their semantic interoperability. Second, the DI follows a service-oriented approach to provide access to system components. Third, an XML database provides the data layer. Results The DI supports requirements of a guideline-based clinical decision support system implemented in two clinical domains and settings, ensuring reliable and secure access, high performance, and simplicity of integration, while complying with standards for the storage and processing of patient information needed for decision support and analytics. This was tested within the framework of a multinational project (www.mobiguide-project.eu) aimed at developing a ubiquitous patient guidance system (PGS). Discussion The vMR model with its extension mechanism is demonstrated to be effective for data integration and communication within a distributed PGS implemented for two clinical domains across different healthcare settings in two nations.

AB  - Effective response to natural or man-made disasters (i.e., terrorism) is predicated on the ability to communicate among the many organizations involved. Disaster response exercises enable disaster planners and responders to test procedures and technologies and incorporate the lessons learned from past disasters or exercises. On May 31 and June 1, 2002, one such exercise event took place at the Camp Lejeune Marine Corps Base in Jacksonville, North Carolina. During the exercise, East Carolina University tested: (1) in-place Telehealth networks and (2) rapidly deployable communications, networking, and data collection technologies such as satellite communications, local wireless networking, on-scene video, and clinical and environmental data acquisition and telemetry. Exercise participants included local, county, state, and military emergency medical services (EMS), emergency management, specialized response units, and local fire and police units. The technologies and operations concepts tested at the exercise and recommendations for using telehealth to improve disaster response are described.

AB  - Background: RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is an indispensable tool in the study of gene regulation. While the technology has brought with it better transcript coverage and quantification, there remain considerable barriers to entry for the computational biologist to analyse large data sets. There is a real need for a repository of uniformly processed RNA-seq data that is easy to use. Findings: To address these obstacles, we developed Digital Expression Explorer 2 (DEE2), a web-based repository of RNA-seq data in the form of gene-level and transcript-level expression counts. DEE2 contains >5.3 trillion assigned reads from 580,000 RNA-seq data sets including species Escherichia coli, yeast, Arabidopsis, worm, fruit fly, zebrafish, rat, mouse, and human. Base-space sequence data downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information Sequence Read Archive underwent quality control prior to transcriptome and genome mapping using open-source tools. Uniform data processing methods ensure consistency across experiments, facilitating fast and reproducible meta-analyses. Conclusions: The web interface allows users to quickly identify data sets of interest using accession number and keyword searches. The data can also be accessed programmatically using a specifically designed R package. We demonstrate that DEE2 data are compatible with statistical packages such as edgeR or DESeq. Bulk data are also available for download. DEE2 can be found at http://dee2.io.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Despite a proliferation of applications (apps) to conveniently collect patient-reported outcomes (PROs) from patients, PRO data are yet to be seamlessly integrated with electronic health records (EHRs) in a way that improves interoperability and scalability. We applied the newly created PRO standards from the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology to facilitate the collection and integration of standardized PRO data. A novel multitiered architecture was created to enable seamless integration of PRO data via Substitutable Medical Apps and Reusable Technologies on Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources apps and scaled to different EHR platforms in multiple ambulatory settings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a standards-based approach to deploy 2 apps that source and surface PRO data in real-time for provider use within the EHR and which rely on PRO assessments from an external center to streamline app and EHR integration. RESULTS: The apps were developed to enable patients to answer validated assessments (eg, a Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System including using a Computer Adaptive Test format). Both apps were developed to populate the EHR in real time using the Health Level Seven FHIR standard allowing providers to view patients' data during the clinical encounter. The process of implementing this architecture with 2 different apps across 18 ambulatory care sites and 3 different EHR platforms is described. CONCLUSION: Our approach and solution proved feasible, secure, and time- and resource-efficient. We offer actionable guidance for this technology to be scaled and adapted to promote adoption in diverse ambulatory care settings and across different EHRs.

AB  - Objective: To determine the extent to which a combination of existing machine-readable health terminologies cover the concepts and terms needed for a comprehensive controlled vocabulary for health information systems by carrying out a distributed national experiment using the Internet and the UMLS Knowledge Sources, lexical programs, and server. Methods: Using a specially designed Web-based interface to the UMLS Knowledge Source Server, participants searched the more than 30 vocabularies in the 1996 UMLS Metathesaurus and three planned additions to determine if concepts for which they desired controlled terminology were present or absent. For each term submitted, the interface presented a candidate exact match or a set of potential approximate matches from which the participant selected the most closely related concept. The interface captured a profile of the terms submitted by the participant and for each term searched, information about the concept (if any) selected by the participant. The term information was loaded into a database at NLM for review and analysis and was also available to be downloaded by the participant. A team of subject experts reviewed records to identify matches missed by participants and to correct any obvious errors in relationships. The editors of SNOMED International and the Read Codes were given a random sample of reviewed terms for which exact meaning matches were not found to identify exact matches that were missed or any valid combinations of concepts that were synonymous to input terms. The 1997 UMLS Metathesaurus was used in the semantic type and vocabulary source analysis because it included most of the three planned additions. Results: Sixty-three participants submitted a total of 41,127 terms, which represented 32,679 normalized strings. More than 80% of the terms submitted were wanted for parts of the patient record related to the patient's condition. Following review, 58% of all submitted terms had exact meaning matches in the controlled vocabularies in the test, 41% had related concepts, and 1% were not found. Of the 28% of the terms which were narrower in meaning than a concept in the controlled vocabularies, 86% shared lexical items with the broader concept, but had additional modification. The percentage of exact meaning matches varied by specialty from 45% to 71%. Twenty-nine different vocabularies contained meanings for some of the 23,837 terms (a maximum of 12,707 discrete concepts) with exact meaning matches. Based on preliminary data and analysis, individual vocabularies contained <1% to 63% of the terms and <1% to 54% of the concepts. Only SNOMED International and the Read Codes had more than 60% of the terms and more than 50% of the concepts. Conclusions: The combination of existing controlled vocabularies included in the test represents the meanings of the majority of the terminology needed to record patient conditions, providing substantially more exact matches than any individual vocabulary in the set. From a technical and organizational perspective, the test was successful and should serve as a useful model, both for distributed input to the enhancement of controlled vocabularies and for other kinds of collaborative informatics research.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate: (1) the effectiveness of wireless handheld computers for online information retrieval in clinical settings; (2) the role of MEDLINE® in answering clinical questions raised at the point of care. Design: A prospective single-cohort study: accompanying medical teams on teaching rounds, five internal medicine residents used and evaluated MD on Tap, an application for handheld computers, to seek answers in real time to clinical questions arising at the point of care. Measurements: All transactions were stored by an intermediate server. Evaluators recorded clinical scenarios and questions, identified MEDLINE citations that answered the questions, and submitted daily and summative reports of their experience. A senior medical librarian corroborated the relevance of the selected citation to each scenario and question. Results: Evaluators answered 68% of 363 background and foreground clinical questions during rounding sessions using a variety of MD on Tap features in an average session length of less than four minutes. The evaluator, the number and quality of query terms, the total number of citations found for a query, and the use of auto-spellcheck significantly contributed to the probability of query success. Conclusion: Handheld computers with Internet access are useful tools for healthcare providers to access MEDLINE in real time. MEDLINE citations can answer specific clinical questions when several medical terms are used to form a query. The MD on Tap application is an effective interface to MEDLINE in clinical settings, allowing clinicians to quickly find relevant citations. © 2007 J Am Med Inform Assoc.

AB  - Objective To describe the creation and evaluate the use of a wiki by medical residents, and to determine if a wiki would be a useful tool for improving the experience, efficiency, and education of housestaff. Materials and methods In 2008, a team of medical residents built a wiki containing institutional knowledge and reference information using Microsoft SharePoint. We tracked visit data for 3 years, and performed an audit of page views and updates in the second year. We evaluated the attitudes of medical residents toward the wiki using a survey. Results Users accessed the wiki 23 218, 35 094, and 40 545 times in each of three successive academic years from 2008 to 2011. In the year two audit, 85 users made a total of 1082 updates to 176 pages and of these, 91 were new page creations by 17 users. Forty-eight percent of residents edited a page. All housestaff felt the wiki improved their ability to complete tasks, and 90%, 89%, and 57% reported that the wiki improved their experience, efficiency, and education, respectively, when surveyed in academic year 2009-2010. Discussion A wiki is a useful and popular tool for organizing administrative and educational content for residents. Housestaff felt strongly that the wiki improved their workflow, but a smaller educational impact was observed. Nearly half of the housestaff edited the wiki, suggesting broad buy-in among the residents. Conclusion A wiki is a feasible and useful tool for improving information retrieval for house officers.

AB  - Objectives: To test a patient-centered, tablet-based bedside educational intervention in the hospital and to evaluate the efficacy of this intervention to increase patient engagement with their patient portals during hospitalization and after discharge. Materials and Methods: We conducted a randomized controlled trial of adult patients admitted to the hospitalist service in one large, academic medical center. All participants were supplied with a tablet computer for 1 day during their inpatient stay and assistance with portal registration and initial login as needed. Additionally, intervention group patients received a focused bedside education to demonstrate key functions of the portal and explain the importance of these functions to their upcoming transition to post-discharge care. Our primary outcomes were proportion of patients who logged into the portal and completed specific tasks after discharge. Secondary outcomes were observed ability to navigate the portal before discharge and self-reported patient satisfaction with bedside tablet use to access the portal. Results: We enrolled 97 participants (50 intervention; 47 control); overall 57% logged into their portals 1 time within 7 days of discharge (58% intervention vs. 55% control). Mean number of logins was higher for the intervention group (3.48 vs. 2.94 control), and mean number of specific portal tasks performed was higher in the intervention group; however, no individual comparison reached statistical significance. Observed ability to login and navigate the portal in the hospital was higher for the intervention group (64% vs. 60% control), but only 1 specific portal task was significant (view provider messaging tab: 92% vs. 77% control, P ¼ .04). Time needed to deliver the intervention was brief (<15 min for 80%), and satisfaction with the bedside tablet to access the portal was high in the intervention group (88% satisfied/very satisfied). Conclusion: Our intervention was highly feasible and acceptable to patients, and we found a highly consistent, but statistically non-significant, trend towards higher inpatient engagement and post-discharge use of key portal functions among patients in the intervention group.

AB  - Background and objective The objective of this study was to identify physicians' and pharmacists' perceptions of the challenges and benefits to implementing a nationwide electronic prescribing network linking medical clinics and community pharmacies in Quebec, Canada. Methods Forty-nine people (12 general practitioners, 2 managers, 33 community pharmacists, and 2 pharmacy staff members) from 40 points of care (10 primary care clinics (42% of all the connected sites) and 30 community pharmacies (44%)) were interviewed in 2013. Verbatim transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results A low level of network use was observed. Most pharmacists processed e-prescriptions by manual entry instead of importing electronically. They reported concerns about potential errors generated by importing e-prescriptions, mainly due to the instruction field. Paper prescriptions were still perceived as the best means for safe and effective processing of prescriptions in pharmacies. Speed issues when validating e-prescription messages were seen as an irritant by physicians, and resulted in several of them abandoning transmission. Displaying the medications based on the dispensing data was identified as the main obstacle to meaningful use of medication histories. Conclusions Numerous challenges impeded realization of the benefits of this network. Standards for e-prescription messages, as well as rules for message validation, need to be improved to increase the potential benefits of e-prescriptions. Standard drug terminology including the concept of clinical medication should be developed, and the implementation of rules in local applications to allow for the classification and reconciliation of medication lists from dispensing data should be made a priority.

AB  - Cloud computing refers to subscription-based, fee-for service utilization of computer hardware and software over the Internet. The model is gaining acceptance for business information technology (IT) applications because it allows capacity and functionality to increase on the fly without major investment in infrastructure, personnel or licensing fees. Large IT investments can be converted to a series of smaller operating expenses. Cloud architectures could potentially be superior to traditional electronic health record (EHR) designs in terms of economy, efficiency and utility. A central issue for EHR developers in the US is that these systems are constrained by federal regulatory legislation and oversight. These laws focus on security and privacy, which are well-recognized challenges for cloud computing systems in general. EHRs built with the cloud computing model can achieve acceptable privacy and security through business associate contracts with cloud providers that specify compliance requirements, performance metrics and liability sharing.

AB  - In this case report, the authors describe the implementation of a system for collecting patient-reported outcomes and integrating results in an electronic health record. The objective was to identify lessons learned in overcoming barriers to collecting and integrating patient-reported outcomes in an electronic health record. The authors analyzed qualitative data in 42 documents collected from system development meetings, written feedback from users, and clinical observations with practice staff, providers, and patients. Guided by the Unified Theory on the Adoption and Use of Information Technology, 5 emergent themes were identified. Two barriers emerged: (i) uncertain clinical benefit and (ii) time, work flow, and effort constraints. Three facilitators emerged: (iii) process automation, (iv) usable system interfaces, and (v) collecting patient-reported outcomes for the right patient at the right time. For electronic health record-integrated patient-reported outcomes to succeed as useful clinical tools, system designers must ensure the clinical relevance of the information being collected while minimizing provider, staff, and patient burden.

AB  - Disaster management utilizes diverse technologies to accomplish a complex set of tasks. Despite a decade of experience, few published reports have reviewed application of telemedicine (clinical care at a distance enabled by telecommunication) in disaster situations. Appropriate new telemedicine applications can improve future disaster medicine outcomes, based on lessons learned from a decade of civilian and military disaster (wide-area) telemedicine deployments. This manuscript reviews the history of telemedicine activities in actual disasters and similar scenarios as well as ongoing telemedicine innovations that may be applicable to disaster situations. Emergency care providers must begin to plan effectively to utilize disaster-specific telemedicine applications to improve future outcomes.

AB  - The Model for Assistance in the Orientation of a User within Coding Systems (MAOUSSC) project has been designed to provide a representation for medical and surgical procedures that allows several applications to be developed from several viewpoints. It is based on a conceptual model, a controlled set of terms, and Web server development. The design includes the UMLS knowledge sources associated with additional knowledge about medico-surgical procedures. The model was implemented using a relational database. The authors developed a complete interface for the Web presentation, with the intermediary layer being written in PERL. The server has been used for the representation of medico-surgical procedures that occur in the discharge summaries of the national survey of hospital activities that is performed by the French Health Statistics Agency in order to produce inpatient profiles. The authors describe the current status of the MAOUSSC server and discuss their interest in using such a server to assist in the coordination of terminology tasks and in the sharing of controlled terminologies.

AB  - Objective To describe the creation and evaluate the usage of the first medical wiki linked to dedicated mobile applications.Methods With the support of multiple current and past contributors, we developed an emergency medicine wiki linked to offline mobile applications (WikEM) in 2009. First deployment was at the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center emergency medicine residency program, with the wiki later opened to public use. To evaluate the project, we performed a post hoc analysis of system use and surveyed 8 years of current and past residents. Outcomes included website and application analytics, as well as survey analysis by composite response categories.Results Over the 6-year period of this project, the wiki grew to over 7250 pages and 45 500 edits. The website receives more than 85 000 user sessions per month, with over 150 million page views to date. There have been over 200 000 installs of the mobile applications, progressing to produce over 5000 mobile sessions daily. Of potential survey respondents, 87.7% (107) completed the Internet-based survey. Among those who contributed to the wiki, 74.6% reported that it benefited their understanding of core emergency medicine content. Of program graduates, the vast majority reported use of the wiki as a resource after residency (93.8%) along with improvement in clinical efficiency (89.7%). Residents reported higher use and a more favorable opinion of wiki usefulness compared to graduates (P < .001).Conclusions A wiki paired with mobile applications is beneficial for resident education and useful in post-residency clinical practice.

AB  - Background: The integration and visualization of multimodal datasets is a common challenge in biomedical informatics. Several recent studies of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data have illustrated important relationships between morphology observed in whole-slide images, outcome, and genetic events. The pairing of genomics and rich clinical descriptions with whole-slide imaging provided by TCGA presents a unique opportunity to perform these correlative studies. However, better tools are needed to integrate the vast and disparate data types. Objective: To build an integrated web-based platform supporting whole-slide pathology image visualization and data integration. Materials and methods: All images and genomic data were directly obtained from the TCGA and National Cancer Institute (NCI) websites. Results: The Cancer Digital Slide Archive (CDSA) produced is accessible to the public (http://cancer. digitalslidearchive.net) and currently hosts more than 20 000 whole-slide images from 22 cancer types. Discussion: The capabilities of CDSA are demonstrated using TCGA datasets to integrate pathology imaging with associated clinical, genomic and MRI measurements in glioblastomas and can be extended to other tumor types. CDSA also allows URL-based sharing of wholeslide images, and has preliminary support for directly sharing regions of interest and other annotations. Images can also be selected on the basis of other metadata, such as mutational profile, patient age, and other relevant characteristics. Conclusions: With the increasing availability of wholeslide scanners, analysis of digitized pathology images will become increasingly important in linking morphologic observations with genomic and clinical endpoints.

AB  - Objective: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its risk factors disproportionately affect people returning from incarceration. These individuals face multiple barriers to obtaining care, which can impact CVD and risk factor management and may be mitigated through use of a smartphone application (app). Therefore, we explored the CVD-related needs of people released from incarceration and which app features would support these needs. Materials and Methods: In 2019, we collected qualitative data through 7 focus groups with 76 returning citizens and 19 key informants through interviews and small group discussions in Baltimore, Maryland. Verbal data were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using inductive thematic coding with N-Vivo qualitative software. Results: Returning citizens face multiple barriers when trying to engage in care and services related to cardiovascular health, including around medications and health insurance. Some major challenges were identifying trusted social services and making cardiovascular health a priority. Findings suggested that CVD risk factors could be more effectively addressed in combination with attending to other pressing needs related to employment, housing, behavioral health, and building trust. Participants suggested that a smartphone app would be most useful if it broadly addressed these issues by linking returning citizens to social services, including recommendations from peers, and facilitating access to healthcare. Discussion: Returning citizens need broad support for societal reintegration. Addressing social issues would allow them to focus on cardiovascular health. Conclusion: Given the challenges experienced after release from incarceration, an app focused on social and health-access issues may help returning citizens meet their CVD needs.

AB  - Objective: To reduce pathogen exposure, conserve personal protective equipment, and facilitate health care personnel work participation in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, three affiliated institutions rapidly and independently deployed inpatient telemedicine programs during March 2020. We describe key features and early learnings of these programs in the hospital setting. Methods: Relevant clinical and operational leadership from an academic medical center, pediatric teaching hospital, and safety net county health system met to share learnings shortly after deploying inpatient telemedicine. A summative analysis of their learnings was re-circulated for approval. Results: All three institutions faced pressure to urgently standup new telemedicine systems while still maintaining secure information exchange. Differences across patient demographics and technological capabilities led to variation in solution design, though key technical considerations were similar. Rapid deployment in each system relied on readily available consumer-grade technology, given the existing familiarity to patients and clinicians and minimal infrastructure investment. Preliminary data from the academic medical center over one month suggested positive adoption with 631 inpatient video calls lasting an average (standard deviation) of 16.5 minutes (19.6) based on inclusion criteria. Discussion: The threat of an imminent surge of COVID-19 patients drove three institutions to rapidly develop inpatient telemedicine solutions. Concurrently, federal and state regulators temporarily relaxed restrictions that would have previously limited these efforts. Strategic direction from executive leadership, leveraging off-the-shelf hardware, vendor engagement, and clinical workflow integration facilitated rapid deployment. Conclusion: The rapid deployment of inpatient telemedicine is feasible across diverse settings as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Background and Objective: Clinical decision support tools for risk prediction are readily available, but typically require workflow interruptions and manual data entry so are rarely used. Due to new data interoperability standards for electronic health records (EHRs), other options are available. As a clinical case study, we sought to build a scalable, web-based system that would automate calculation of kidney failure risk and display clinical decision support to users in primary care practices. Materials and Methods: We developed a single-page application, web server, database, and application programming interface to calculate and display kidney failure risk. Data were extracted from the EHR using the Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture interoperability standard for Continuity of Care Documents (CCDs). EHR users were presented with a noninterruptive alert on the patient's summary screen and a hyperlink to details and recommendations provided through a web application. Clinic schedules and CCDs were retrieved using existing application programming interfaces to the EHR, and we provided a clinical decision support hyperlink to the EHR as a service. Results: We debugged a series of terminology and technical issues. The application was validated with data from 255 patients and subsequently deployed to 10 primary care clinics where, over the course of 1 year, 569 533 CCD documents were processed. Conclusions: We validated the use of interoperable documents and open-source components to develop a lowcost tool for automated clinical decision support. Since Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture-based data extraction extends to any certified EHR, this demonstrates a successful modular approach to clinical decision support.

AB  - In March of 1997, the National Research Council (NRC) of the National Academy of Sciences issued the report, "For the Record: Protecting Electronic Health Information." Concluding that the current practices at the majority of health care facilities in the United States are insufficient, the Council delineated both technical and organizational approaches to protecting electronic health information. The Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center recently implemented a proof-of-concept, Web-based, cross-institutional medical record, CareWeb, which incorporates the NRC security and confidentiality recommendations. We report on our WWW implementation of the NRC recommendations and an initial evaluation of the balance between ease of use and confidentiality.

AB  - Background There is growing interest in the use of technology to enhance the tracking and quality of clinical information available for patients in disaster settings. This paper describes the design and evaluation of the Wireless Internet Information System for Medical Response in Disasters (WIISARD). Materials and methods WIISARD combined advanced networking technology with electronic triage tags that reported victims' position and recorded medical information, with wireless pulse-oximeters that monitored patient vital signs, and a wireless electronic medical record (EMR) for disaster care. The EMR system included WiFi handheld devices with barcode scanners (used by front-line responders) and computer tablets with role-tailored software (used by managers of the triage, treatment, transport and medical communications teams). An additional software system provided situational awareness for the incident commander. The WIISARD system was evaluated in a large-scale simulation exercise designed for training first responders. A randomized trial was overlaid on this exercise with 100 simulated victims, 50 in a control pathway (paper-based), and 50 in completely electronic WIISARD pathway. All patients in the electronic pathway were cared for within the WIISARD system without paperbased workarounds. Results WIISARD reduced the rate of the missing and/or duplicated patient identifiers (0% vs 47%, p<0.001). The total time of the field was nearly identical (38:20 vs 38:23, IQR 26:53-1:05:32 vs 18:55-57:22). Conclusion Overall, the results of WIISARD show that wireless EMR systems for care of the victims of disasters would be complex to develop but potentially feasible to build and deploy, and likely to improve the quality of information available for the delivery of care during disasters.

AB  - Learning in the cellular phone environment enables utilizing the multiple functions of the cellular phone, such as mobility, availability, interactivity, verbal and voice communication, taking pictures or recording audio and video, measuring time and transferring information. These functions together with mathematics-designated cellular phone applications facilitate authentic learning based on real-life phenomena, and widen the range of mathematical activities possible to carry out. This research shows that the cellular phone provides the mathematics students with rich, diverse and colourful learning environment in and out of the classroom. The participating students worked with the cellular phone to carry out activities involving formal mathematical phenomena and at the same time authentic real-life phenomena which they modelled mathematically. Doing so, they worked individually and collaboratively with diverse, specific and general mathematical concepts and at the same time practiced specific and general mathematical procedures, which expanded their mathematical knowledge and meta-knowledge. The cellular phone enabled the students to work with various representations of mathematical objects which encouraged them to investigate these objects independently or with the guidance of their teacher. The students also could tackle advanced mathematical objects intuitively based on their visual representation and actual realization in real-life situations. © The Author 2011.

AB  - Objective: An evaluation of Internet end-to-end performance was conducted for the purpose of better understanding the overall performance of Internet pathways typical of those used to access information in National Library of Medicine (NLM) databases and, by extension, other Internet-based biomedical information resources. Design: The evaluation used a three-level test strategy: 1) user testing to collect empirical data on Internet performance as perceived by users when accessing NLM Web-based databases, 2) technical testing to analyze the Internet paths between the NLM and the user's desktop computer terminal, and 3) technical testing between the NLM and the World Wide Web ('Web') server computer at the user's institution to help characterize the relative performance of Internet pathways. Measurements: Time to download the front pages of NLM Web sites and conduct standardized searches of NLM databases, data transmission capacity between NLM and remote locations (known as the bulk transfer capacity [BTC]), 'ping' round-trip time as an indication of the latency of the network pathways, and the network routing of the data transmissions (number and sequencing of hops). Results: Based on 347 user tests spread over 16 locations, the median time per location to download the main NLM home page ranged from 2 to 59 seconds, and 1 to 24 seconds for the other NLM Web sites tested. The median time to conduct standardized searches and get search results ranged from 2 to 14 seconds for PubMed and 4 to 18 seconds for Internet Grateful Med. The overall problem rate was about 1 percent; that is, on the average, users experienced a problem once every 100 test measurements. The user terminal tests at five locations and Web host tests at 13 locations provided profiles of BTC, RTT, and network routing for both dial-up and fixed Internet connections. Conclusion: The evaluation framework provided a profile of typical Internet performance and insights into network performance and time- of-day/day-of-week variability. This profile should serve as a frame of reference to help identify and diagnose connectivity problems and should contribute to the evolving concept of Internet quality of service.

AB  - Objective: The World Wide Web (WWW) is a new communications medium that permits investigators to contact patients in nonmedical settings and study the effects of disease on quality of life through self-administered questionnaires. However, little is known about the feasibility and, what is more important, the validity of this approach. An on-line survey for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and patients whose UC had been treated with surgical procedures was developed. To understand how patients on the WWW might differ from those in practice and the potential biases in conducting epidemiological research in volunteers recruited on the Internet, post-surgery patients who responded to the WWW survey were compared with those in a surgical practice. Setting: The Internet and private practice surgical clinic. Main outcomes: Scores from the Short form 36 (SF-36) Health Assessment Questionnaire and the Self-Administered Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ). Results: Over a 5-month period, 53 post-surgery patients enrolled in the Internet study; 47 patients from a surgical clinic completed the same computer-based questionnaire. Surgically treated patients on the WWW were younger than their clinic counterparts (median age category 35-44 years vs. 45-54 years, p = 0.01) but more ill with a lower summary IBDQ score (168 vs. 186, p = 0.019) and lower health status across almost all dimensions of the SF-36 (p = 0.016). Conclusions: It is feasible to conduct epidemiological research on the effects of UC on quality of life on the Web; however, systematic differences in disease activity between volunteer patients on the WWW and "in the clinic" may limit the applicability of results.

AB  - Objective The high level of stress associated with caring for others with medical conditions has been recognized for some time. Reducing caregiver stress can improve caregiver quality of life as well as improve the care they provide to loved ones. This systematic review assesses the effectiveness of internet-based interventions to decrease caregiver stress. Materials and methods A comprehensive literature search of Ovid MEDLINE (1946-2013), Embase (1988-2013), PsycINFO (1987-2013), and CINAHL was conducted using terms related to caregiver and internet-based interventions. Internet-based interventions involving informal caregivers in an open-label or randomized controlled trial setting were included. A pair of raters independently reviewed all published abstracts. Data regarding participants, interventions, and outcomes were extracted and, for randomized trials, methodology quality was also reviewed. Results Eight open-label trials met the review criteria: three showed positive benefit in reducing caregiver stress, four were partially positive (some outcomes positive, others negative), and one was a negative study. Sixteen randomized trials met the review criteria: six showed positive benefit, five were partially positive, and five were negative. There were no clear patterns as to the variables (such as study duration and complexity of intervention) associated with better outcomes, although earlier studies typically had more negative outcomes. Discussion Internet-based interventions were mostly effective in reducing aspects of caregiver stress and improving their well-being. Further studies to assess outcomes for caregivers and their recipients' health, different technology delivery methods, and the cost of such interventions are needed.

AB  - Web tracking is a commonly-used practice on the Internet devoted to retrieve user information for activities such as personalization or advertisement. These techniques are said to drive the web economy, although they are commonly used to invade users' privacy. In the last years, a general concern raised about web tracking, looking forward to combat it in many ways like regulations, anti-tracking methods and even standardization. In this paper, we analyze and discuss the current techniques for web-tracking as well as techniques for its detection and analysis, and countermeasures to prevent web tracking.

AB  - Mobile health (mHealth) customers shopping for applications (apps) should be aware of app privacy practices so they can make informed decisions about purchase and use. We sought to assess the availability, scope, and transparency of mHealth app privacy policies on iOS and Android. Over 35 000 mHealth apps are available for iOS and Android. Of the 600 most commonly used apps, only 183 (30.5%) had privacy policies. Average policy length was 1755 (SD 1301) words with a reading grade level of 16 (SD 2.9). Two thirds (66.1%) of privacy policies did not specifically address the app itself. Our findings show that currently mHealth developers often fail to provide app privacy policies. The privacy policies that are available do not make information privacy practices transparent to users, require college-level literacy, and are often not focused on the app itself. Further research is warranted to address why privacy policies are often absent, opaque, or irrelevant, and to find a remedy.

AB  - Objective: To better understand the relationship between online health-seeking behaviors and in-world healthcare utilization (HU) by studies of online search and access activities before and after queries that pursue medical professionals and facilities. Materials and methods We analyzed data collected from logs of online searches gathered from consenting users of a browser toolbar from Microsoft (N=9740). We employed a complementary survey (N=489) to seek a deeper understanding of information-gathering, reflection, and action on the pursuit of professional healthcare. Results: We provide insights about HU through the survey, breaking out its findings by different respondent marginalizations as appropriate. Observations made from search logs may be explained by trends observed in our survey responses, even though the user populations differ. Discussion: The results provide insights about how users decide if and when to utilize healthcare resources, and how online health information seeking transitions to in-world HU. The findings from both the survey and the logs reveal behavioral patterns and suggest a strong relationship between search behavior and HU. Although the diversity of our survey respondents is limited and we cannot be certain that users visited medical facilities, we demonstrate that it may be possible to infer HU from long-term search behavior by the apparent influence that health concerns and professional advice have on search activity. Conclusions: Our findings highlight different phases of online activities around queries pursuing professional healthcare facilities and services. We also show that it may be possible to infer HU from logs without tracking people's physical location, based on the effect of HU on pre- and post-HU search behavior. This allows search providers and others to develop more robust models of interests and preferences by modeling utilization rather than simply the intention to utilize that is expressed in search queries.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We conduct a first large-scale analysis of mobile health (mHealth) apps available on Google Play with the goal of providing a comprehensive view of mHealth apps' security features and gauging the associated risks for mHealth users and their data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We designed an app collection platform that discovered and downloaded more than 20 000 mHealth apps from the Medical and Health & Fitness categories on Google Play. We performed a suite of app code and traffic measurements to highlight a range of app security flaws: certificate security, sensitive or unnecessary permission requests, malware presence, communication security, and security-related concerns raised in user reviews. RESULTS: Compared to baseline non-mHealth apps, mHealth apps generally adopt more reliable signing mechanisms and request fewer dangerous permissions. However, significant fractions of mHealth apps expose users to serious security risks. Specifically, 1.8% of mHealth apps package suspicious codes (eg, trojans), 45.0% rely on unencrypted communication, and as much as 23.0% of personal data (eg, location information and passwords) is sent on unsecured traffic. An analysis of the app reviews reveals that mHealth app users are largely unaware of the surfaced security issues. CONCLUSION: Despite being better aligned with security best practices than non-mHealth apps, mHealth apps are still far from ensuring robust security guarantees. App users, clinicians, technology developers, and policy makers alike should be cognizant of the uncovered security issues and weigh them carefully against the benefits of mHealth apps.

AB  - Objective Many mobile phone resources have been developed to increase access to health education in the developing world, yet few studies have compared these resources or quantified their performance in a resourcelimited setting. This study aims to compare the performance of resident physicians in answering clinical scenarios using PubMed abstracts accessed via the PubMed for Handhelds (PubMed4Hh) website versus medical/drug reference applications (Medical Apps) accessed via software on the mobile phone. Methods A two-arm comparative study with crossover design was conducted. Subjects, who were resident physicians at the University of Botswana, completed eight scenarios, each with multi-part questions. The primary outcome was a grade for each question. The primary independent variable was the intervention arm and other independent variables included residency and question. Results Within each question type there were significant differences in 'percentage correct' between Medical Apps and PubMed4Hh for three of the six types of questions: drug-related, diagnosis/definitions, and treatment/management. Within each of these question types, Medical Apps had a higher percentage of fully correct responses than PubMed4Hh (63% vs 13%, 33% vs 12%, and 41% vs 13%, respectively). PubMed4Hh performed better for epidemiologic questions. Conclusions While mobile access to primary literature remains important and serves an information niche, mobile applications with condensed content may be more appropriate for point-of-care information needs. Further research is required to examine the specific information needs of clinicians in resource-limited settings and to evaluate the appropriateness of current resources in bridging location- and context-specific information gaps.

AB  - The Internet is rapidly evolving from a resource used primarily by the research community to a true global information network offering a wide range of databases and services. This evolution presents many opportunities for improved access to biomedical information, but Internet-based resources have often been difficult for the non-expert to develop and use. The World Wide Web (WWW) supports an inexpensive, easy-to-use, cross-platform, graphic interface to the Internet that may radically alter the way we retrieve and disseminate medical data. This paper summarizes the Internet and hypertext origins of the WWW, reviews WWW-specific technologies, and describes current and future applications of this technology in medicine and medical informatics.

AB  - Consenting visitors to a health survey Web site were randomly assigned to a "matrix" presentation or an "expanded" presentation of survey response options. Among 4,208 visitors to the site over 3 months, 1,615 (38 percent) participated by giving consent and completing the survey. During a pre-trial period, when consent was not required, 914 of 1,667 visitors (55 percent) participated (odds ratio 1.9, P < 0.0001). Mean response times were 5.07 minutes for the matrix format and 5.22 minutes for the expanded format (P = 0.16). Neither health status scores nor alpha reliability coefficients were substantially influenced by the survey format, but health status scores varied with age and gender as expected from U.S. population norms. In conclusion, presenting response options in a matrix format may not substantially speed survey completion. This study demonstrates a method for rapidly evaluating interface design alternatives using anonymous Web volunteers who have provided informed consent.

The authors reviewed published guidelines for the design of Web-based clinical systems for elderly patients and identified additional design considerations that have not been reported in the literature. The resulting recommendations are related to the system interface, the training and support of users, and the content of Web pages. The recommendations can be used as design objectives for Web-based systems for elderly patients, which emphasize system usability and aim to optimize patients' error-free use of these systems.

AB  - Background Adherence to medications for treating alcohol use disorder (AUD) is poor. To identify predictors of daily naltrexone adherence over time, a secondary data analysis was conducted of a trial evaluating a mobile health intervention to improve adherence. Methods Participants seeking treatment for AUD (n = 58; Mage = 38 years; 71% male) were prescribed naltrexone for 8 weeks. Adherence was tracked using the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS). In response to daily text messages, participants reported the previous day's alcohol use, craving, and naltrexone side effects. Using multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM), we examined baseline dispositional factors and within-person, time-varying factors as predictors of daily adherence. Results Naltrexone adherence decreased over time. Adherence was higher on days when individuals completed daily mobile assessments relative to days when they did not (odds ratio [OR] = 2.53, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.61 to 3.98), irrespective of intervention condition. Days when individuals drank more than their typical amount were related to lower next-day adherence (OR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.99). A similar pattern was supported for craving (OR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.98). Weekend days were associated with lower adherence than weekdays (OR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.86); this effect was partly mediated by heavier daily drinking (indirect effect = -0.02, 95% CI -0.04 to -0.003) and stronger-than-usual craving (indirect effect = -0.01, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.00) on weekend days. Conclusions The results further demonstrate the need to improve adherence to AUD pharmacotherapy. The present findings also support developing interventions that target daily-level risk factors for nonadherence. Mobile health interventions may be one means of developing tailored and adaptive adherence interventions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance and test-retest reliability obtained when  administering a computerized baseline neurocognitive exam to NCAA Division I student-athletes in a controlled laboratory setting versus an uncontrolled remote location. METHOD: A sample of 129 (female = 100) Division I student-athletes completed Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT) pre-season assessments for two distinct and respective sports seasons in a controlled laboratory environment and an uncontrolled remote environment. Depending on the environment, participants were given verbal (controlled) or written (uncontrolled) guidelines for taking the test. RESULTS: Multivariate repeated-measures ANOVA's determined that there were no within-subject differences between testing environments on ImPACT composite scores and cognitive efficiency index (CEI). The Chi-square test did not find any significant differences in impulse control or the number of invalid test scores, as determined by ImPACT, between environments. Intraclass correlations found the ImPACT subtest scores to range in test-retest reliability across testing environments, demonstrating moderate (verbal memory composite, r = 0.46; visual memory composite, r = 0.64; reaction time, r = 0.61; impulse control, r = 0.52; and CEI, r = 0.61) and good (visual motor composite, r = 0.77) test-retest reliability. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that ImPACT is reliable between controlled and uncontrolled testing environments. This further suggests that ImPACT can be administered in a remote environment, pending specific adherence to testing instructions, or in the event of social distancing or isolation policies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) is  widely used in research and clinical settings. However, little is known about the use of the CANTAB in the local aging context. This study aimed to develop normative data for various CANTAB measures in community-living older adults in Singapore. Normative data were built using the regression-based approach. A secondary aim was to examine the concurrent validity of CANTAB measures with their traditional neurocognitive test counterparts. METHOD: A total of 210 older adults (Mage = 67.27 years, SD = 5.45) from an existing cohort study completed standard neurocognitive tests and a CANTAB battery. A total of 160 were normal aging, 46 diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and one diagnosed with Dementia. Older adults with MCI and Dementia were not included in the calculation of norms but were included in other analyses. For the CANTAB battery, regression-based norms were generated for each CANTAB measure, with age, sex, and education included as covariates. Concurrent validity was examined by correlating the CANTAB measures with their traditional neurocognitive counterparts. RESULTS: As expected, performance across most CANTAB measures declined significantly with increasing age and decreasing education levels. There were no significant effects of sex on most CANTAB measures. Our study also showed that some CANTAB measures demonstrated good concurrent validity as they significantly correlated with their traditional neurocognitive test counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed age, sex, and education-specific CANTAB norms for use in the local aging context. The advantages and challenges of using the CANTAB in the local aging context are discussed.

AB  - Computerized neuropsychological assessment has integrated slowly into research and practice since the introduction of the personal computer. Though initial integration of technology to the laboratory and clinical setting utilized specialized hardware and software, newer generation assessment tools are integrated with "off-the-shelf" operating systems. Further, neuropsychological assessment is beginning to find Internet-based application for remote assessment. As these applications are more broadly applied, it is essential to understand potential errors that can be created both in test administration and in reaction time measurement due to hardware and software interactions. In this article, user considerations are specifically addressed for resident and Internet-enabled assessment software. Potential hardware and software conflicts are defined and potential remediation is suggested. Computerized assessment is a valuable tool for neuropsychologists as long as it is used responsibly with an understanding of the potential technical complications. © 2006 National Academy of Neuropsychology.

AB  - Background: Psychosocial stress contributes to heart disease in part by adversely affecting maintenance of health behaviors, while exercise can reduce stress. Assessing the bi-directional relationship between stress and exercise has been limited by lack of real-time data and theoretical and statistical models. This lack may hinder efforts to promote exercise maintenance. Purpose: We test the bi-directional relationship between stress and exercise using real-time data for the average person and the variability—individual differences—in this relationship. Methods: An observational study was conducted within a single cohort randomized controlled experiment. Healthy young adults, (n = 79) who reported only intermittent exercise, completed 12 months of stress monitoring by ecological momentary assessment (at the beginning of, end of, and during the day) and continuous activity monitoring by Fitbit. A random coefficients linear mixed model was used to predict end-of-day stress from the occurrence/non-occurrence of exercise that day; a logistic mixed model was used to predict the occurrence/non-occurrence of exercise from ratings of anticipated stress. Separate regression analyses were also performed for each participant. Sensitivity analysis tested all models, restricted to the first 180 days of observation (prior to randomization). Results: We found a significant average inverse (i.e., negative) effect of exercise on stress and of stress on exercise. There was significant between-person variability. Of N = 69, exercise was associated with a stress reduction for 15, a stress increase for 2, and no change for the remainder. We also found that an increase in anticipated stress reported the previous night or that morning was associated with a significant 20–22% decrease (OR = 0.78–0.80) in the odds of exercising that day. Of N = 69, this increase in stress reduced the likelihood of exercise for 17, increased the odds for 1, and had no effect for the remainder. We were unable to identify psychosocial factors that moderate the individual differences in these effects. Conclusions: The relationship of stress to exercise can be uni- or bi-directional and varies from person to person. A precision medicine approach may improve exercise uptake.

AB  - The popular #fitspiration trend on Instagram and other social media platforms is intended to inspire healthy living (particularly exercise engagement), though several studies have documented the negative effects of fitspiration-style posts on women's body satisfaction and mood. Pairing fitspiration images with text focused on self-compassion shows promise for buffering this effect and warrants additional attention. In particular, little is known about the benefit of self-compassion (vs. traditional) messaging for exercise motivation or engagement, and few studies have examined gender differences in these effects. The present study used an experimental design to test the differential effects of fitspiration posts paired with traditional messaging, self-compassion messaging, or no text (image-only control). College students (N = 655; 59% women, 64% Caucasian) were randomized to view gender-congruent stimuli on Instagram; they then completed self-report measures of body satisfaction and exercise motivation, and their attendance at campus fitness centers was tracked over the following 7 days (to capture exercise engagement). Neither the expected benefits of self-compassion (vs. traditional) messages for body satisfaction and exercise motivation nor the expected benefit of traditional (vs. self-compassion) messages for exercise engagement were observed. However, results of exploratory analyses suggest that, as predicted, self-compassion messaging may be optimal for promoting positive outcomes among women, whereas images without associated text may be optimal for promoting positive outcomes among men (Cohen's ds = 0.14-0.41). Findings from this study provide insight into potential methods for optimizing the fitspiration trend to promote healthy self-perceptions and exercise engagement during college.

AB  - Maternal and infant health (MIH) mobile applications (apps) are increasingly popular and frequently used for health education and decision making. Interventions grounded in theory-based behavior change techniques (BCTs) are shown to be effective in promoting healthy behavior changes. MIH apps have the potential to be useful tools, yet the extent to which they incorporate BCTs is still unknown. The objective of this study was to assess the presence of BCTs in popular MIH apps available in the Apple App and Google Play stores. Twenty-nine popular MIH apps were coded for the presence of 16 BCTs using the mHealth app taxonomy. Popular MIH apps whose purpose was to provide health education or decision-making support to pregnant women or parents/caregivers of infants were included in the final sample. On an average, the reviewed apps included seven BCTs (range 2-16). Techniques such as personalization, review of general or specific goals, macro tailoring, self-monitoring of goals, and health behavior linkages were most frequently present. No differences in the presence of BCTs between paid and free apps were observed. Popular MIH apps typically included only a minority of BCTs found to be useful for health promotion. However, apps developed by healthcare developers incorporated a higher number of BCTs within the app content. Therefore, app developers and policymakers may consider strategies to increase health expert involvement in app design and content delivery.

AB  - Engaging in positive healthy lifestyle behaviors continues to be a public health challenge, requiring innovative solutions. As the market for voice assistants (Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple Siri) grows and people increasingly use them to assist their daily tasks, there is a pressing need to explore how voice assistant (VA) technology may be used in behavioral health interventions. A scoping review of literature was conducted to address a PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) question: across populations, how does the use of voice assistants in behavioral health research/ interventions influence healthy lifestyle behaviors versus control or comparison interventions? To inform the science, a secondary aim of this review was to explore characteristics of VAs used in behavioral health research. The review was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines with scoping review extension (PRISMA-ScR). Ten studies satisfied the inclusion criteria, representing research published through February 2019. Studies spanned pediatric to elderly populations, covering a vast array of self-management and healthy lifestyle behaviors. The majority of interventions were multicomponent, involving more than one of the following behavior change techniques grouped by cluster: shaping knowledge, self-belief, repetition and substitution, feedback and monitoring, goals and planning, antecedents, natural consequences, comparison of behavior, and identification. However, most studies were in early stages of development, with limited efficacy trials. VA technology continues to evolve and support behavioral interventions using various platforms (e.g., Interactive Voice Response [IVR] systems, smartphones, and smart speakers) which are used alone or in conjunction with other platforms. Feasibility, usability, preliminary efficacy, along with high user satisfaction of research adapted VAs, in contrast to standalone commercially available VAs, suggest a role for VAs in behavioral health intervention research.

AB  - Study of Health and Activity in Preschool Environments (SHAPES) aimed to increase preschoolers' physical activity by engaging preschool teachers in professional development designed to modify instructional practices. SHAPES originated as a randomized controlled trial, tested in 16 preschools and disseminated to 4 control schools, and was shown to be effective in increasing preschool children's physical activity (Phase I, 2008-2012). This article describes the steps taken to translate an evidence-based physical activity intervention, SHAPES, from in-person delivery to online delivery of professional development to preschool teachers. In Phase II (2013-2016), professional development delivery was modified from an in-person to an online program for preschool teachers. Teacher implementation completeness and fidelity were examined in 10 pilot preschools and then replicated in 30 preschools. Large-scale dissemination of SHAPES began in Phase III (2017-2019), reaching 818 teachers from 228 unique centers after 2 years. The final SHAPES program consisted of six online modules, an accompanying guidebook, over 90 activities, self-assessment techniques, a video library, and an electronic community forum. The SHAPES core elements, defined in Phase I, were retained throughout all three phases. The Phase II change to online delivery was characterized by high levels of implementation completeness and fidelity. Results of Phase III statewide dissemination revealed comparable implementation completeness and fidelity. An intervention shown to be effective in a randomized controlled trial can be translated into an online professional development program and disseminated on a large scale in a timely manner.

AB  - Trial settings that include proactive recruitment, human contact, and assessment procedures may substantially impact the way users engage with unguided e-mental health programs and the generalizability of reported findings. This study examined the impact of trial setting on user behavior by directly comparing reported user engagement in trial-based research and objective measures of real-world usage of the same unguided mental health programs. The authors conducted a systematic search for papers reporting user engagement with off-the-shelf unguided e-mental health programs. Real-world usage was obtained from a panel that presents aggregated nonpersonal information on user engagement with digital programs across the world. A total of 13 papers yielding 14 comparable usage metrics met all inclusion criteria. In three papers reporting the use of programs by lay users without any proactive trial procedures, the ratios calculated by dividing the usage reported in the paper by the usage documented within the objective dataset were 0.84, 1.05, and 1.27-suggesting a sufficient criterion validity for our examination. In studies that proactively recruited users and included pre-to post-assessment procedures (11 comparisons), the median program usage rate reported was 4.06 times higher (IQR = 4.49) than the real-world usage of the same program. Severity of clinical symptoms, in-person versus remote assessment procedures, study design, and program cost had no impact on these differences. The results suggest that trial settings have a large impact on user engagement with unguided interventions and, therefore, on the generalizability of the findings to the real world.

AB  - Due to the high burden of depression, new models and methods of mental healthcare need to be developed. Prior research has shown the potential benefits of using technology tools such as mobile apps as self-help or combined with psychological treatment. Therefore, professionals should acquaint themselves with evidence-based apps to be able to use them with clients and guide the clients in their use. The purpose of this study was to explore how an acceptance and commitment therapy-based mobile app was perceived as a self-management tool among nurses, and how it could be applied in the prevention and treatment of depression and other mental health issues. Sixteen Finnish nurses undergoing depression nurse specialist education used the app for 5 weeks and participated in semistructured focus group interviews. Interviews were analyzed by qualitative content analysis. In general, the nurses found the app suitable as a self-management tool and identified three models of using it in clinical practice. Having used the app personally, the nurses were eager to take it into use with various client groups, especially in occupational health but also in the treatment of mental health problems. However, they also raised concerns about the effort needed in familiarizing oneself with the content and pointed out specific client groups for whom the benefits of the app should be carefully weighed against the potential risks. Despite the small sample size, the findings suggest that involving technology tools as part of the nurses’ education could ease their adoption in clinical practice. The degree of professional support in the app use should be aligned to the severity of the mental health problems.

AB  - The Internet is a rich multimodal communication environment where researchers can often recruit large numbers of participants for survey studies at low cost; however, there are many unanswered questions about the use of this technology in medical research. An important question is whether the results obtained in such surveys are generalizable to other populations. In this article, we describe different approaches for recruitment of participants on the Internet and how specific approaches may limit generalizability. Another issue clouding use of the Web in research is the essential anonymity of participants. We discuss the risk and benefits of anonymous surveys and technical methods that minimize the risks while preserving anonymity and confidentiality. A related problem may be accidental or deliberate enrollment of unqualified individuals in studies. Researchers can use survey design and statistical methods described herein to partially address threats to validity arising from such individuals; however, in some situations, confirmation of eligibility, by manual review of medical records, may be necessary.

AB  - Parametric methods are recognized as a very useful tool for reusing code and augmenting the expressiveness of an object-oriented language providing parametric classes. This paper focuses on their implementation techniques for Java. Existing proposals for extending Java with parametric polymorphism are outlined, showing and discussing the basic implementation techniques: type-erasure, code-expansion and type-passing. Up until now, only type-erasure and code-expansion have been exploited for the implementation of parametric methods, but they suffer from some problems. Basically, type-erasure is unable to support parametric types at run-time, while code-expansion generally leads to significant increase of both disk and memory overhead. The main goal of this paper is to study a type-passing approach aimed at tackling these issues. This is based on the management of method descriptors, which are objects passed to the method bodies at invocation-time, and which carry information on the instantiation of the method's type parameters. Run-time efficiency is guaranteed thanks to a special treatment of descriptors deferring their creation at load-time. Dynamic dispatching of method calls is supported by exploiting a data structure called the Virtual Parametric Methods Table, resembling Virtual Methods Tables of C++. The approach here presented turns out to be a significant alternative to the existing proposals for implementing generics in Java, supporting parametric types at run-time without unnecessary code footprint.

AB  - The organisation of actual design activities, even by experts involved in routine tasks, is not appropriately characterised by the retrieval of pre-existing plans, but is opportunistic (possibly with hierarchical episodes at a local level, but not globally hierarchical). Actually executed design actions depend, at each moment t, on the evaluation of actions proposed at t−1. These proposals can be made by pre-established plans, but also by other action-proposal knowledge structures. This position is supported by results from diverse empirical design studies. A major reason why design activities are organised opportunisically is that, even if designers possess plans which they may retrieve and use, the designers very often deviate from these plans so that their activities satisfy action-management constraints, of which the most important is cognitive economy. Two types of variables underlying this opportunism are discussed: situational and processing. © 1994 Butterworth-Heinemann Ltd.

AB  - A framework for constructing a cognitive model of users' information searching behaviour is described. The motivation for the framework is to create explanatory and predictive theories of information searching to improve the design of information retrieval (IR) systems. The framework proposes a taxonomy of components for process models of the information seeking task, information need types and knowledge sources necessary to support the task. The framework is developed into a preliminary version of a cognitive theory of information searching by the addition of strategies and correspondence rules which predict user behaviour in different task stages according to information need types, facilities provided by the IR system and knowledge held by the user. The theory is evaluated by using claims analysis based on empirical observations of users information retrieval and by a walkthrough of an IR session to investigate how well the theory can account for empirical evidence. Results show that the theory can indicate the expert strategies which should be followed in different task contexts but predictions of actual user behaviour are less accurate. The future possibilities for employing the theoretical model as a tutorial advisor for information retrieval and as an evaluation method for IR systems are reviewed. The role and potential of cognitive theories of user task-action in Information Retrieval and Human Computer Interaction are discussed. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Text elision is a user interface technique that aims to improve the efficiency of navigating through information by allowing regions of text to be 'folded' into and out of the display. Several researchers have argued that elision interfaces are particularly suited to source code editing because they allow programmers to focus on relevant code regions while suppressing the display of irrelevant information. Elision features are now appearing in commercial systems for software development. There is, however, a lack of empirical evidence of the technique's efficiency. This paper presents an empirical evaluation of source code elision using a Java program editor. The evaluation compared a normal 'flat text' editor with two versions that diminished elided text to levels that were 'just legible' and 'illegible'. Performance was recorded in four tasks involving navigation through programs. Results show that programmers were able to complete their tasks more rapidly when using the elision interfaces, particularly in larger program files. Although several participants indicated a preference for the just legible elision interface, performance was best with illegible elision. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Dissatisfaction with the traditional model of HCI research borrowed from experimental psychology has lead to a number of interesting new approaches. One is the so-called 'hermeneutic approach' based on field research methods. Another is to apply existing theory from cognitive psychology. This paper is mainly concerned with a third discernible approach based around a study of the artifacts or inventions built to facilitate human-computer interaction. The effectiveness of different system features is explained by reference to the user's task. The investigation of 'observation-invention pairs' is suggested as a way of providing generalisations about user behaviour consistent with this approach. The observation part is a statement about the behaviour of users with some specified generality. The invention serves to illustrate the observation's implications for design and provides a heuristic for further inventions. The paper relates observation-invention pairs to other analyses of artifacts and concludes that they have a place as general statements of knowledge for HCI design. © 1991 Butterworth-Heinemann Ltd.

AB  - This paper identifies a number of factors involved in current practices of usability testing and presents profiles for three prototype methods: think-aloud, subjective ratings, and history files. We then identify ideal levels to generate the profile for new methods. These methods involve either a human observer or a self-administration of the test by the user. We propose methods of automating the evaluation form by dynamically adding items and modifying the form and the tasks in the process of the usability test. For self-administration of testing, we propose similar ideas of dynamically automating the forms and the tasks. Furthermore, we propose methods of eliciting the user's goals and focus of attention. Finally, we propose that user testing methods and interfaces should be subjected to usability testing. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Navigation in virtual environments on desktop systems is known to be problematic. Research into the usability of the tools presented on two-dimensional interfaces indicates that, for even relatively simple tasks, users experience some degree of frustration. As the user community broadens with an increasing range of applications and services making use of three-dimensional presentation, the usability of these interfaces becomes ever more important. In this paper, we describe the results of an experiment performed to evaluate the usability of a number of visual navigation tools and the effect for two age groups (18-45 and 46 +). Results indicate that, for both age groups, the visual presentation of navigational aids improves navigation performance in terms of both time taken to complete tasks, and user satisfaction with the system. In all experimental conditions younger participants achieved better performance times, although the gap between the groups decreased when a choice of navigation aids was presented. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we propose a process control model in Web-based e-Learning, and illustrate how to implement process control through learning path with workflow technology. This model improves the learning efficiency by providing instructors tools to design courses with learning paths and select the popular learning objects.

AB  - Motivation: Participants on the front lines of abuse reporting have a variety of options to notify intermediaries and resource owners about abuse of their systems and services. These can include emails to personal messages to blacklists to machine-generated feeds. Recipients of these reports have to voluntarily act on this information. We know remarkably little about the factors that drive higher response rates to abuse reports. One such factor is the reputation of the sender. In this article, we present the first randomized controlled experiment into sender reputation. We used a private datafeed of Asprox-infected websites to issue notifications from three senders with different reputations: an individual, a university and an established anti-malware organization. Results: We find that our detailed abuse reports significantly increase cleanup rates. Surprisingly, we find no evidence that sender reputation improves cleanup. We do see that the evasiveness of the attacker in hiding compromise can substantially hamper cleanup efforts. Furthermore, we find that the minority of hosting providers who viewed our cleanup advice webpage were much more likely to remediate infections than those who did not, but that website owners who viewed the advice fared no better.

AB  - In this paper we examine the problems of usability and related temporal issues in shared virtual environments. Shared virtual environments involve physically distributed users interacting with each other and with distributed objects via complex highly graphical user interfaces. These factors can result in interaction which suffers from serious and unpredictable delays in system response times. Careful interaction design can alleviate the problems resulting from such delays. We look at several areas of shared virtual world design, including object interaction, avatars and scene rendering, investigating ways of dealing with communicating information, preserving world coherence and providing users with effective real-time interaction. Our medium of analysis is the Extended User Action Notation (XUAN), a variant of the User Action Notation that enables us to express explicitly and clearly the temporal features of our examples. Finally, we discuss the implications of our temporal analysis for further research and development of shared virtual worlds, and the implications for the further development and use of XUAN.

AB  - As software systems have increased in complexity, manual testing has become harder or even infeasible. In addition, each test phase and application domain may have its idiosyncrasies in relation to testing automation. Techniques and tools to automate test oracles in domains such as graphical user interfaces are available; nevertheless, they are scarce in the virtual reality (VR) realm. We present an approach to automate software testing in VR-based systems with haptic interfaces - interfaces that allow bidirectional communication during human-computer interaction, capturing movements and providing touch feedback. It deals with the complexity and characteristics of haptic interfaces to apply the record and playback technique. Our approach also provides inference rules to identify possible faulty modules of the system under testing. A case study was performed with three systems: a system with primitive virtual objects, a dental anesthesia simulator and a game. Faulty versions of the systems were created by seeding faults manually and by using mutation operators. The results showed that 100% of the manually seeded faults and 93% of mutants were detected. Moreover, the inference rules helped identify the faulty modules of the systems, suggesting that the approach improves the test activity in VR-based systems with haptic interfaces.

AB  - A hypermedia system was introduced into an undergraduate biology curriculum in order to investigate the patterns of students' interaction with, and attitudes to such a system, both to develop the interface of the system itself, and to provide objective means of describing its usage in a real learning situation. This was seen as a prerequisite to any evaluation of actual learning outcomes. The paper describes the development process which involved not only the evolution of the system itself, but the construction and implementation of assessment tools. The use of these tools enabled the authors to draw a number of conclusions about the patterns of interaction that students demonstrated when given various learning tasks to carry out. Interactions were seen to be driven primarily by the task, rather than by any individual preferences on the part of the users. It is suggested that this may have important implications for the knowledge that users gain from hypermedia systems. © 1993 Butterworth-Heinemann Ltd.

AB  - Numerous studies have investigated task performance times for selection from hierarchical menus, with structures containing many choices at each of a few levels (broad, shallow structures) generally outperforming structures containing fewer choices at each of many levels (narrow, deep structures). To see if these results applied to blind users who rely on screen reader software for computer access, we replicated an earlier published study, using 19 blind screen-reader users. Consistent with earlier studies, broader, shallow hierarchies outperformed narrow, deep hierarchies. Task performance times and hypertext lostness measures were correlated. Although further work will be needed to understand specific determinants of task performance rates, these results support the use of broad, shallow menus for blind as well as sighted users. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Virtualization as one of the leading technologies has assisted datacenters to cloudify their products and provide versatile platforms and variety of Internet services. This technology also has facilitated agile deployment of complex Internet services such as Cloud-based multi-tier applications. However implementing multi-tier applications assists providers to set up flexible and scalable services, deploying such applications in virtualized environments faces challenges, which harden collocation of disparate multi-tier applications in a shared environment. In this article, we propose a placement strategy to consolidate multi-tier applications' tiers in a virtualized datacenter regarding workload demands of individual tiers, utilization of physical hosts' resources and operational status of virtual machines. The placement strategy identifies over-utilized hosts based on the birth- death stochastic process and ranks tiers based on Data Envelopment Analysis-Analytic Hierarchy Process modeling to be placed on target hosts. A prioritized tier will be placed on an appropriate host though least operational interference with hosted tiers incurred. The efficiency of the proposed model is evaluated using a series of in-depth experiments. We introduce results derived from quantitative and qualitative analyses that are useful for multi-tier applications placement in virtualized datacenters. Simulation results reveal that the proposed solution excels in terms of both load distribution and energy consumption in the datacenter, while the number of unnecessary migrations and consecutive Service Level Agreement violations is considerably reduced.

AB  - This paper describes an experiment which aims to examine the effectiveness and efficiency of a Virtual Reality Modelling Language (VRML) building model compared with equivalent architectural plans, for direction finding purposes. The effectiveness and efficiency issues being primarily investigated were number of tasks completed overall and task completion times. The experiment involved a series of tasks where participants had to find a number of locations/objects in a building unknown to them at the outset of the experiment. Statistically significant results are presented for the benefit of the research community, law enforcement officers and fire fighters where it is clear that in this context, the VRML model led to better task completions than the equivalent architectural plans. Regarding the task completion times, no statistical significance was found. Given the current climate of security issues and terrorist threats, it is important that law enforcement officers have at their disposal the best information possible regarding the layout of a building, whilst keeping costs down. This also applies to fire fighters when rescuing victims. This experiment has shown that a VRML model leads to better task completions in direction finding. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Folders are a commonplace metaphor in computing environments, constituting a link to physical work materials and are a key means for individuals to impose order on their digital work materials. This paper presents the findings of a novel qualitative study examining folder use by 12 information workers, using logging to accurately capture how folders were used in individual everyday work over 6 weeks, and challenging participants to work without using folders. Through observation and interviews, the study provides new descriptions of how folders are used and the dependence some study participants had on their folders to think and create, as well as to access files. The findings call into question whether search and recency-based lists of files could fulfil the functional role of folders, identified as key means for individuals to construct and specialize their work environments. Implications are discussed for document management tools, and more generally for operating system design.

AB  - Several experiments have documented how older adults have greater difficulty using input devices than young adults. None of these experiments, however, have provided information on the challenges faced by older adults when using pens to interact with handheld computers. To address this need, we conducted a study comparing the performance of twenty 18-22 year olds, twenty 50-64 year olds, and twenty 65-84 year olds conducting selection and steering tasks. We found that for the most part, older adults were able to complete tasks accurately and efficiently. An exception occurred with the low accuracy rates achieved by 65-84 year old participants when tapping on targets of the same size as the standard radio buttons on the PocketPC. An alternative selection technique we refer to as "touch" enabled 65-84 year olds to select targets significantly more accurately. If tapping to select, making standard-sized targets 50% larger provided 65-84 year olds with similar advantages to switching to "touch" interactions. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Electromyographic (EMG) signals play a key role in many clinical and biomedical applications. They can be used for identifying patients with muscular disabilities, assessing lower-back pain, kinesiology and motor control. There are three common applications of the EMG signal: (1) to determine the activation timing of the muscle; (2) to estimate the force produced by the muscle and (3) to analyze muscular fatigue through analysis of the frequency spectrum of the signal. We have developed an EMG tool that was incorporated in an existing web-based biosignal acquisition and processing framework. This tool can be used on a post-processing environment and provides not only frequency and time parameters, but also an automatic detection of starting and ending times for muscular voluntary contractions using a threshold-based algorithm with the inclusion of the Teager-Kaiser energy operator. The algorithm for the muscular voluntary contraction detection can also be reported after a real-Time acquisition, in order to discard possible outliers and simultaneously compare activation times in different muscles. This tool covers all known applications and allows a careful and detailed analysis of the EMG signal for both clinicians and researchers. The detection algorithm works without user interference and is also user-independent. It manages to detect muscular activations in an interactive process. The user simply has to select the signal's time interval as input, and the outcomes are provided afterwards.

AB  - This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of empirical research on object-oriented (OO) design. Many claims about the cognitive benefits of the OO paradigm have been made by its advocates. These claims concern the ease of designing and reusing software at the individual level as well as the benefits of this paradigm at the team level. Since these claims are cognitive in nature, it seems important to assess them empirically. After a brief presentation of the main concepts of the OO paradigm, the claims about the superiority of OO design are outlined. The core of this paper consists of a review of empirical studies of OO design (OOD). We first discuss results concerning OOD by individuals. On the basis of empirical work, we (1) analyse the design activity of novice OO designers, (2) compare OOD with procedural design and (3) discuss a typology of problems relevant for the OO approach. Then we assess the claims about naturalness and ease of OOD. The next part discusses results on OO software reuse. On the basis of empirical work, we (1) compare reuse in the OO versus the procedural paradigm, (2) discuss the potential for OO software reuse and (3) analyse reuse activity in the OO paradigm. Then we assess claims on reusability. The final part reviews empirical work on OOD by teams. We present results on communication, coordination, knowledge dissemination and interactions with clients. Then we assess claims about OOD at the software design team level. In a general conclusion, we discuss the limitations of these studies and give some directions for future research. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - As a result of the evolution in the field of biometrics, a new breed of techniques and methods for user identity recognition and verification has appeared based on the recognition and verification of several biometric features considered unique to each individual. Signature and voice characteristics, facial features, and iris and fingerprint patterns have all been used to identify a person or just to verify that the person is who he/she claims to be. Although still relatively new, these new technologies have already reached a level of development that allows its commercialization. However, there is a lack of studies devoted to the evaluation of these technologies from a user-centered perspective. This paper is intended to promote user-centered design and evaluation of biometric technologies. Towards this end, we have developed a platform to perform empirical evaluations of commercial biometric identity verification systems, including fingerprint, voice and signature verification. In this article, we present an initial empirical study in which we evaluate, compare and try to get insights into the factors that are crucial for the usability of these systems. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This exploratory experiment tested the effect of two virtual reality (VR) relaxation interventions on measures of physiological arousal and affect, compared to a control. Forty-nine participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions, all using the Oculus Rift. Participants wore a heart rate (HR) monitor and completed pre- and post-test surveys, including the positive and negative affect schedule, Likert-type and open feedback questions. Mixed repeated measures ANOVAs revealed significant reductions in HR and affect over time across all conditions, with a significant interaction identified for the breathing condition's effect on negative affect. Participants were able to identify feeling relaxation, as well as influencing factors. Further, the majority expected, and supported, the introduction of VR interventions in their workplace and/or college, with privacy being a common concern. These results demonstrate the potential of VR augmented relaxation interventions with recommendations for further study provided. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS: VR can potentially provide wellbeing interventions with a uniquely immersive quality Results suggest interactive and immersive VR experiences may facilitate relaxation and reduce stress Participants believe there may be substantial benefits to having VR wellbeing interventions at work and college.

AB  - Graphical interface use involves schemata operations that range from transfer to induction. The former apply existing knowledge, such as prior schemata, and are effortless, preconscious and intuitive. The latter, which consist in constructing new schemata, are resource-consuming and thus detrimental to intuitive use (IU). A quantitative method is proposed to manipulate and screen schemata operations at the level of an interface's states and features. Relevance for the design cycle of innovative interfaces is critically reviewed, and integration with existing intuitive-use design frameworks is proposed. These considerations are built upon instructional design studies suggesting that assessment should precede and inform the application of design techniques geared toward IU.

AB  - With the exponential growth of Internet technology, the notion of users' cognition when navigating such a vast information space has gained prominence. Studies suggest that metaphors can serve as effective tools to scaffold users' mental modeling processes. However, how users conceive of the metaphorical aid (as opposed to simply how they perceive it) remains questionable. Cognitive style, or the user's preferred way of information processing, has thus been posited as a possible factor affecting the success of the metaphorical approach in a hypermedia environment. This study explores the effects of visual metaphors and cognitive styles on users' learning performances in terms of structural knowledge and feelings of disorientation. The results indicate that a visual metaphor could improve the quality of mental formation, yet simultaneously increase users' mental load during navigation. In addition, cognitive style is a crucial factor that can significantly affect users' learning performance. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper describes a framework that serves as a reference for classifying user interfaces supporting multiple targets, or multiple contexts of use in the field of context-aware computing. In this framework, a context of use is decomposed into three facets: the end users of the interactive system, the hardware and software computing platform with which the users have to carry out their interactive tasks and the physical environment where they are working. Therefore, a context-sensitive user interface is a user interface that exhibits some capability to be aware of the context (context awareness) and to react to changes of this context. This paper attempts to provide a unified understanding of context-sensitive user interfaces rather than a prescription of various ways or methods of tackling different steps of development. Rather, the framework structures the development life cycle into four levels of abstraction: task and concepts, abstract user interface, concrete user interface and final user interface. These levels are structured with a relationship of reification going from an abstract level to a concrete one and a relationship of abstraction going from a concrete level to an abstract one. Most methods and tools can be more clearly understood and compared relative to each other against the levels of this framework. In addition, the framework expresses when, where and how a change of context is considered and supported in the context-sensitive user interface thanks to a relationship of translation. In the field of multi-target user interfaces is also introduced, defined, and exemplified the notion of plastic user interfaces. These user interfaces support some adaptation to changes of the context of use while preserving a predefined set of usability properties. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Novel data-mining tasks in e-science involve mining of distributed, highly heterogeneous data and knowledge sources. However, standard data mining platforms, such as Weka and Orange, involve only their own data mining algorithms in the process of knowledge discovery from local data sources. In contrast, next generation data mining technologies should enable processing of distributed data sources, the use of data mining algorithms implemented as web services, as well as the use of formal descriptions of data sources and knowledge discovery tools in the form of ontologies, enabling automated composition of complex knowledge discovery workflows for a given data mining task. This paper proposes a novel Service-oriented Knowledge Discovery framework and its implementation in a service-oriented data mining environment Orange4WS (Orange for Web Services), based on the existing Orange data mining toolbox and its visual programming environment, which enables manual composition of data mining workflows. The new service-oriented data mining environment Orange4WS includes the following new features: simple use of web services as remote components that can be included into a data mining workflow; simple incorporation of relational data mining algorithms; a knowledge discovery ontology to describe workflow components (data, knowledge and data mining services) in an abstract and machine-interpretable way, and its use by a planner that enables automated composition of data mining workflows. These new features are showcased in three real-world scenarios. © 2011 The Author. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The British Computer Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Malicious code attacks pose a serious threat to the security of information systems, as malware evolved from innocuous conceptual software to advanced and destructive cyber weapons. However, there is still the lack of a comprehensive and useful taxonomy to classify malware according to their behavior, since commonly used names are obsolete and unable to handle the complex and multipurpose currently observed samples. In this article, we present a brief survey on available malware taxonomies, discuss about issues on existing naming schemes and introduce an extensible taxonomy consisting of an initial set of behaviors usually exhibited by malware during an infection. The main goal of our proposed taxonomy is to address the menace of potentially malicious programs based on their observed behaviors, thus aiding in incident response procedures. Finally, we present a case study to evaluate our behavior-centric taxonomy, in which we apply identification patterns extracted from the proposed taxonomy to over 12 thousand known malware samples. The leveraged results show that it is possible to screen malicious programs that exhibit suspicious behaviors, even when they remain undetected by antivirus tools.

AB  - It is certain that cloud users are eager to ascertain where their sensitive data are stored. Misplacing the data probably divulges secret information. Therefore, researchers have designed mechanisms of geolocation of cloud data to allow cloud users to get geolocation of cloud data. However, to seek an approach to seeing through frauds is still a challenge. Trusted computing technology offers an alternative. The current study endeavors to construct the method through combining the technology with established geolocation techniques of Internet hosts thoroughly. Our work is complementary to Gondree and Peterson's recent contributions in which a constraint-based cloud data geolocation solution is present. The current scheme offers a strong validation of geolocation of cloud data, and can see through deceits. In the scheme, we leverage an un-clonable and tamper-proof device, Trusted Platform Module, which guarantees that cloud users can collect authentic geolocation evidences. We evaluate the original idea using a wide range of experiments. Results demonstrate that the scheme is feasible, and has a satisfactory performance in the city-level accuracy.

AB  - The representation and manipulation of sound within multimedia systems is an important and currently under-researched area. The paper gives an overview of the authors' work on the direct manipulation of audio information, and describes a solution based upon the navigation of four-dimensional scaled timbre spaces. Three hardware input devices were experimentally evaluated for use in a timbre space navigation task: the Apple Standard Mouse, Gravis Advanced Mousestick II joystick (absolute and relative) and the Nintendo Power Glove. Results show that the usability of these devices significantly affected the efficacy of the system, and that conventional low-cost, low-dimensional devices provided better performance than the low-cost, multidimensional dataglove.

AB  - With the emergence of flexible display technologies, it will be necessary for interface designers to move beyond flat interfaces and to contextualize interaction in an object's physical shape. Grounded in early explorations of organic user interfaces (OUIs), this paper examines the evolving relationship between industrial and interaction designs and examines how not only what we design is changing, but how we design too. First, we discuss how (and why) to better support the design of OUIs: how supporting sketching, a fundamental activity of many design fields, is increasingly critical and why a 'hypercontextualized' approach to their design can reduce the drawbacks met when everyday objects become interactive. Finally, underlying both these points is the maturation of technology to that of a computational material; when interactive hardware is seamlessly melded into an object's shape, the 'computer' disappears and is better seen as a basic design material that, incidentally, happens to have interactive behavior. © 2013 The Author.

AB  - We present two empirical studies of visual search in dynamic 3D visualisations of large, randomly ordered, photo collections. The aim is to assess the possible effects of geometrical distortions on visual search effectiveness, efficiency and comfort, by comparing the influence of two perspective representations of photo collections on participants' performance results and subjective judgments. Thumbnails of the 1000 or so photographs in each collection are plastered on the lateral surface of a vertical cylinder, either on the inside (inner view, IV) or on the outside (outer view, OV). IV and OV suggest two different interaction metaphors: locomotion in a virtual space (IV) versus manipulation of a virtual object (OV). They also implement different perspective distortions: enlargement and distortion of lateral columns (IV) versus enlargement of central columns and dwindling plus distortion of lateral columns (OV). Presentation of results focus on the second study, S2, which involved 20 participants and offered them strictly identical interaction facilities with the two views, unlike the initial pilot study, S1 (8 participants and slightly different interaction facilities between the two views). Participants in both studies were experienced computer users (average age: 25.15 years, SD: 3.13). They performed two types of basic visual tasks that are carried out repeatedly while navigating photo collections: (i) searching for a photo meeting specific, visual and thematic, criteria, the photo and its location in the collection being unknown to participants (ST1) and (ii) looking for a visually familiar photo, the location of the photo being familiar to participants (ST2). According to post-experiment questionnaires and debriefings, all participants in S2 save one judged both 3D views positively in reference to standard 2D visualisations. Half of them preferred IV over OV, four appreciated OV better, and six expressed no clear opinion. Preferences were mainly motivated by the effects of perspective distortions on thumbnail visibility. They were barely influenced by interaction metaphors (e.g., the feeling of immersion induced by IV). Despite large inter-individual differences in performance, a majority of participants carried out ST1 tasks more effectively and efficiently with IV than with OV, as regards error rates (statistically significant difference) and search times (tendency). Performance results for ST2 tasks were similar with the two views, due, probably, to the simplicity and brevity of ST2 tasks. Perspective distortions seem to have exerted less influence on participants' visual strategies than horizontal scrolling, a dynamic feature common to both views. Qualitative analyses of participants' behaviours suggest that IV has the potential to support spatial memory better than OV, presumably thanks to the locomotion metaphor. These results indicate that perspective views have the potential to facilitate and improve visual search in unstructured picture collections provided that distortions are adapted to users' individual visual capabilities. Further research is needed to better understand: (i) the actual relations between visual exploration strategies and geometrical properties of perspective visualisations and (ii) the influence of the manipulation and locomotion metaphors on spatial memory. This knowledge is necessary to further improve the comfort and effectiveness of visual search in large unstructured picture collections, using 3D visualisations. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Consumer-facing cybercrime is an increasing concern for individuals and societies. Nevertheless, current estimates of its costs are unreliable and there is no consensus on adequate measurement methods. This article presents a tailored survey instrument, which explicitly asks for monetary and non-monetary cybercrime losses and protection expenses. We collect representative data in a victimization survey of adult Internet users covering seven types of consumer-facing cybercrime in six selected EU member states. Victims are oversampled to increase the number of informative data points in the loss distributions. We use the loss data to evaluate different summary indicators regarding their robustness and precision in depicting the size of the cybercrime problem. We find that the distributions of victim losses and protection expenses are zero-inflated and skewed to the right. Aggregate victim losses are dwarfed by protection expenses at the societal level. A robust harmonized loss indicator allows for comparisons between crime types and across countries. Among the crime types studied, scams cause the severest impact on victims, as opposed to payment-related fraud. From the perspective of method development, our findings offer evidence-based insights to inform the instrument design and data analysis of future survey-based measurements of consumer-facing cybercrime.

AB  - Customization of Web-based applications is often considered a designer skill rather than an end-user need. However, there is an ongoing shift to end-user-centred technology, and even users with poor or no skill in Web-based languages may feel the need to customize Web applications according to their preferences. Although Web authoring environments have an increasing number of features, the challenge of providing end-users with the ability to easily customize entire Web applications still remains unsolved. In this paper, we propose an intelligent approach to customizing Web-based applications. Customizations rules are automatically inferred by the system from changes that users supply as examples. They remain as long-term knowledge that can be applied to support future interactions, thus minimizing the amount of authoring that end-users need to do for this purpose. In order to better understand the implications of the user's modifications, they are analysed using the logical descriptions of the corresponding Web pages. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We describe our use of contradictions, a concept central to a popular formulation of activity theory, to derive requirements of a new technical system to support an administrative system. Contradictions are the underlying causes of disturbances in the free operation of workplace activities. We argue and demonstrate that the resolution of such contradictions can be used as the basis for the (user-centred) design of a new system. We conclude that contradictions are both conceptually valuable in understanding the design of systems and are of considerable practical use. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The ICT infrastructure transformations for integrating cloud, software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) are emerging extensively to satisfy dynamic user requirements on diversified functionalities over large-scale resource pools. These infrastructure transformations are causing new sets of operational problems for operators, as a consequence of inadequate end-to-end visibility and visualization support about underlay infrastructure. Particularly, for multi-tenant/multisite underlay infrastructure, resource monitoring and associated flow identification are major challenges. To address these operational challenges, precise visibility monitoring and interactive visualizations are essential. Therefore, in this paper, by realizing an interactive visualization of multi-layer (i.e. resource-layer and flow-layer) visibility, we address the real-world operational issues of experimental SDN-enabled distributed clouds, denoted as OF@TEIN and OF@KOREN Playgrounds. By leveraging SmartX MultiView Visibility Framework, we first strive to enable visibility collection and validation. We then link it with subsequent visibility integration capability empowered by DataLake-based visibility storage. Additionally, by taking the example of OF@TEIN and OF@KOREN Playgrounds, we present verification results on prototype implementations. The results justify the proposed approach for timely unveiling critical operational issues by efficaciously leveraging the multi-layer visibility.

AB  - The creation of smart environments that are adaptive and responsive to the context in which they are being used has been one of the strongest ideas in ambient intelligence, but also one of the areas in which there seems to be a persistent gap between the initial promises and its real achievements. A possible reason why this is so challenging is that context-driven interaction and systems support are highly interdependent, but are rarely designed together. In this paper, we analyse the implications of context-driven interaction to the type of systems support provided by smart environments. The analysis is based on the study of previous work in this area and structured around three main dimensions of interaction with smart environments: physical integration; spontaneous interoperation and application programming abstractions. The contributions of this paper are 2-fold: a characterization of the system design space according to the requirements raised by context-driven interaction and the identification of new alternative paths for the integration of context-driven interaction into smart environments. © 2013 The Author.

AB  - In order to design a "haptic zoom", in this fundamental study, we compare two scaling methods by focusing on the strategies adopted by subjects who are using a sensory substitution device. Method 1 consists of a reduction of the sensor size and of its displacement speed. Speed reduction is obtained by a "human" movement adjustment (hand speed reduction). Method 2 consists of a straightforward increase in the dimensions of the image. The experimental device used couples a pen on a graphics tablet with tactile sensory stimulators. These are activated when the sensor impinges on the outline of the figure on the computer screen. This virtual sensor (a square matrix composed of 16 elementary fields) moves when the pen, guided by human hand movements, moves on the graphics tablet. The results show that the recognition rate is closely dependent on the size of the figure, and that the strategies used by the subjects are more suitable for method 2 than for method 1. In fact, half of the subjects found that method 1 inhibited their movements, and the majority of them did not feel the scaling effect, whereas this was clearly felt in method 2. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Speech interfaces are growing in popularity. Through a review of 99 research papers this work maps the trends, themes, findings and methods of empirical research on speech interfaces in the field of human-computer interaction (HCI). We find that studies are usability/theory-focused or explore wider system experiences, evaluating Wizard of Oz, prototypes or developed systems. Measuring task and interaction was common, as was using self-report questionnaires to measure concepts like usability and user attitudes. A thematic analysis of the research found that speech HCI work focuses on nine key topics: system speech production, design insight, modality comparison, experiences with interactive voice response systems, assistive technology and accessibility, user speech production, using speech technology for development, peoples' experiences with intelligent personal assistants and how user memory affects speech interface interaction. From these insights we identify gaps and challenges in speech research, notably taking into account technological advancements, the need to develop theories of speech interface interaction, grow critical mass in this domain, increase design work and expand research from single to multiple user interaction contexts so as to reflect current use contexts. We also highlight the need to improve measure reliability, validity and consistency, in the wild deployment and reduce barriers to building fully functional speech interfaces for research. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS: Most papers focused on usability/theory-based or wider system experience research with a focus on Wizard of Oz and developed systems Questionnaires on usability and user attitudes often used but few were reliable or validated Thematic analysis showed nine primary research topics Challenges identified in theoretical approaches and design guidelines, engaging with technological advances, multiple user and in the wild contexts, critical research mass and barriers to building speech interfaces

AB  - For over 40 years, system response time has been a topic of interest and controversy in computer science. Since the late 1960s, the field has seen numerous studies conducted and articles written addressing the issue. Many factors were measured in these studies including: users' accuracy and error rates with different levels of system response time, user performance speed and the efficiency of the commands used, how user interactions with the computer changed as a result of changes in system response time, how their bodies reacted physiologically to those same changes and even how happy, satisfied, anxious or annoyed they were as system response times changed. In this paper, we summarize the major issues in system response time research and look at what can be concluded from them. Generally, researchers have suggested specific response-time guidelines based on the complexity of the task or the type of interaction with the computer. We suggest that rather than system response time being task- or expectation-focused, instead interactions with a computer fall into two categories: control tasks and conversational tasks. For control tasks, immediate response times are necessary for optimal user performance whereas for conversational tasks, some delays may be necessary to maintain the optimal pacing of the on-going conversation. The location and duration of these delays will depend on both task complexity and user expectations. Future system response time research is needed to further quantify limits of delay detection, and the location and duration of inter-task delays to optimize user performance and satisfaction with computers. © 2011 British Informatics Society Limited.

AB  - Hundreds of technical, special interest Internet weblogs are already generating thousands of niche articles worldwide, and many institutions are starting to create internal blogs for team collaboration. As this style of communication becomes more pervasive in the lives of employees and researchers, the difficulty of finding relevant information only grows with the number of authors and articles. To reduce the load, we propose using implicit group messaging (IGM) to automatically deliver relevant content to readers grouped by shared characteristics or interests. In this paper, we outline a context-aware application suited to special interest messaging and describe three alternative delivery models including our peer-to-peer (P2P) design called SPICE and a broker-based design. We investigate the advantages and disadvantages of each approach through detailed simulations driven by realistic data and actual national/global network topologies. We find that although a broker-based design is generally the most network efficient and lowest latency, a structured P2P system can offer exceptionally low and fair loading across peers and network links without relying on specialized broker nodes.

AB  - Wizard of Oz(WOZ) is a well-established method for simulating the functionality and user experience of future systems. Using a human wizard to mimic certain operations of a potential system is particularly useful in situations where extensive engineering effort would otherwise be needed to explore the design possibilities offered by such operations. TheWOZ method has been widely used in connection with speech and language technologies, but advances in sensor technology and pattern recognition as well as new application areas such as human-robot interaction have made it increasingly relevant to the design of a wider range of interactive systems. In such cases, achieving acceptable performance at the user interface level often hinges on resource-intensive improvements such as domain tuning, which are better done once the overall design is relatively stable. AlthoughWOZ is recognized as a valuable prototyping technique, surprisingly little effort has been put into exploring it from a methodological point of view. Starting from a survey of the literature, this paper presents a systematic investigation and analysis of the design space forWOZ for language technology applications, and proposes a generic architecture for tool support that supports the integration of components for speech recognition and synthesis as well as for machine translation. This architecture is instantiated inWebWOZ-a new web-based open-sourceWOZ prototyping platform. The viability of generic support is explored empirically through a series of evaluations. Researchers from a variety of backgrounds were able to create experiments, independent of their previous experience withWOZ. The approach was further validated through a number of real experiments, which also helped to identify a number of possibilities for additional support, and flagged potential issues relating to consistency in wizard performance.

AB  - Home computer users are regularly advised to install software updates to stay secure. Windows 10 Home Edition automatically downloads and installs updates, restarting the computer if needed. Automatic restarts can be managed through a number of features, such as 'active hours' (within which a computer will not restart to complete an update) or by setting a time for restart. Applications active prior to a restart can register with the operating system, to automatically restart once updates have been installed. This research investigates if the features Microsoft provides for managing updates on Windows 10 Home Edition are appropriate for computer owners. We build a model of Windows 10 update behaviour, identifying interaction points between update features and users. We contrast theory with reality in a survey with 93 Windows 10 Home users, capturing experiences and perceptions. While overall perceptions of updates were positive, the pattern of use of most participants was incompatible with the default 'active hours' settings (28% of participants knew of its existence). Participants were mostly unaware of quality (bug fix) updates, mostly perceiving that updates add features. Half of our participants reported unexpected restarts, while half also reported growing concern about the state of their device if an update took a long time. Those with previous negative update experiences had weaker beliefs about their ability to control updates than those who had not. To make the updates less disruptive, applications can request to be restarted by Windows after a reboot. Of the 47 commonly used applications which were tested, only two supported seamless continuation after a restart. Unsaved data were lost in 21 applications, and 14 appeared to rely on internal autosave features to capture unsaved data, but did not completely restore User Interface arrangements. We recommend that operating systems obtain explicit permission for restarts, consistently; there are opportunities for features such as active hours and update progress displays to learn from usage activity. At the same time, applications should be more resilient to restarts to reduce the burden on users to recover their activities.

AB  - We perform a detailed survey and analysis of the most significant attacks, which have targeted industrial control systems over the past decade, based on detailed incident reports from scientific and non-traditional resources. This work is the first that considers together a comprehensive set of real-world cyber-attacks with the purpose of deriving a set of common features focusing particularly on the process control network. Each attack is decomposed to provide a comprehensive overview followed by a discussion of the commonalities identified across attacks. To achieve this, each attack is modelled using Attack Trees with Sequential AND, and mapped to the industrial control system Cyber Kill Chain. We focus on the methods of intrusion rather than the identification of actors. This article can be read in two parts: first, an analysis of each attack, and secondly a discussion of the derived commonalities. The resulting commonalities can be used to develop improved detection strategies to detect modern adversarial techniques and tactics.

AB  - Phishing has become a serious cyber-security issue, and it is spreading through various media such as e-mail, SMS to capture the victim's critical profile information. Although many novel anti-phishing techniques have been developed to forestall the progress of phishing, it remains an unresolved issue. Smishing is an incarnation of Phishing attack, which utilizes Short Messaging Service (SMS) or simple text message on mobile phones to lure the victim's online credentials. This paper presents an anti-phishing model entitled 'SmiDCA' (SMIshing Detection based on Correlation Algorithm). The proposed model has collected different smishing messages from various sources, and 39 distinct features were extracted initially. The SmiDCA model incorporates dimensionality reduction, and machine Learning-based experiments were conducted on without (BFSA) and with (AFSA) reduction of features. The model has been validated with experiments on both the English and non-English datasets and the results of both of these experiments are encouraging in terms of accuracy: 96.40% for English dataset and 90.33% for the non-English dataset. In addition, the model achieved an accuracy of 96.16% even after nearly half of the features were pruned.

AB  - Even in the current computer age, there are still many important application areas, such as early architectural design, where traditional tools like sketching on paper continue to be preferred by many professionals over computer-based tools. There is a growing awareness that there are often very good grounds for this preference. Hence, instead of trying to replace such traditional ways of working, it is now often considered more opportune to try and preserve the strengths of these traditional ways of working, while at the same time improving them by providing access to new media. This is one of the main objectives of the augmented reality approach that we adopt here. In this paper, we specifically discuss the realization of a tool for early architectural design on an existing augmented reality system, called the Visual Interaction Platform. We describe the development process, the resulting tool and its performance for elementary tasks such as positioning and overdrawing. We also identify directions for future research and applications. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Genetic Algorithms may be used together with Pareto Optimality in the process of selection of a suitable video content adaptation strategy, the former to return best or fittest solutions that have evolved over many generations and the latter to evaluate and rank each generation's solutions against a set of objectives without the need to assign weights to each one. The outcome of this is a Pareto front of optimal strategies, all of which would satisfy the objectives. The distribution of optimal strategies on a Pareto front, however, suggests that there may be a 'best-fit' optimal strategy. This article refines the process of selection of an optimal strategy by taking into account this distribution alongside user preferences, video content characteristics and usage history. In order to make the refined process dynamic, it pursues its implementation using Self-Organising Neural Networks. © The Author 2008.

AB  - The aim of this research was to explore the role of Schwartz's ten universal human values in the context of using products and services. Seventy-five participants were asked to qualitatively describe a product or service especially well in line with their values and a product or service in conflict with their values, and to evaluate them on a number of rating scales. The scales included 30 statements (three statements per universal value) probing the presence of each value in user experiences related to products and services and 10 statements studying the perceived importance of each value. The results showed that all the ten universal values were relevant in the evaluations of products and services both in line with the users' values and in conflict with the users' values. In the current sample, hedonism and self-direction were rated as the values most frequently present and most important in the evaluations of products and services in line with values. Power was rated as a moderately important value for products in conflict with values, but significantly less important for products in line with values. Achievement values were frequently reported in the qualitative descriptions, but they were less prominent in the quantitative data. The results suggest that the model of ten universal values is promising in understanding the role of users' value preferences in using products and services, and it seems to have potential for complementing the psychological needs approach in understanding user experience.

One key requirement was the ability to quantify the effectiveness of the audio map, so we describe the design and implementation of the evaluation, which took the form of a game downloaded by participants to their own computers. The results demonstrate that participants (blind, partially sighted and sighted) have acquired detailed spatial knowledge and also that the availability of positional audio cues significantly improves wayfinding performance. © The Author 2013.

AB  - Jointly working on shared digital artifacts - such as wikis - is a well-tried method of developing knowledge collectively within a group or organization. Our assumption is that such knowledge maturing is an accommodation process that can be measured by taking the writing process itself into account. This paper describes the development of a tool that detects accommodation automatically with the help of machine learning algorithms. We applied a software framework for task detection to the automatic identification of accommodation processes within a wiki. To set up the learning algorithms and test its performance, we conducted an empirical study, in which participants had to contribute to a wiki and, at the same time, identify their own tasks. Two domain experts evaluated the participants' micro-tasks with regard to accommodation. We then applied an ontology-based task detection approach that identified accommodation with a rate of 79.12%. The potential use of our tool for measuring knowledge maturing online is discussed. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Personal Information Management (PIM) refers to the practice and the study of how people acquire, organize, maintain, retrieve, archive and discard information for various reasons in physical and digital worlds. Many PIM tools are available for managing information on our desktop computers while many research prototypes have tried to augment or replace them. The development of these tools was based on knowledge drawn from the fields of psychology, human-computer interaction, information retrieval, knowledge management and research in the PIM field. Different metaphors and ways of organizing were introduced. However, the prevailing beliefs are that most of these prototypes were not extensively tested and that the radical design (not addressing real-world issues) and quick abandonment of prototypes prevented transfer to mainstream products. This paper looks at what has been developed and learnt, what has been transferred to mainstream applications, discusses the possible reasons behind these trends and challenges some parts of the above-mentioned beliefs.

AB  - This article evaluates the usability of motion sensing-based interaction on a mobile platform using image browsing as a representative task. Three types of interfaces, a physical button interface, a motion-sensing interface using a high-precision commercial 3D motion tracker, and a motion-sensing interface using an in-house low-cost 3D motion tracker, are compared in terms of task performance and subjective preference. Participants were provided with prolonged training over 20 days, in order to compensate for the participants' unfamiliarity with the motion-sensing interfaces. Experimental results showed that the participants' task performance and subjective preference for the two motion-sensing interfaces were initially low, but they rapidly improved with training and soon approached the level of the button interface. Furthermore, a recall test, which was conducted 4 weeks later, demonstrated that the usability gains were well retained in spite of the long time gap between uses. Overall, these findings highlight the potential of motion-based interaction as an intuitive interface for mobile devices. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Users have long been recognized as the weakest link in security. Accordingly, researchers have applied knowledge from the fields of psychology and human-computer interaction to understand the security behaviors of users. However, many cognitive processes and responses are unconscious or obligatory and yet still have a profound effect on users' security behaviors. With this in mind, researchers have begun to apply methods and theories of neuroscience to yield greater insights into the "black box" of user cognition. The goal of this approach-termed neurosecurity-is to better understand and improve users' behaviors. This study illustrates the potential for neurosecurity by investigating how two fundamental biological factors-gender and color perception-affect users' reception of security warnings. This is important to determine because research has shown that users frequently fail to appropriately respond to security warnings. We conducted a laboratory experiment using electroencephalography, a proven method of measuring neurological activity in temporally sensitive tasks. We found that the amplitude of the P300-an event-related potential component indicative of decision-making ability-was higher for all participants when viewing malware warning screenshots relative to legitimate website shots. Additionally, we found that the P300 was greater for women than for men, indicating that women exhibit higher brain activity than men when viewing malware warnings. However, we found that there was no change in the P300 when viewing red warnings compared to grayscale warnings. Together, our results demonstrate the value of applying neurosecurity methods to the domain of cybersecurity and point to several promising avenues for future research.

AB  - This paper explores computer failure as a social event by examining recorded interactions between computer users and help-desk consultants (technicians). It was found, first, that the nature of a failure was negotiated between participants rather than being simply technically evident. Failure was defined from users' perspectives, in relation to what they were trying to achieve, rather than according to technical parameters. Secondly, negotiations of failure had social consequences for both users and help-desk consultants. Both avoided being seen as incompetent and actively defended their social standing. Thirdly, such social issues sometimes took precedence over technical and practical ones. The implications for HCI theorists and practitioners are twofold: firstly, failure should be accepted as a regular part of computer use in which human-computer interaction continues even though the interface may be non-functional. Secondly, the management of failure could be better addressed if technicians were trained in social as well as technical intervention skills. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The exponential growth of IoT devices and their need to use IPv6 addresses has the potential to create load stress on the existing DNS infrastructure and it is imperative that DNS servers to be deployed on IPv6 networks. The DNS query latency from a particular Internet vantage point for IPv4 and IPv6 network cannot be compared directly due to variations in the number of hops of query on IPv4 and IPv6 communication networks. Moreover, there is no assurance that DNS server in the hierarchy is hosted on a dual-stack. This work brings out the DNS query resolution latency over the IPv4 and IPv6 protocol stacks with better accuracy. The experiments are carried out by setting up a complete DNS hierarchy (ROOT, TLD, STLD, TTLD and recursive resolver) on dual IP stack (IPv4 and IPv6), enabling both forward and reverse lookup tree on a live testbed, ensuring a constant number of hops between the recursive resolver and each of the DNS servers in the hierarchy. This live testbed is a first of its kind and is made available for Internet researchers. The operational issues encountered during this deployment and service provisioning are discussed and documented in this paper. This paper also gives a clear illustration and provides reference guidelines for the DNS hierarchy setup, and also aims to bridge the knowledge gap required for deploying DNS over IPv6.

AB  - By coupling parametric modeling, building performance simulation engines, and optimization algorithms, optimal design choices regarding predefined building performance objectives can be automatically obtained. This becomes an emerging research topic among scholars in the fields of architecture and built environment. However, it is not easy to apply this method to real building design projects, because of two main drawbacks: Building performance simulation is too time consuming, and the numerical visualization of final results is not intuitive for architects to make decisions. Therefore, this study tries to fill these two gaps by training an artificial neural network to replace simulation engines and developing a web application to speed up the 3D visualization of selected design choices. These two strategies are applied to optimize office towers' window wall ratios in Hangzhou, China. Architects working on new design projects in that city can obtain the optimal group of window wall ratios for four facades in 2 s, faster than using simulation engines, which cost architects 2 weeks. Moreover, architects can also efficiently observe the appearance of design solutions with the web application. By improving its usability from these two aspects, this study significantly improves the applicability of algorithmic optimization for building design projects.

AB  - With the increasing rate and catastrophic consequences of phishing attacks, research on antiphishing solutions has gained growing importance in information security. Security risks may include information leakage, identity theft, financial loss and reputation sabotage. Raising human awareness is not a sufficient mitigation method and deploying complementary technical solutions is a crucial requirement. Although various approaches have been proposed in the literature, the design of efficient phishing detection models is a challenging task and the problem still lacks a complete solution. In this paper, we present a novel approach for detecting phishing websites based on probabilistic neural networks (PNNs). We also investigate the integration of PNN with K-medoids clustering to significantly reduce complexity without jeopardizing the detection accuracy. To assess the feasibility of the proposed approach, we conducted in-depth study to evaluate various performance measures on a publicly available data set composed of 11 055 phishing and benign websites. The experimental results show that more accurate models can be built and even with > 40% reduction in the complexity, > 97% accuracy can be achieved with low false errors.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to make a case generally for an ontology for accessibility requirements specification. Requirements specification is generally intended to provide clear, testable descriptions of what a system should do. What an ontology would do is to act like a requirements bank that provides methodology independent accessibility requirements that could then be used to extrapolate, on demand, conceptual models for a variety of implementations driven by a variety of methodologies. The effect of this would be to minimise requirements specification, ensure declarativity, standardisation, interoperability and reusability, whilst at the same time lending greater migratability from specification to design. There has been much worldwide action in developing guidelines, tools and methods in an attempt to ensure that technologies and information systems are accessible. There is, however, a growing need to partner these initiatives more closely with software engineering traditions. An ontology for accessibility requirements would provide formal semantic specifications beyond the syntactic provisions rendered by commonly used formal specification languages. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The two main tasks of a smart TV GUI are menu navigation and free pointing. Traditional remotes with directional keys are suitable for menu navigation but may not be so for free pointing. More recent remotes with a two-dimensional (2D) pointing device are suitable for free pointing but may not be so for menu navigation. To support both types of tasks well, we devised a new input device called TouchRoller. We expect that it can support both types of tasks well because it has a separable control structure and a continuous input property. A comparative user study showed that the performance of TouchRoller is comparable to that of directional keys for menu navigation and 2D pointing devices for free pointing. In addition, it was most favored by the participants, and NASA TLX test results showed that TouchRoller demands the lowest task load.

This article focuses on computer mouse as a common tool for browsing the web and its characteristics of use. The article provides a comprehensive study of related research papers and compares approaches to the preprocessing stage of biometric authentication which is a potential target for improvement. The article further proposes a framework to assess the quality of features with respect to the theory of biometrics. Using this framework, a comprehensive set of features across the works is compared on datasets acquired from two controlled experiments simulating both static and continuous authentication. The article shows that selection of features based on the proposed assessment has a positive impact on user authentication results.

Little has been reported on how the experience of using this kind of interactive site differs from the 'point and click' interactivity of the early Web. This paper reports on a qualitative study of users who entered text while visiting a website of their choice. It shows how the process brought with it two levels of awareness: that of the interface, and that of the social context beyond the interface. The paper goes on to describe the perception of audience that emerged from analysing users' accounts. It also gives details of the data collection method, which is based on the work of Vermersch and has not been widely used outside France for analysing interaction with computers.

AB  - We believe that, to manage Web data effectively, there is a need to build a data warehouse of Web data, i.e. a Web warehouse. In this paper, we focus on how to represent and store relevant hyperlinked Web documents effectively in a Web warehouse called WHOWEDA (WareHouse Of WEb DAta) for further querying and manipulation. We present a simple and general model for representing metadata, structure and content of Web documents and hyperlinks in WHOWEDA. We discuss node and link objects which are used to represent Web documents and hyperlinks respectively in WHOWEDA. These objects are first class objects in our data model called WHOM (WareHouse Object Model) which is designed to represent and manipulate Web data in the warehouse. An important feature of our model is that it represents metadata, content and structure as trees called node and link metadata trees, and node and link data trees.

AB  - Web pages typically include many visual elements such as header and footer to support interaction with the user. However, if web pages do not comply with web accessibility guidelines, and these visual elements are not explicitly encoded in the underlying source code, they become inaccessible in alternative presentations, such as audio. This article presents an automatic role detection approach to identify visual elements in web pages and their roles. The system architecture has three major components: automatic identification of visual elements in web pages; automatic generation of heuristic rules from the knowledge base; and application of these rules for automatic annotation of visual elements with their roles. This article first explains the system architecture in detail and then presents both technical and user evaluations of the proposed approach. Our user evaluation shows that the automatic role detection approach has around 70% receptive accuracy, but the proposed knowledge base could be further improved for better results. Our technical evaluation shows that the complexity is an important performance factor in role detection - required resources and execution time increases when the web page has more complex structure.

AB  - Efficient fault detection and characterization are crucial requirements for automated network diagnosis systems. In this paper, we present normalized statistical signatures (NSSs), a network 'soft-failure' characterization technique for user devices (UDs) based upon exhaustive sets of aggregated statistical features extracted from transmission control protocol (TCP) packet streams. TCP streams are collected on-demand (e.g. upon user complaint) with fixed data transfer limits to capture the artifacts resulting from UD faults. NSSs created using live network and testbed data are able to uniquely characterize many faults and offer insight into how various types of features are affected by the faults and networks. We then introduce the link adaptive signature estimation (LASE) technique to reduce the quantities of collected NSSs required for generalized diagnostic systems with variable link parameters. We create feature estimator functions using multivariate regression techniques to generate artificial NSSs, which are subsequently used to train machine learning systems that have robust generalization capabilities. Performance of a prototype fault classifier system based on NSSs shows that an overall detection accuracy of 98% can be achieved for eight types of faults in a live network environment. In this paper, we specifically focus on formulating the basic framework of NSS and LASE, and limit the analysis to wired networks. This work can later be extended to encompass more complex fixed and mobile wireless networking environments. We expect that the combination of NSSs and LASE can serve as the foundation of next-generation automated network diagnosis systems. © 2013 The British Computer Society 2013.

AB  - Recent applications on mobile devices have increased the dependence of the user on visual feedback for effective interaction with the interface. When loading an application, a user may encounter a long wait time which is generally inevitable and is viewed as the primary negative emotion sources from the user interface. This study conducted a 2 × 3 mixed factorial design to explore whether different feedback types of wait indicators (i.e. bar and cartoon-bar designs) and feedback velocities (i.e. constant, accelerate, and decelerate progress speeds) may affect user's time perception and wait evaluations. Twenty-four young adults participated in this study. The experimental data were collected through a time estimation and a 7-point Likert scale. The generated results revealed that: (i) Participants' time estimation could be shortened when they encountered the 'decelerate' progress speed. (ii) Participants' time estimation and perceived speed might not always be consistent. (iii) The feedback type of 'cartoon-bar' might not significantly reduce participants' time perception. Nonetheless, the 'cartoon-bar' type significantly improve participants' wait evaluations. (iv) The feedback progress speeds positively correlated with wait evaluations by participants. RESEARCH Highlights: The visual feedback designs affect the user's time estimation and wait evaluations. The progress bar with lovely elements can improve user's wait experiences. The progress speed of 'decelerate' can reduce the user's time estimation. User's time estimation and perceived speed might not always be consistent. User's perceived speed positively correlated with their wait evaluations.

AB  - User-centered design (UCD) practitioners in industrial context are often faced with multilevel factors that hinder their effort to involve users in the context of use, and so meet one of the core UCD principles. Seen the heterogeneous and dynamic context of mobile system use, applying this principle becomes more challenging. Based on in-depth interviews with various mobile practitioners in Finland and the Netherlands, we explore the core factors that affect UCD practitioners in meeting this challenge. Our findings confirm the impact of the professional-client relationship as a key factor that inhibits the involvement of users. Novelty aspects, e.g. practitioners' unfamiliarity with the users and the perceived innovativeness of the designed system, largely explain the involvement of users in situ. Interestingly, these conditions are not idiosyncratic to mobile computing. We discuss the contextual factors' implications on UCD and emphasize alternative strategies that support practitioners in their effort to involve users.

AB  - Nowadays, the idea of media contents streaming through the Internet has become a very important issue. On the other hand, full caching for media objects is not a practical solution and leads to consume the cache storage in keeping few media objects because of its limited capacity. Furthermore, repeated traffic which is being sent to clients wastes the network bandwidth. Thus, utilizing the bandwidth of the network is considered as an important objective for network administrators. Media objects have some characteristics that have to be considered when a caching algorithm is going to be performed. In this paper, recent approaches that have been proposed for media streams caching in peer-to-peer systems are reviewed. © 2013 The British Computer Society 2013. All rights reserved.

AB  - Online and offline storage of digital currency present conflicting risks for a Bitcoin exchange. While bitcoins stored on online devices are continually vulnerable to malware and other network-based attacks, offline reserves are endangered on access, as transferring bitcoins requires the exposure of otherwise encrypted and secured private keys. In particular, fluctuations in customer demand for deposited bitcoin require exchanges to periodically refill online storage systems with bitcoins held offline. This raises the natural question of what upper limit on online reserves minimizes losses due to theft over time. In this article, we investigate this optimization problem, developing a model that predicts the optimal ceiling on online reserves, given average rates of deposits, withdrawals, and theft. We evaluate our theory with an event-driven simulation of the setup, and find that our equation yields a numerical value for the threshold that differs by less than 2% from experimental results. We conclude by considering open questions regarding more complex storage architectures.

AB  - This paper presents two studies of the use of the WWW in Scottish universities and American land-grant universities. First, we investigated the relationship between the organisational profile of a university department in Scotland and its structural connectivity on the WWW. A Spearman rank order correlation analysis revealed a number of strong correlation relationships between structural connectivity measures and the organisational profile based on research assessment exercise ratings, teaching quality assessments, student-staff ratios and funding levels. Linkage patterns from 13 Scottish academic sites to commercial sites in Britain and America highlighted the impact of culture and the appropriateness of information technologies on the acceptance of the WWW. The second study is a content survey of WWW-based education activities in American land-grant universities to investigate successful applications of these enabling techniques in education. The two studies together highlighted cultural, political and technological interactions in the use of the WWW. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The study presented in this article investigated to what extent bank customers understand the terms and conditions (T&Cs) they have signed up to. If many customers are not able to understand T&Cs and the behaviours they are expected to comply with, they risk not being compensated when their accounts are breached. An expert analysis of 30 bank contracts across 25 countries found that most contract terms were too vague for customers to infer required behaviour. In some cases the rules vary for different products, meaning the advice can be contradictory at worst. While many banks allow customers to write Personal identification numbers (PINs) down (as long as they are disguised and not kept with the card), 20% of banks categorically forbid writing PINs down, and a handful stipulate that the customer have a unique PIN for each account. We tested our findings in a survey with 151 participants in Germany, the USA and UK. They mostly agree: only 35% fully understand the T&Cs, and 28% find important sections are unclear. There are strong regional variations: Germans found their T&Cs particularly hard to understand, and USA bank customers assumed some of their behaviours contravened the T&Cs, but were reassured when they actually read them.

AB  - This paper describes a novel instantiation of a digital photo library in a public access system. It demonstrates how designers can utilize characteristics of a target user community (social constraints, trust, and a lack of anonymity) to provide capabilities, such as unrestricted annotation and uploading of photos, which would be impractical in other types of public access systems. It also presents a compact set of design principles and guidelines for ensuring the immediate usability of public access information systems. These principles and guidelines were derived from our experience developing PhotoFinder Kiosk, a community photo library. Attendees of a major HCI conference (CHI 2001 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems) successfully used the tool to browse and annotate collections of photographs spanning 20 years of HCI-related conferences, producing a richly annotated photo history of the field of human-computer interaction. Observations and usage log data were used to evaluate the tool and develop the guidelines. They provide specific guidance for practitioners, as well as a useful framework for additional research in public access interfaces. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Computer users have access to computer security information from many different sources, but few people receive explicit computer security training. Despite this lack of formal education, users regularly make many important security decisions, such as "Should I click on this potentially shady link?" or "Should I enter my password into this form?" For these decisions, much knowledge comes from incidental and informal learning. To better understand differences in the securityrelated information available to users for such learning, we compared three informal sources of computer security information: news articles, web pages containing computer security advice, and stories about the experiences of friends and family. Using a Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model, we found that security information from peers usually focuses on who conducts attacks, information containing expertise focuses instead on how attacks are conducted, and information from the news focuses on the consequences of attacks. These differences may prevent users from understanding the persistence and frequency of seemingly mundane threats (viruses, phishing), or from associating protective measures with the generalized threats the users are concerned about (hackers). Our findings highlight the potential for sources of informal security education to create patterns in user knowledge that affect their ability to make good security decisions.

AB  - Based on a 3-year ethnographical study, this paper discusses the prolonged use of computer-mediated communication (CMC) tools by approximately 400 older people in an adult education centre in Barcelona (Spain). Contrary to oversimplified views of older people as ICT users, this paper shows that they make a very rich use of CMC tools. Relevant elements of this use are their permanent desire to feel and be included, social, independent and competent ICT users. Despite the numerous interaction issues they face when using ICT, some are constant across different tools. Difficulties due to cognition limit their interactions more severely than those problems due to perceiving visual information or using the mouse. By examining the longitudinal aspect of the study, this paper addresses the evolution of technology use and whether the interaction issues that most of the current older people exhibit will be relevant when today's more ICT literate young adults grow older. Interaction issues due to cognition are time-persistent, and independent of both experience and practice with ICT. Difficulties reading from the screen or using input devices are overcome with ICT experience. The strategies adopted by older people for coping with all these interaction issues are always targeted at feeling and being included, social, independent and competent ICT users. The results deepen current understanding of tools use in connecting older people with their social circles and the interaction issues most of them encounter when using ICT. The results also suggest that cognitive-related problems will be the most important ones in our work with the next generation of older people. © 2011 British Informatics Society Limited.

AB  - When navigating large information spaces on mobile devices, the small size of the display often causes relevant content to shift off-screen, greatly increasing the difficulty of spatial tasks such as planning routes or finding points of interest on a map. Two possible approaches to mitigate the problem are Contextual Cues, i.e. visualizing abstract shapes in the border region of the view area to function as visual references to off-screen objects of interest, and Overview + Detail, i.e., simultaneously displaying a detail view and a small-scale overview of the information space. In this paper, we compare the effectiveness of two different Contextual Cues techniques, Wedge (Gustafson et al., 2008) and Scaled Arrows (Burigat et al., 2006), and a classical Overview + Detail visualization that highlights the location of objects of interest in the overview. The study involved different spatial tasks and investigated the scalability of the considered visualizations, testing them with two different numbers of off-screen objects. Results were multifaceted. With simple spatial tasks, no differences emerged among the visualizations. With more complex spatial tasks, Wedge had advantages when the task required to order off-screen objects with respect to their distance from the display window, while Overview + Detail was the best solution when users needed to find those off-screen objects that were closest to each other. Finally, we found that even a small increase in the number of off-screen objects negatively affected user performance in terms of accuracy, especially in the case of Scaled Arrows, while it had a negligible effect in terms of task completion times. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Haptic technologies are often used to improve access to the structural content of graphical user interfaces, thereby augmenting the interaction process for blind users. While haptic design guidelines offer valuable assistance when developing non-visual interfaces, the recommendations presented are often tailored to the feedback produced via one particular haptic input/output device. A blind user is therefore restricted to interacting with a device which may be unfamiliar to him/her, rather than selecting from the range of commercially available products. This paper reviews devices available on the first and second-hand markets, and describes an exploratory study undertaken with 12 blindfolded sighted participants to determine the effectiveness of three devices for non-visual web interaction. The force-feedback devices chosen for the study, ranged in the number of translations and rotations that the user was able to perform when interacting with them. Results have indicated that the Novint Falcon could be used to target items faster in the first task presented, compared with the other devices. However, participants agreed that the force-feedback mouse was most comfortable to use when interacting with the interface. Findings have highlighted the benefits which low cost haptic input/output devices can offer to the non-visual browsing process, and any changes which may need to be made to accommodate their deficiencies. The study has also highlighted the need for web designers to integrate appropriate haptic feedback on their web sites to cater for the strengths and weaknesses of various devices, in order to provide universally accessible sites and online applications. © 2011 British Informatics Society Limited.

AB  - In this article, the effect of a local, content (as opposed to structure) oriented navigation tool is investigated, i.e. mouse-over hyperlink previews. A usability experiment is described in which three groups of participants were exposed to three different versions of a website: without hyperlink previews, with content oriented, semantic previews, and with task-oriented, pragmatic previews. Participants were asked to execute search and recall tasks, and to evaluate task and hypertext. The results showed a decisive overall advantage for previews in terms of efficiency, but no effects on effectiveness or appreciation. Although semantic and pragmatic previews did not differ significantly, a post hoc analysis showed a learning effect of pragmatic previews that was absent in the semantic preview condition. It was concluded that previews fit in with the step-by-step goal orientation of hypertext users. Once users are acquainted with them, pragmatic previews speed up decision making. Apart from the experimental part, the article surveys research into the usability of navigation tools, thereby focusing on the analysis of navigation tools. The bottom line of this review is that most navigation tools as they are used in the experiments provide users with different types of information, e.g. local vs. global, content vs. structure oriented. This complicates the unequivocal explanation of their effect and may explain, together with user and task differences, the variety and inconsistencies observed in the results. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Adopting a re-materialization approach, we designed and implemented an everyday interactive artifact that enables an individual to monitor and establish the reconfirmation time of email data. This device represents a new means of handling and interacting with email. To investigate the value of the materialization of email data through a daily interactive object, Maili, we conducted a 1-month field study with five participants in their work environments. The results showed that applying physicality to email handling helped to increase accessibility to and interest in the data, as well as in the reconfirmation function of email. Results also indicated the value of combining non-digital (the tray) with digital functions. By presenting the process of using the dematerialized data, our findings offer new insights into how we can materialize digital information in everyday tangible artifacts.

Six frequent locations (right, left, above and below the erroneous input field, as well as on the top and at the bottom of the form) were tested in an online study with n = 303 participants. Results of efficiency, effectiveness and satisfaction show that the locations near the erroneous input field lead to a significantly better performance than the error messages on the top and at the bottom of the form; in addition error messages on the right side of the erroneous input field were subjectively evaluated as the most satisfying and intuitive by participants.

AB  - It is becoming increasingly easy for researchers to develop context-aware applications for smartphones. A perennial challenge, however, is to convince a large number of people to install them and donate contextual data for scientific purposes. Our empirical study seeks to address this challenge by investigating how people's perception and attitude affect their willingness to donate context data to researchers and quantifies the effects of social signals on donation action-taking. Our findings indicate that the perceived need for donation and perceived organization reputation are key determinants in deciding whether to donate: people with altruistic personality do not necessarily donate if they cannot see the need to take an action. Furthermore, we provide evidence that even if people indicate a willingness to donate, they are hesitant to take action towards donating data unless catalysts like social signals (hints about the actions of others) are present.

AB  - 3D virtual worlds are becoming increasingly popular as tool for social interaction, with the potential of augmenting the user's perception of physical and social presence. Thus, this technology could be of great benefit to older people, providing home-bound older users with access to social, educational and recreational resources. However, so far there have been few studies looking into how older people engage with virtual worlds, as most research in this area focuses on younger users. In this study, an online experiment was conducted with 30 older and 30 younger users to investigate age differences in the perception of presence in the use of virtual worlds for social interaction. Overall, we found that factors such as navigation and prior experience with text messaging tools played a key role in older people's perception of presence. Both physical and social presence was found to be linked to the quality of social interaction for users of both age groups. In addition, older people displayed proxemic behavior which was more similar to proxemic behavior in the physical world when compared to younger users. © 2012 British Informatics Society Limited.

AB  - Knowing users' expectations about what they expect on a website and where they expect to find it is crucial for the success of a website. For the last decade, technological advances have entailed major changes in website design but the impact of these changes on users' mental representations of websites remains unclear. In an online study (N = 841), we asked users to sketch their prototypical version of an online shop, a news website and a company page, thereby indicating the interface elements they expect on the website and their expected location. We compared our results to those of a previous study to investigate changes in users' mental representations of websites over time. This comparison suggests that interface elements such as the logo, main content and navigation area are still expected in the same location although others have shifted to the rich footer area at the bottom of the website. In addition, new elements such as links to social networks have been incorporated into users' mental representations whereas other interface elements have disappeared. By providing updated consolidated blueprint models for all three website types, we help designers to create expectation-based websites. Further implications for research and practitioners are discussed.

AB  - Given the increasingly important role the World Wide Web plays as an information source, and yet with the continuing problems that certain individuals, particularly those with disabilities and those using 'non-standard' Web browsing technology, it is vital that web resource providers be aware of design features which introduce barriers affecting the accessibility of on-line information. The role of the accessibility audit is seen as an important one in uncovering, describing, and explaining potential accessibility barriers present in a web site. It furthermore acts as an educational tool by raising awareness in accessible design amongst web designers and content providers in providing them with a recovery plan for improving the accessiblility of the audited resource, and potentially other resources. In 1999, the authors were commissioned to carry out accessibility audits of 11 web sites in the UK Higher Education sector. This paper discusses the development of the methodology used to carry out the audits, the findings of the audits in terms of accessibility levels of the subject sites, and feedback as a result of the auditing process. It concludes by looking at ways in which the methodology adopted may be tailored to suit specific types of web resource evaluation. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Governments around the globe are striving to provide e-government, online products and services to all the citizens of their respective countries. This has meant that there is a shift in the conventional mode of public service delivery from a face-to-face and telephone mode to electronic means. However, not all the citizens are making use of these changes, and the one demographic group that is currently attracting immense interest related to their welfare, health and other such issues is the older age group. Using this as a reason, the aim of this exploratory and explanatory research was to understand the e-government initiatives in the UK, more specifically in London. To conduct this research, a mixed qualitative and quantitative research approach was pursued. It was concluded that the benefits of the Internet to many of the users is relative, depending on the age, perceptions and level of innovativeness of the user. It was learnt that in relation to quality, the local authority websites do contain useful and relevant information for the elderly. However, this information is difficult to access, mainly due to the lack of knowledge, skills in the use of computers or Internet. From this research, it is expected that a contribution to academia will emerge in the form of a better understanding of issues related to e-government, the digital divide and older citizens. For industry, the contributions of this research are the identification and understanding of issues related to online products and services and the older citizen. For policy-makers, this research proffers an understanding of issues related with demand and supply of online products and services that governments are currently providing. © The Author 2013.

AB  - Personal computing has become all about mobile and embedded devices. As a result, the adoption rate of smartphones is rapidly increasing and this trend has set a need for mobile applications to be available at anytime, anywhere and on any device. Despite the obvious advantages of such immersive mobile applications, software developers are increasingly facing the challenges related to device fragmentation. Current application development solutions are insufficiently prepared for handling the enormous variety of software platforms and hardware characteristics covering the mobile eco-system. As a result, maintaining a viable balance between development costs and market coverage has turned out to be a challenging issue when developing mobile applications. This article proposes a context-aware software platform for the development and delivery of self-adaptive mobile applications over the Web. An adaptive application composition approach is introduced, capable of autonomously bypassing context-related fragmentation issues. This goal is achieved by incorporating and validating the concept of fine-grained progressive application enhancements based on a multicriteria decision-making strategy.

AB  - Within internet of things (IoT) research, there is a growing interest in leveraging the decentralization properties of blockchains, towards developing IoT authentication and authorization mechanisms that do not inherently require centralized third-party intermediaries. This paper presents a framework for sharing IoT data in a decentralized and private-by-design manner in exchange for monetary services. The framework is built on a tiered blockchain architecture, along with InterPlanetary File System for IoT data storage and transfer. The goal is to enable IoT data users to exercise fine-grained control on how much data they share with entities authenticated through blockchains. To highlight how the framework would be used in real-life scenarios, this paper presents two use cases, namely an IoT data marketplace and a decentralized connected vehicle insurance. These examples showcase how the proposed framework can be used for varying smart contract-based applications involving exchanges of IoT data and cryptocurrency. Following the discussion about the use cases, the paper outlines a detailed security analysis performed on the proposed framework, based on multiple attack scenarios. Finally, it presents and discusses extensive evaluations, in terms of various performance metrics obtained from a real-world implementation.

AB  - Social media have been used by some companies to support customer co-creation in recent years. However, few academic studies have been done to investigate the use of social media in customer co-creation. To understand the current state-of-the-art and future trends about the use of social media in customer co-creation, we conducted two studies to analyze relevant posts on blogs and social media-based online forums. This study reveals some interesting patterns, themes and future trends in this specific area. Recommendations are given to help managers engage in co-creation activities with customers.

AB  - In interface development, it is crucial to reflect the users' expectations and mental models. By meeting users' expectations, errors can be prevented and the efficiency of the interaction can be enhanced. Applying these guidelines to website development reveals the need to know where users expect to find the most common web objects like the search field, home button or the navigation. In a preliminary online study with 136 participants, the most common web objects were identified for three web page types: online shops, news portals, and company web pages. These objects were used for the main study, which was conducted with 516 participants. In an online application, prototypical websites had to be constructed by the participants. Data analysis showed that Internet users have distinct mental models for different web page types (online shop, news portal, and company web page). Users generally agree about the locations of many, but not all, web objects. These mental models are robust to demographic factors like gender and web expertise. This knowledge could be used to improve the perception and usability of websites. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Each day more and more Internet of Things (IoT) devices are being connected to the Internet. In general, their applications are diverse but from the security perspective, it is evident that they are increasingly targeted by cybercriminals and used for nefarious purposes. Network covert channels form a subgroup of the information-hiding research area where secrets are sent over communication networks embedded within the network traffic. Such techniques can be used, among others, by malware developers to enable confidential data exfiltration or stealth communications. Recently, distributed network covert channels have raised the attention of security professionals as they allow the cloaking of secret transmission by spreading the covert bits among many different types of data-hiding techniques. However, although there are many works dealing with IoT security, little effort so far has been devoted in determining how effective the covert channels threat can be in the IoT henvironments. That is why, in this article, we present an extensive analysis on how distributed network covert channels that utilize network traffic from IoT devices can be used to perform efficient secret communication. More importantly, we do not focus on developing novel data-hiding techniques but, instead, considering the nature of IoT traffic, we investigate how to combine existing covert channels so the resulting data transfer is less visible. Moreover, as another contribution of our work, we prepare and share with the community the network traffic dataset that can be used to develop effective countermeasures against such threats.

AB  - Over the last few years, we have witnessed a generalization of the consumption of video contents through different media (computers, television, mobile phones, tablets,...) that converge into a unified user experience in an (almost) all-IP technological environment. At the same time, there have been significant advances in the generation and characterization of multimedia contents, due to the advent of social networking and the consolidation of standards like moving picture experts group (MPEG)-4 and MPEG-7. Finally, it is becoming easier and more natural to interact with multimedia contents, thanks to devices like tactile screens and touchpads. Overall, this landscape enables great possibilities for advertising and e-commerce, far beyond the traditional business models of broadcast TV. In this paper, we present a novel realization of two non-invasive advertising and e-commerce models to exploit those possibilities, grounded on a cloud-based personalization engine. This system cannot only identify the most interesting products to advertise to each user at any time, but also compose personalized applications on the fly, ready to run on different consumer device platforms. Our experiments show that this proposal can be very positively perceived by the end users. © 2012 The Author.

AB  - The economic rationale for how much market power is tolerable has so far been based mainly on static considerations; ideally, however, it should discriminate between persistent and transitory market power. I propose a dynamic dominant-firm type of model where the firm's use of market power, when it is discovered by an antitrust agency, will be penalized. Equilibrium entails a threshold market share above which the market tends toward monopoly and below which the market tends to competition. One may propose the region below this threshold to be the safety zone. The size of this region depends on how fast market power depreciates. In industries in which this depreciation is fast and where, as a result, monopoly power is more transitory, the safety zone should be wider, and there should be less policy intervention. © The Author (2009).

AB  - Introduction: Glycerin (VG) and propylene glycol (PG) are the most common nicotine solvents used in e-cigarettes (ECs). It has been shown that at high temperatures both VG and PG undergo decomposition to low molecular carbonyl compounds, including the carcinogens formaldehyde and acetaldehyde. The aim of this study was to evaluate how various product characteristics, including nicotine solvent and battery output voltage, affect the levels of carbonyls in EC vapor. Methods: Twelve carbonyl compounds were measured in vapors from 10 commercially available nicotine solutions and from 3 control solutions composed of pure glycerin, pure propylene glycol, or a mixture of both solvents (50:50). EC battery output voltage was gradually modified from 3.2 to 4.8 V. Carbonyl compounds were determined using the HPLC/DAD method. Results: Formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were found in 8 of 13 samples. The amounts of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde in vapors from lower voltage EC were on average 13- and 807-fold lower than in tobacco smoke, respectively. The highest levels of carbonyls were observed in vapors generated from PG-based solutions. Increasing voltage from 3.2 to 4.8 V resulted in a 4 to more than 200 times increase in formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acetone levels. The levels of formaldehyde in vapors from high-voltage device were in the range of levels reported in tobacco smoke. Conclusions: Vapors from EC contain toxic and carcinogenic carbonyl compounds. Both solvent and battery output voltage significantly affect levels of carbonyl compounds in EC vapors. High-voltage EC may expose users to high levels of carbonyl compounds.

AB  - I process satellite-generated data on terrain elevation and presence of water bodies to precisely estimate the amount of developable land in U.S. metropolitan areas. The data show that residential development is effectively curtailed by the presence of steep-sloped terrain. I also find that most areas in which housing supply is regarded as inelastic are severely land-constrained by their geography. Econometrically, supply elasticities can be well characterized as functions of both physical and regulatory constraints, which in turn are endogenous to prices and demographic growth.

So, too, do genomics approaches have the potential to transform the way in which ecological studies can be conducted by providing powerful tools in which genotype and phenotype data of diverse "wild" populations can be measured with a never-before-possible level of fine-scale resolution. In this article, we examine the potential for genomics-enabled approaches to aid in understanding the responses of populations to climate change and highlight examples in which these tools have been applied to understand physiological adaptation or migration.

AB  - This article documents the fact that ventures funded by two successful angel groups experience superior outcomes to rejected ventures: They have improved survival, exits, employment, patenting, Web traffic, and financing. We use strong discontinuities in angel- funding behavior over small changes in their collective interest levels to implement a regression discontinuity approach. We confirm the positive effects for venture operations, with qualitative support for a higher likelihood of successful exits. On the other hand, there is no difference in access to additional financing around the discontinuity. This might suggest that financing is not a central input of angel groups. © The Author 2011.

AB  - This article investigates the role of product upgrades and consumer switching costs in the tying of complementary products. Previous analyses have found that a monopolist of one product will not increase its profits and reduce social welfare by tying and leveraging its monopoly position into a complementary market if the initial monopolised product is essential, where essential means that all uses of the complementary good require the initial monopolised product. We show that this is not true in settings characterised by product upgrades and consumer switching costs. We also discuss various extensions including the role of the reversibility of tying. © 2011 Royal Economic Society.

AB  - Frank Easterbrook's seminal analysis of error-cost minimization in The Limits of Antitrust has special relevance to antitrust intervention in markets where innovation is a critical dimension of competition. Both product and business innovations involve novel practices. Historically, the economics profession has tended initially to rely upon monopoly explanations for such practices. Courts have reacted with similar hostility. But almost always there has followed a more nuanced economic understanding of the business practice that recognized its procompetitive virtues. Antitrust standards have adjusted occasionally to reflect that new economic learning. This sequence has produced a fundamental link between innovation and antitrust error that transcends the uncontroversial point that the probability of false positives and their social costs are both higher in the case of innovation and innovative business practices. We discuss some principles for applying Easterbrook's error-cost framework to innovation. We then discuss the historical relationship between antitrust error and innovation. We conclude by challenging the conventional wisdom that the errorcost approach implies that the rule of reason, rather than per se rules, should apply to most forms of business conduct. We instead identify simple filters to harness existing economic knowledge to design simple rules that minimize error costs. We make five such proposals. © The Author (2010).

AB  - Competition and economic regulation policies have traditionally been based on the conception of a "standard" consumer who is perfectly rational, has a high level of computational skills, and is invariant to the environment in which choices are made. An ever-expanding body of research concludes that, for a variety of reasons, consumers often behave in various "non-standard" ways. In light of this research, some economic regulators and competition authorities are replacing the concept of the standard consumer with the concept of the non-standard consumer. This is justified on the basis that it is more realistic and offers the potential for more effective policies anchored in the behavior of actual consumers. While there are persuasive arguments for adopting a concept of the non-standard consumer, effectively integrating non-standard consumers into relevant policies raises conceptual challenges and risks, some of which have been borne out in practice. In particular, attention needs to be given to: the specific nature of the non-standard consumer behavior; the relative proportion of consumers characterized by non-standard behavior; possible supplier responses to remedial measures; and critically, the potential unintended effects of such policies. If these parameters and challenges are acknowledged and effectively incorporated into analytical frameworks, the potential exists for better-targeted competition and regulatory policies.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Google's autocomplete function provides "predictors" to enable quick completion of intended search terms. The predictors reflect the search trends of a population; they capture societal beliefs and perceptions about a variety of subjects. This study explores the predictors provided by Google United States when searching for information about older men and women. Research Design and Methods: The Google search engine of the United States was used to record predictors in response to 720 search terms. Inductive content analysis method was used to categorize and interpret the results. Results: There was prevalence of age and gender stereotypes in the predictors offered by Google. Queries about older men were primarily associated with romance and sexuality whereas those for older women centered on changes in the body as well as sexual and reproductive health. Discussion and Implications: The appearance of such predictors in response to a potential search query may lead to the spread of harmful stereotypes about older adults.

AB  - Introduction: The tobacco industry uses various aspects of cigarette packaging design to market to specific groups. The current study examined the relative importance of five cigarette packaging attributes-pack structure (eg, "slims"), brand, branding, warning label size, and price-on perceptions of product taste, harm, and interest in trying, among young females in Canada. Methods: A discrete choice experiment was conducted with smoking and nonsmoking females, aged 16 to 24 (N = 448). Respondents were shown 10 choice sets, each containing four packs with different combinations of the attributes: pack structure (slim, lipstick, booklet, traditional); brand ("Vogue," "du Maurier"); branding (branded, plain); warning label size (50%, 75%); and price ($8.45, $10.45). For each choice set, respondents chose the brand that they: (1) would rather try, (2) would taste better, and (3) would be less harmful, or "none." For each outcome, the attributes' impact on consumer choice was analyzed using a multinomial logit model. Results: The multinomial logit analyses revealed that young females weighted pack structure to be most important to their intention to try (46%), judgment of product taste (52%), and judgment of product harm (48%). Price and branding were weighted important in trial intent decisions (23% and 18%, respectively) and product taste judgments (29% and 15%, respectively). Whereas warning label size and brand were weighted important when judging product harm (23% and 17%, respectively). Conclusion: The findings suggest that standardized cigarette packaging may decrease demand and reduce misleading perceptions about product harm among young females.

This paper examines the assumption that the 160-character limit would force brief and thus comparatively uninformative responses in psychological research compared to other data collection modes. In laboratory classes, 463 psychology undergraduate students were randomly assigned to complete a 2-item questionnaire by SMS, e-mail, online survey, or paper survey. 2 weeks later, participants completed a multiple-choice self-report risk taking questionnaire on paper. While SMS response lengths were statistically significantly shorter than those yielded in other modes, they did not contain less information.

AB  - Recent research has attempted to describe meaningful experiences with entertainment media that go beyond hedonic enjoyment. Most of this research focuses on noninteractive media, such as film and television. When applied to digital games, however, such research needs to account for not only the content of the medium, but also the unique dimensions of digital games that distinguish them from noninteractive media. Experiences with digital games are shaped by the game mechanics that define the users' interaction with game content, as well as by the opportunities for social interaction that many games offer. We argue that the complex interplay of these dimensions (narrative, mechanics, and context) facilitates or inhibits meaningful user experiences in ways that are unique to digital games. © 2014 International Communication Association.

AB  - This paper examines the economic logic underlying bundles and tie-in sales and uses the lessons learned from that examination to analyze seven specific instances of bundling that have been the subject of antitrust scrutiny or other policy initiatives. Of particular interest are products that are nonrivalrous in consumption, making all-you-can-eat pricing a viable candidate for efficiency. The main economic points are the following: À-la-carte pricing may populate economic models, but most products are bundles. They are bundles because bundles are generally more efficient. Tie-in sales are much less common and often not properly understood in textbook discussions. Market foreclosure, the principal efficiency concern with tying and bundling, is likely to be exceedingly rare. The seven instances of bundling (ties) examined in the paper are: cable television; patent pools; blanket licenses; iPods and iTunes; telephones; music albums and songs; operating systems and component programs. © The Author (2008).

AB  - Questions about how algorithms contribute to (in)security are under discussion across international political sociology. Building upon and adding to these debates, our collective discussion foregrounds questions about algorithmic violence. We argue that it is important to examine how algorithmic systems feed (into) specific forms of violence, and how they justify violent actions or redefine what forms of violence are deemed legitimate. Bringing together different disciplinary and conceptual vantage points, this collective discussion opens a conversation about algorithmic violence focusing both on its specific instances and on the challenges that arise in conceptualizing and studying it. Overall, the discussion converges on three areas of concern-the violence undergirding the creation and feeding of data infrastructures; the translation processes at play in the use of computer/machine vision across diverse security practices; and the institutional governing of algorithmic violence, especially its organization, limitation, and legitimation. Our two-fold aim is to show the potential of a cross-disciplinary conversation and to move toward an interactional research agenda. While our approaches diverge, they also enrich each other. Ultimately, we highlight the critical purchase of studying the role of algorithmic violence in the fabric of the international through a situated analysis of algorithmic systems as part of complex, and often messy, practices.

AB  - Existing formal models of political behavior have followed the lead of the natural sciences and generally focused on methods that use continuous-variable mathematics. In 2002, Stephen Wolfram produced an extended critique of that approach in the natural sciences, and suggested that a great deal of natural behavior can be accounted for using rules that produce discrete patterns. This paper reports some initial findings designed to apply this pattern-based method to political event data. We believe that discrete sequence rule (DSR) models can provide a new social science methodology that is capable of preserving the agential basis of social interaction, tracking multiple agents as they enact rules through behavior directed at one another, and capturing the evolution of such interaction over time. The core of this project is a new, publicly accessible Web-based tool designed for the visualization and analysis of event data patterns (http://www.nkss.org). Using event data on the Israel?Palestine conflict generated by the TABARI automated coding program of the Kansas Event Data System (KEDS) for the period 1979?2004, we perform an initial exploration of this methodology. Specifically, we identify patterned behavior for which specific rule use can be imputed, and then examine several agent-based rules, plus four ?meta-rules,? to parse Israeli?Palestinian interaction over time. Face validity of the analysis is apparent, and we also find the qualitative historical record can be augmented through observation of rule enactment in the event stream. Several descriptive empirical applications are demonstrated, including moving totals and increasingly complex sequences of rule enactment that go beyond the simple variations on tit-for-tat responses. While this paper represents an exploratory analysis of the method, the results are promising enough to warrant further investigation beyond its use in thick description as demonstrated here, to ultimately include hypothesis generation and falsification.

AB  - The internet is a prominent source of health information for the public. This research evaluated both basic use and design tenets and the presence of theoretical components to motivate healthy breast cancer behavior for users of the most frequented breast cancer websites. Methodology: Each website was evaluated with 2 sets of questions. The first attends to the basic use and design tenets of the website. The second coding form assessed the websites use of 3 behavior change theories. Results: The majority of the websites fared well with regards to their use of basic tenet and design principles. Theoretical components were used sparingly on the majority of websites. Discussion: The most frequented breast cancer websites are currently well equipped with basic use and design tenets. However, their lack of behavioral change components is likely to impede users' motivations to protect themselves against breast cancer. © 2008 International Communication Association.

AB  - Rosenberg (1963, J. Econ. Hist., 23(4), 414-443) analyzed innovation in the 19th and early 20th century machine tool (MT) industry and its industrializing customers. This paper re-applies his analysis to the invention and application of information and communications technologies (ICTs) in the 20th and 21st centuries. Rosenberg's ideas of technological convergence and of collective learning that leads to a pool of knowledge in a competitive upstream industry are emphasized. In some ICT market segments, the primary customer is a technologist; for these segments, Rosenberg's analysis works quite well. The core reason appears to be that there, as Rosenberg said of MTs, the analysis can go forward on a "purely technological level." In the commercially oriented ICT market segments where most value has been created, this assumption fails. Difficulties at the boundary between purely technological innovation and commercial innovations change the analysis considerably. The locus of accumulating knowledge, the path of technological change through the economy, the structure of the industry supplying the general components and the degree of sharing of technical advances across firms and industries, all change in an easily explained way. The idea of the boundary between two complementary bodies of knowledge may be important. The idea that commercial innovation can be unlike technical invention may be important.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In 2018, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required that electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) manufacturers, packagers, importers, distributors, and retailers display an addictive or alternate warning statement on e-cigarette visual advertisements. Few studies have investigated the FDA-mandated and other warnings on social media. This study examined the prevalence and content of warning statements in e-cigarette-related YouTube videos. METHODS: In 2019, The Virginia Commonwealth University Center for the Study of Tobacco Products conducted bi-monthly (February-June) YouTube searches by relevance and view count to identify e-cigarette-related videos. Overall, 178 videos met the inclusion criteria. Staff coded each video for the presence of a visual/verbal warning statement, warning statement type (eg, FDA-mandated, addiction/tobacco, safety/toxic exposure, health effects), sponsorship, and tobacco product characteristics. A data extraction tool collected the video URL, title, upload date, and number of views, likes/dislikes, and comments. RESULTS: Only 5.1% of videos contained FDA-mandated and 21.9% contained non-mandated warnings. All videos with FDA-mandated and 46.2% of non-mandated warnings were represented visually. Only 13.1% of industry-sponsored videos uploaded after the mandate effective date had an FDA-mandated warning statement and videos with FDA-mandated and non-mandated (v. no) warnings had significantly fewer views, likes, dislikes, and comments. Among all non-mandated warnings, 31.3% featured an addiction/tobacco, 18.8% a safety/toxic exposure, and 37.5% a health effects warning. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of FDA-mandated warning statements in e-cigarette related YouTube videos was low. FDA enforcement of the warning statement mandate on YouTube could increase the public's understanding of the addictive nature of nicotine in e-cigarettes. IMPLICATIONS: The FDA has the authority to regulate the advertisement and promotion of e-cigarettes on the Internet. These data can inform future FDA requirements related to the language content and visual representation of addiction/tobacco, safety/exposure, and health effects warning statements that appear in YouTube videos and other visual social media popular among young people. Such data would help consumers make informed decisions about purchasing e-cigarette products, using e-cigarettes, and avoiding unintentional harm related to e-cigarettes. In addition, these data may help social media platforms make decisions on whether they will prohibit advertisements that promote or facilitate the sale of tobacco products.

AB  - Given the increasingly specific ways marketers can target ads, consumers and regulators are demanding ad transparency: disclosure of how consumers’ personal information was used to generate ads. We investigate how and why ad transparency impacts ad effectiveness. Drawing on literature about offline norms of information sharing, we posit that ad transparency backfires when it exposes marketing practices that violate norms about “information flows”—consumers’ beliefs about how their information should move between parties. Study 1 inductively shows that consumers deem information flows acceptable (or not) based on whether their personal information was: 1) obtained within versus outside of the website on which the ad appears, and 2) stated by the consumer versus inferred by the firm (the latter of each pair being less acceptable). Studies 2 and 3 show that revealing unacceptable information flows reduces ad effectiveness, which is driven by increasing consumers’ relative concern for their privacy over desire for the personalization that such targeting affords. Study 4 shows the moderating role of platform trust: when consumers trust a platform, revealing acceptable information flows increases ad effectiveness. Studies 5a and 5b, conducted in the field with a loyalty program website (i.e., a trusted platform), demonstrate this benefit of transparency.

AB  - We present an online experiment in which we investigate the impact of perceived social acceptability on online hate speech, and measure the causal effect of specific interventions. We compare two types of interventions: counter-speaking (informal verbal sanctions) and censoring (deleting hateful content). The interventions are based on the belief that individuals infer acceptability from the context, using previous actions as a source of normative information. The interventions are based on the two conceptualizations found in the literature: (i) what do others normally do, i.e. descriptive norms; and (ii) what happened to those who violated the norm, i.e. injunctive norms. Participants were significantly less likely to engage in hate speech when prior hate content had been moderately censored. Our results suggest that norm adherence in online conversations might, in fact, be motivated by descriptive norms rather than injunctive norms. With this work we present some of the first experimental evidence investigating the social determinants of hate speech in online communities. The results could advance the understanding of the micro-mechanisms that regulate hate speech. Also, such findings can guide future interventions in online communities that help prevent the spread of hate.

AB  - This article shows how new forms of electronic products and services become economically feasible and thus candidates for commercialization and creative destruction as improvements in standard electronic components such as microprocessors, memory, and displays occur. Unlike the predominant viewpoint in which commercialization is reached, as advances in science facilitate design changes that enable improvements in performance and cost, most new forms of electronic products and services are not invented in a scientific sense, and the cost and performance of them are primarily driven by improvements in standard components. They become candidates for commercialization, as the cost and performance of standard components reach the levels necessary for the final products and services to have the required levels of performance and cost. This suggests that when managers, policy makers, engineers, and entrepreneurs consider the choice and timing of commercializing new electronic products and services, they should understand the composition of new technologies, the impact of components on a technology's cost, performance and design, and the rates of improvement in the components.

AB  - Although the quantity of data on the location, status, and management of invasive species is ever increasing, invasive species data sets are often difficult to obtain and integrate. A cyberinfrastructure for such information could make these data available for Internet users. The data can be used to create regional watch lists, to send e-mail alerts when a new species enters a region, to construct models of species' current and future distributions, and to inform management. Although the exchange of environmental data over the Internet in the form of raster data is maturing, and the exchange of species occurrence data is developing quickly, there is room for improvement. In this article, we present a vision for a comprehensive invasive species cyberinfrastructure that is capable of accessing data effectively, creating models of invasive species spread, and distributing this information. © 2008 American Institute of Biological Sciences.

AB  - This research explores how cues deposited by social partners onto one's online networking profile affect observers' impressions of the profile owner. An experiment tested the relationships between both (a) what one's associates say about a person on a social network site via "wall postings," where friends leave public messages, and (b) the physical attractiveness of one's associates reflected in the photos that accompany their wall postings on the attractiveness and credibility observers attribute to the target profile owner. Results indicated that profile owners' friends' attractiveness affected their own in an assimilative pattern. Favorable or unfavorable statements about the targets interacted with target gender: Negatively valenced messages about certain moral behaviors increased male profile owners' perceived physical attractiveness, although they caused females to be viewed as less attractive. © 2008 International Communication Association.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to develop an evolutionary transaction cost economics approach capable of explaining the rise and fall of global network alliances once created to provide global services to multinational companies. In this global services market, market contracting and integrated corporations eventually replaced global network alliances. Both inefficiently designed or applied governance and efficiently realigned governance may explain why alliances failed and subsequently were replaced by more appropriate market contracting and integrated firms. The global alliance story also illustrates the point that economic actors initially may not have the requisite capacity to look ahead and recognize contractual hazards, but that such capacity and recognition may gradually evolve as a product of negative experience. © The Author 2008.

AB  - The vast majority of consumer behavior research has examined how consumers respond to products that are offered on a "take it or leave it" basis by the manufacturer. Self-design changes the rules substantially, allowing consumers to have much more control over the product's characteristics. This research examines the factors influencing consumers' evaluations of self-designed products. Three studies demonstrate that a superior fit between consumers' underlying preferences and their customized products cannot fully explain self-design evaluations. Comparisons with designers of comparable products can significantly influence evaluations as well. The first two experiments examine how social comparisons with the designers of similar "off-the-rack" products influence evaluations, identifying two key moderators useful in overcoming the negative effects of an upward comparison. A third study uses a real online design task to gain understanding of how the timing of the social comparison moderates the direction of the comparison (upward vs. equivalent) to influence evaluations. © 2009 by Journal of Consumer Research, Inc.

AB  - We explore the relationship between exclusivity and state-contingent control rights using a sample of over 100 Internet portal alliance contracts. We find that stronger exclusivity arrangements are associated with more frequent usage of contingent control rights. For both portals and their partners, the more exclusively bound one party is, the more likely its counterparty is to be granted contingent control rights. Additionally, we find that portals' alliance partners are more likely to receive contingent control rights when they are prohibited from doing business with other portals and that contingent control rights are less likely to appear as the industry matures. Our findings are consistent with theoretical explanations that exclusivity provisions and contingent control rights both provide incentives to invest in the face of potential holdup problems and also with the proposition that exclusive arrangements lead firms to seek contingent control rights to avoid lock-in when environmental uncertainty is high. © 2009 The Author.

AB  - Given persistent communication inequalities, it is important to develop interventions to improve Internet and health literacy among underserved populations. These goals drove the Click to Connect project, a community-based eHealth intervention that provided novice computer users of low socioeconomic position with broadband Internet access, training classes, a Web portal, and technical support. In this article, we describe the strategies used to recruit and retain this population, the budgetary implications of such strategies, and the challenges and successes we encountered. Results suggest that personal contact between study staff and participants and provision of in-depth technical support were central to successful recruitment and retention. Such investments are essential to realize the promise of eHealth with underserved populations. © 2013 International Communication Association.

AB  - Purpose: We report the results of a study designed to assess whether and how much potential individual end users are willing to pay for Quality of Life Technologies (QoLTs) designed to enhance functioning and independence. Design and Methods: We carried out a web survey of a nationally representative sample of U.S. baby boomers (aged 45-64; N = 416) and older adults (aged 65 and greater, N = 114). Respondents were first instructed to assume that they needed help with kitchen activities/personal care and that technology was available to help with things like meal preparation/dressing, and then they were asked the most they would be willing to pay each month out of pocket for these technologies. Results: We modeled willingness to pay some (72% of respondents) versus none (28%), and the most people were willing to pay. Those willing to pay something were on average willing to pay a maximum of $40.30 and $45.00 per month for kitchen and personal care technology assistance, respectively. Respondents concerned about privacy or who were currently using assistive technology were less willing to pay. Respondents with higher incomes, who were Hispanic, or who perceived a higher likelihood of needing help in the future were more willing to pay. Implications: Consumers' willingness to pay out of pocket for technologies to improve their well-being and independence is limited. In order to be widely adopted, QoLTs will have to be highly cost effective so that third party payers such as Medicare and private insurance companies are willing to pay for them. © 2013 The Author.

AB  - This paper examines the technologies that enable the representation of Hebrew on websites. Hebrew is written from right to left and in non-Latin characters, issues shared by a number of languages which seem to be converging on a shared solution-Unicode. Regarding the case of Hebrew, I show how competing solutions have given way to one dominant technology. I link processes in the Israeli context with broader questions about the 'multilingual Internet,' asking whether the commonly accepted solution for representing non-Latin texts on computer screens is an instance of cultural imperialism and convergence around a western artifact. It is argued that while minority languages are given an online voice by Unicode, the context is still one of western power. © 2013 International Communication Association.

AB  - Learning in the cellular phone environment enables utilizing the multiple functions of the cellular phone, such as mobility, availability, interactivity, verbal and voice communication, taking pictures or recording audio and video, measuring time and transferring information. These functions together with mathematics-designated cellular phone applications facilitate authentic learning based on real-life phenomena, and widen the range of mathematical activities possible to carry out. This research shows that the cellular phone provides the mathematics students with rich, diverse and colourful learning environment in and out of the classroom. The participating students worked with the cellular phone to carry out activities involving formal mathematical phenomena and at the same time authentic real-life phenomena which they modelled mathematically. Doing so, they worked individually and collaboratively with diverse, specific and general mathematical concepts and at the same time practiced specific and general mathematical procedures, which expanded their mathematical knowledge and meta-knowledge. The cellular phone enabled the students to work with various representations of mathematical objects which encouraged them to investigate these objects independently or with the guidance of their teacher. The students also could tackle advanced mathematical objects intuitively based on their visual representation and actual realization in real-life situations. © The Author 2011.

AB  - Nowadays consumers can easily connect with others who are pursuing similar goals via smart devices and mobile apps. This technology also enables them to compare how well they are doing relative to others in a variety of contexts, ranging from online gaming to losing weight to loyalty programs. This research investigates consumers' motivation to achieve a goal when they compare themselves with a superior other who has already attained the goal. Building on the literature on social comparison, and on competition in particular, we find that consumers are less motivated when the superior other has attained the goal compared to when the superior other is just ahead, keeping the relative distance equal. This negative effect on motivation is evident even in situations in which consumers can still attain the same goal as the superior other. We argue and demonstrate that this effect occurs because the other's goal attainment limits consumers' prospect to compete and overtake the superior other. Six experimental studies show evidence for this effect in hypothetical loyalty programs and behavioral task completion. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the motivational effect of social comparison, which have implications for marketing managers and public policy makers.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to better understand the online black market economy, specifically relating to stolen data, using crime script analysis. Content analysis of 13 English- and Russian-speaking stolen data forums found that the different products and services offered enabled the commodification of stolen data. The marketplace offers a range of complementary products, from the supply of hardware and software to steal data, the sale of the stolen data itself, to the provision of services to turn data into money, such as drops, cashiers and money laundering. The crime script analysis provides some insight into how the actors in these forums interact, and the actions they perform, from setting up software to finalizing transactions and exiting the marketplace.

AB  - Information technology and new media allow for collecting and sharing personal information at unprecedented levels. This study explores issues of privacy and surveillance with new interactive technologies. Based on a year-long field study, this project examines how people think about privacy and surveillance when using mobile social networks. Using the case of Dodgeball, the study found that most informants were not concerned about privacy when using the mobile social network because they felt they were in control of their personal information. There was, however, evidence of 3 kinds of surveillance present in everyday usage of Dodgeball: voluntary panopticon, lateral surveillance, and self-surveillance. This study sheds light on the everyday conceptions, meanings, and activities associated with surveillance, privacy, and interactive technologies. © 2011 International Communication Association.

AB  - Antitrust agencies in the United States and the European Union began investigating Google's search practices in 2010. Google's critics have consisted mainly of its competitors, particularly Microsoft, Yelp, TripAdvisor, and other search engines. They have alleged that Google is making it more difficult for them to compete by including specialized search results in general search pages and limiting access to search inputs, including "scale," Google content, and the Android platform. Those claims contradict real-world experiences in search. They demonstrate competitors' efforts to compete not by investing in efficiency, quality, or innovation, but by using antitrust law to punish the successful competitor. The Chicago School of law and economics teaches-and the Supreme Court has long affirmed-that antitrust law exists to protect consumers, not competitors. Penalizing Google's practices as anticompetitive would violate that principle, reduce dynamic competition in search, and harm the consumers that the antitrust laws are intended to protect. © The Author (2012).

AB  - Online fraud is the most prevalent acquisitive crime in Europe. This study applies routine activities theory to a subset of online fraud, online identity theft, by exploring country-level mechanisms, in addition to individual determinants via a multi-level analysis of Eurobarometer survey data. This paper adds to the theory of cybercrime and policy debates by: (1) showing that country physical guardianship (e.g. cyber security strategy) moderates the effects of individual physical guardianship; (2) introducing a typology of online capable guardianship: passive physical, active personal and avoidance personal guardianship; (3) showing that online identity theft is associated with personal and physical guardianship; and (4) identifying public Internet access and online auction selling as highly risky routine activities. The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of studying country-level effects on online identity theft victimization.

AB  - This study explores the effects of Internet self-efficacy and search task specificity on the self-efficacy outcome and task perseverance of finding online health-related sites that contain attributes of website accountability, as established by the American Medical Association (AMA). In a mixed 2 (self-efficacy) x 2 (search task specificity) repeated-measures experimental design, participants conducted two search tasks (general and specific) that varied in the amount of task difficulty. When search task specificity was taken into account, there was an Internet self-efficacy and task specificity interaction according to which high Internet self-efficacy participants locate sites higher in website accountability in the general search task (the more difficult search task) than their low self-efficacy counterparts. There was no significant difference in website accountability for the specific search task (the less difficult task). High Internet self-efficacy participants also demonstrated more task perseverance than their low Internet self-efficacy counterparts. © 2006 Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication.

In this paper, we focus on a mobile geotagging service called Socialight and the social practices associated with it. In-depth interviews and participant observation were conducted in order to explore how Socialight's virtual "sticky notes" were used in everyday life. Findings indicated how users communicate about place to help build social familiarity with urban places and communicate through place to allow users to create place-based narratives and engage in identity management. Such findings deepen our understanding of the social production of space and have implications for future location-based mobile services. © 2011 International Communication Association.

AB  - There is an ongoing debate in the survey research literature about whether and when probability and nonprobability sample surveys produce accurate estimates of a larger population. Statistical theory provides a justification for confidence in probability sampling as a function of the survey design, whereas inferences based on nonprobability sampling are entirely dependent on models for validity. This article reviews the current debate about probability and nonprobability sample surveys. We describe the conditions under which nonprobability sample surveys may provide accurate results in theory and discuss empirical evidence on which types of samples produce the highest accuracy in practice. From these theoretical and empirical considerations, we derive best-practice recommendations and outline paths for future research.

AB  - This study reports a content analysis of 35 World Wide Web sites that included in their mission the goal of engaging girls with information and communication technology (ICT). It finds that sites emphasize cultural and economic uses of ICT, doing little to foster civic applications that could empower girls as citizens of the information age. The study also finds that sites foster a narrow range of ICT proficiencies, focusing mostly on areas such as communication, in which girls have already achieved parity with boys. An examination of the role models portrayed in ICT occupations indicates that the sites show females mainly in elite technology jobs, reversing stereotypical mass media depictions of females in low-status roles in relation to ICT. Employing an original index of ICT knowledge and skills, the study finds that the sites that scored highest both on fostering comprehensive knowledge and skills as well as featuring civic content were general interest Web communities. Ownership (for-profit or not-for-profit) of sites was less important than editorial control: Sites that offered girls a place to contribute their own content were more likely to offer civic material and a broader range of ICT knowledge and skills. We conclude with recommendations for Web site designers to rethink their design strategies and their rationales for closing the gender gap in computing. © 2006 International Communication Association.

AB  - This article analyses the crucial role of user data for digital markets contestability and presents policy proposals devised to address growing concerns about the dominance of data-rich incumbents in digital markets. To this end, we discuss a data-driven theory of harm that would warrant ex-ante data access regulation and highlight that niche entry and growth should be the primary economic policy objective in digital markets characterized by strong data-driven network effects. We then evaluate regulatory data access remedies with respect to the involved economic trade-offs and their effectiveness for promoting niche entry and growth. Firstly, we analyse remedies that would limit the collection of user data by data-rich incumbents such as data silos and line of business restrictions. Secondly, we consider remedies that facilitate sharing of (user) data by opening up access to raw behavioural user data collected by data-rich incumbents. In particular, we propose a dual approach with two complementary types of data access remedies: bulk sharing of broad anonymized raw user data and continuous, real-time data portability of deep raw data that contain personally identifiable information. Finally, we comment on the recent proposal for a Digital Markets Act by the European Commission with respect to our findings.

We specify a general industry model involving consumers with differing search costs buying products from heterogeneous producers. We interpret e-commerce as a reduction in consumers' search costs. We show how it reallocates market shares from high-cost to low-cost producers. We test the model using US data for three industries: travel agencies, bookstores and new car dealers. Each industry exhibits the market share shifts predicted by the model but the mechanisms vary, ranging from aggregate factors in the travel industry to local-market factors in the other two industries. © The Author(s).

AB  - This article reports an ethnographic study of a subsidized computer center for children in an inner-city library. Unsurprisingly, young children play with the Internet. Surprisingly, this creates conflict with the justifications given for such centers by adults and public policy, leading to an atmosphere of tension between differing understandings of the Internet's purpose: as a place for ritual and play vs. as a place for the transmission of information and for work (Carey, 1989). Theories of play based on Huizinga (1950) and Gadamer (1989) are used to explain Internet play. The study finds that the narrowly instrumental rationales of public policy about the digital divide are rehearsed and repeated in everyday conversation at the center, even to the extent that child's play is denaturalized and seen as a problem that must be corrected. © 2006 International Communication Association.

AB  - Purpose:Older adults generally have an increased need for health care information. Whereas some use the Internet to look for this information, others use more traditional sources. This study gathered data from older adults to determine their health information needs, the perceived usefulness of sources of health information, and if there are differences in perceptions and use of health information between Internet users and nonusers.Design and Methods:We conducted 9 focus groups - 4 groups of Internet users (n = 27) and 5 groups of non-Internet users (n = 26) - to determine reasons for seeking health information, satisfaction with information, and use of the Internet to fulfill information needs. Data from focus groups were supplemented with questionnaire data.Results:Those who do not use the Internet were found to be just as satisfied with the health information they find as those who search for information online. We also found that nonusers are more likely to make health care decisions based upon information found offline than Internet users who have access to more information.Implications:Nonusers may find it quicker to look for information through traditional media sources and stay offline, thus limiting their information options. Strategies for encouraging Internet use and programs to teach effective searching skills are needed. Physicians could also direct older patients toward credible health information Web sites.

AB  - Search firms provide matchmaking services between consumers and suppliers that are central to the efficiency of the economy. The significant economic contributions of search firms as commercial intermediaries have important implications for antitrust policy towards search markets. As search firms generate more information about buyers and sellers, they become intermediaries for an increasing proportion of economic transactions. This article introduces the concept of the "map of commerce" to describe the extensive directory of business constructed by search firms. This article also introduces the concept of the "circular flow of information" to represent the comprehensive nature of the economic information managed by search firms. These firms induce information revelation through self-selection both by consumers and by advertisers. Consumers reveal personal information through the use of keywords and through their online behavior. Advertisers reveal company information by bidding on positions on the search page. Search firms employ information to match buyers with sellers more effectively and to increase earnings from advertising. The analysis shows that economic efficiencies generated by the circular flow of information depend on the strength of competition among search firms. The discussion considers antitrust policy towards Internet search markets, including issues of privacy, competition, and cooperative agreements. © The Author (2009).

We show that even simple, easily accessible variables from a digital footprint match the information content of credit bureau scores. A digital footprint complements rather than substitutes for credit bureau information and affects access to credit and reduces default rates. We discuss the implications for financial intermediaries' business models, access to credit for the unbanked, and the behavior of consumers, firms, and regulators in the digital sphere.

AB  - Although web surveys in which respondents are encouraged to use smartphones have started to emerge, it is still unclear whether they are a promising alternative to traditional web surveys in which most respondents use desktop computers. For sample members to participate in smartphone-based surveys, they need to have access to a smartphone and agree to use it to complete the survey; this raises concerns about coverage and nonresponse, as well as measurement if those who agree to participate have any difficulty using smartphones. In an analysis of data from a smartphone versus desktop (within-subjects) experiment conducted in a probability-based web panel, we compare estimates produced by the smartphone web survey (one condition) and PC web survey (other condition). We estimate mode effects and then examine the extent to which these effects are attributable to coverage, nonresponse, and measurement errors in the smartphone-based survey. While mode effects were generally small, we find that the smartphone web survey produced biased estimates relative to PC web for a subset of survey variables. This was largely due to noncoverage and, to a lesser extent, nonresponse. We find no evidence of measurement effects. Our findings point to the trade-off of the advanced data collection opportunities of smartphones and the potential selection errors that such devices may introduce.

AB  - Social workers are major mental health providers and, thus, can be key players in guiding consumers and their families to accurate information regarding schizophrenia. The present study, using the WebMedQual scale, is a comprehensive analysis across a one-year period at two different time points of the top for-profit and nonprofit sites that provide information regarding schizophrenia. Results demonstrate that the majority of sites offer comprehensive information and useful features. For-profit sites had higher ratings than nonprofit sites. Likewise, there was somewhat greater inconsistency for nonprofit sites across the two rating periods. The results demonstrate that systematic evaluation of online health information about schizophrenia can contribute to a "gold standard" for Internet health-related information. In addition, the results provide information that social workers can use with consumers and their families to guide them to quality online health information. A brief list of top sites is provided for social workers to give to consumers and families.

AB  - This study measured arousal responses to multitasking by recording switches between content on personal computers over a day. Results showed that switches occurred every 19seconds, more often than has been reported in previous research. Arousal was highest at the point of a switch with declines in skin conductance afterward. Switches were also preceded by a 12-second period of increasing skin conductance. 2 new methods were used, one an original application that recorded screen shots, and another that measured changes in skin conductance during the day using a wrist sensor. Results are discussed in light of increasing use of single devices displaying multiple types of content, rather than multitasking that occurs when attention is divided between content on multiple devices. © 2014 International Communication Association.

AB  - The widespread usage of smartphones, as well as their technical features, offers many opportunities for survey research. As a result, the importance and popularity of smartphone surveys is steadily increasing. To explore the feasibility of a new text-to-web approach for surveying people directly via their smartphones, we conducted a case study in Germany in which we recruited respondents from a mobile random digit dialing sample via text messages that included a link to a web survey. We show that, although this survey approach is feasible, it is hampered by a number of issues, namely a high loss of numbers at the invitation stage, and a high rate of implicit refusals on the landing page of the survey.

AB  - The communications field must challenge traditional understandings of media in the face of a transformation in the dynamics of capitalism that prioritizes the generation of value from data based on continuous surveillance. New advertising and data-processing developments mean that while the term media may continue to attach to the distribution of narratives, researchers must now conceive it as the convergence of message-circulation technologies with data-extraction-and-analysis technologies that are linked to everyday objects increasingly typical of our new mobile personalization era. In fact, nothing less than a radical revision of the boundaries of the communications field is required to adequately address the fundamentally altered social and economic order emerging from this ferment in the field of everyday life itself.

AB  - Surveys are a vital tool for understanding public opinion and knowledge, but they can also yield biased estimates of behavior. Here we explore a popular and important behavior that is frequently measured in public opinion surveys: news consumption. Previous studies have shown that television news consumption is consistently overreported in surveys relative to passively collected behavioral data. We validate these earlier findings, showing that they continue to hold despite large shifts in news consumption habits over time, while also adding some new nuance regarding question wording. We extend these findings to survey reports of online and social media news consumption, with respect to both levels and trends. Third, we demonstrate the usefulness of passively collected data for measuring a quantity such as "consuming news"for which different researchers might reasonably choose different definitions. Finally, recognizing that passively collected data suffers from its own limitations, we outline a framework for using a mix of passively collected behavioral and survey-generated attitudinal data to accurately estimate consumption of news and related effects on public opinion and knowledge, conditional on media consumption.

AB  - Social media have become a central source for news and current affairs information. This article focuses on the overarching attributes that shape how people come in contact with news, engage with news, and are affected by news on social media. Although all social media are different and change constantly, news experiences on these platforms can consistently be characterized as personalized, incidental, non-exclusive, as well as granularized and social (PINGS). Accordingly, this article introduces the PINGS framework, which acts as a systematization of social media news experiences and can be used to map key opportunities and challenges of using news across various social media platforms. In addition to presenting the framework components, the article also discusses how researchers can investigate PINGS in empirical studies.

AB  - Most discussions on the digital divide have predominantly focused on social disparities in the physical accessibility of information and communication technologies (ICT), and the proposed solutions are related to providing low cost access to the underprivileged. The mobile phone has been considered as a good solution due to its relatively low cost. This paper, based on an empirical study in Sri Lanka, demonstrates that even though the underprivileged population has adopted the mobile phone, most of the computer based communication facilities available in the phones are 'inaccessible' to such users due the objectification of broader social inequalities in the design of phones. In other words, the digital divide is objectified in the design. © 2014 International Communication Association.

AB  - Online research methodologies may serve as an important mechanism for population-focused data collection in social work research. Online surveys have become increasingly prevalent in research inquiries with young people and have been acknowledged for their potential in investigating understudied and marginalized populations and subpopulations, permitting increased access to communities that tend to be less visible- and thus often less studied-in offline contexts. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) young people are a socially stigmatized, yet digitally active, youth population whose participation in online surveys has been previously addressed in the literature. Many of the opportunities and challenges of online survey research identified with LGBTQ youths may be highly relevant to other populations of marginalized and hard-to-access young people, who are likely present in significant numbers in the online environment (for example, ethnoracialized youths and low-income youths). In this article, the utility of online survey methods with marginalized young people is discussed, and recommendations for social work research are provided.

AB  - The Internet has always been understood through spatial terminology—cyberspace, web addresses, sites, domains—but this article argues for moving beyond the metaphors to recognize the Internet as an embodied and socially-produced digital space. Building from a Lefebvrian framework of perceived, conceived, and lived spaces, the article proposes a new model for examining Internet social space, featuring three co-productive spaces: a space of affordance, a space of programming, and a space of virtuality. While our interaction with Internet social space is enabled through affordances, these actions are constrained by the limitations of the Internet's underlying programming. It is possible to subvert this power dynamic through tactical action when we realize that—unlike the spaces of affordance and programming—the space of virtuality is not tethered to any specific program or paradigm, but rather exists across platforms.

AB  - Technological convergence has led to the ability to access the internet from a variety of mobile devices. Drawing on the Mobile Phone Appropriation Model (Wirth, von Pape & Karnowski, 2008), we sought to understand how people conceptualize and use the mobile internet by conducting semistructured interviews with 21 mobile internet users, half American and half German in order to explore cross-cultural differences. Findings suggest little cross-cultural difference in use and understanding of the mobile Internet. Users do not perceive the act of "going online" as a significant step, even if it is on a mobile device. They do, however, distinguish between different ways of consuming information online (extractive and immersive), relating them to different situations and devices. © 2013 International Communication Association.

AB  - Disability is an important characteristic to consider in survey research. However, people with disabilities are a hard-to-reach population. Internet survey methods offer tremendous potential to expand researchers’ ability to reach and learn about people with disabilities. The goal of this study is to examine potential bias when using nonprobability Internet samples to investigate demographics and socioeconomic outcomes of people with disabilities. We compare the findings based on a national employment and disability survey instrument fielded to four samples: (1) a random-digit dial (RDD) sample, (2) a prescreened sample from a nonprobability Internet access panel, for which screening was based on the presence of 139 previously reported health conditions, (3) an unscreened sample from another nonprobability Internet access panel (without previously prescreened health conditions), and (4) a mixed nonprobability self-recruited (river and snowball) sample. Each sample was weighted on four demographic variables (gender, age, race/ethnicity, and region) using benchmarks from the American Community Survey (ACS). Three dichotomous outcome variables of interest (level of education, household income, and current employment status) were contrasted with weighted population estimates from the ACS. Results showed that the sample resulting from the RDD and all three nonprobability Internet samples differed significantly from ACS population estimates on all three outcome variables. Reweighting to include type of functional disability did not significantly reduce dissimilarities with ACS for any of the four samples. Nonprobability Internet survey methods offer relatively low-cost, easy-to-use avenues for disability-related research. Yet, researchers must proceed with caution to reduce or avoid known sources of bias in both the methodology and the interpretation of results.

AB  - Survey participants are increasingly responding to Web surveys on their smartphones as opposed to their personal computers (PCs), and this change brings with it some potential data-quality issues. This study reports on a randomized crossover experiment to compare the effect of two different devices, smartphones and PCs, on response quality in a Web survey conducted in a probability-based panel. Participants (n = 1,390) were invited to complete an online questionnaire on both a smartphone (mobile Web) and PC (PC Web) in sequence. We hypothesized that smartphone use would result in lower-quality responses because people are more likely to use smartphones while multitasking or while around other people and because they could have difficulty recording their answers using a small touchscreen. While we found that respondents who participated in this study were more likely to multitask and more likely to be around other people when using smartphones, these factors had little impact on data quality. Respondents were at least as likely to provide conscientious and thoughtful answers and to disclose sensitive information on smartphones as on PCs. When using smartphones, however, respondents seemed to have trouble accurately moving a small-sized slider handle and a date-picker wheel to the intended values. Overall, we find that people using smartphones can provide high-quality responses, even when their context is more distracting, as long as they are presented with question formats that are easy to use on small touchscreens.

AB  - This study examines factors influencing adoption and use of computer-based voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) phone service and attempts to integrate 2 theoretical approaches: the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the uses and gratifications framework. Using data from an online survey of VoIP users (N = 420), structural equation modeling analyses revealed that perceived ease of use had a significant impact on perceived usefulness. In addition, perceived usefulness had a positive effect on actual VoIP use. The study further discovered that motivations for communication and instrumental use significantly affected perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and actual VoIP use. This study suggests that integration of TAM and uses and gratifications can be fruitful in understanding user acceptance of new communication technologies. © 2010 International Communication Association.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Internet use is increasingly a necessity. However, older adults may not use the internet due to either nonhealth reasons (e.g., lack of digital literacy or internet access) or health-related reasons (e.g., visual impairment or movement difficulties). While researchers have studied internet use among older adults, most do not discriminate whether nonuse is due to health-related reasons or otherwise. We therefore examine the key correlates of health-related difficulty in internet use among older adults, and how it may affect the quality of life (QoL) through their perceived social support networks. Research Design and Methods: Data were from a national survey of older Singaporeans (N = 3,966) conducted in 2016-2017. Multinomial logistic regression and mediation analysis were used to identify older adult subgroups more likely to experience health-related difficulty in internet use, and whether such difficulty affected older adults' QoL through their social support networks. Results: Those of male gender, of Malay ethnicity, with less education, and with more instrumental activity of daily living limitations were more likely to experience health-related difficulty in internet use. Social support networks mediated the relationship between health-related difficulty in internet use and QoL. Discussion and Implications: Disparities in internet use are not just shaped by access or skill, but also health. Health-related difficulties in internet use are related to older adults' social support networks and quality of life. As social connections become increasingly based around networked individuals due to technological advancements, more attention should be given to addressing these health-related difficulties.

Factor and regression analyses conducted among 231 breast cancer patients revealed that social support perception and emotional well-being interacted with each other to influence online health information seeking. Patients with low social support perception and high emotional well-being were most likely to seek health information, whereas patients with high social support perception and high emotional well-being sought out the same information least. Practical implications of the study findings are further discussed. © 2013 International Communication Association.

AB  - Using Twitter as a case study, this article hypothesizes that social media content that is produced on mobile versus web platforms may be qualitatively different. As we increasingly tweet from our smartphones, we may be encouraged to "report" on our immediate thoughts, feelings, physical self, and surroundings. This article seeks to understand whether these presentations of self tend to be more egocentric, negative/positive, gendered, or communal depending on whether they were tweeted from mobile devices or web platforms. Using 6 weeks of Twitter data collected in 2013, we found evidence that users tweet differently from mobile devices and that mobile tweeting is informing new behaviors, attitudes, and linguistic styles online.

AB  - Despite the importance of conducting systematic literature reviews (SLRs) for identifying the research gaps in software engineering (SE) research, SLRs are a complex, multi-stage, and time-consuming process if performed manually. Conducting an SLR in line with the guidelines and practice in the SE domain requires considerable effort and expertise. The objective of this SLR is to identify and classify text-mining techniques and tools that can help facilitate SLR activities. This study also investigates the adoption of text-mining (TM) techniques to support SLR in the SE domain. We performed a mixed search strategy to identify relevant studies published from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2016. We shortlisted 32 papers into the final set of relevant studies published in the SE, medicine and social science disciplines. The majority of the text-mining techniques attempted to support the study selection stage. Only 12 out of the 14 studies in the SE domain applied text-mining techniques, focusing primarily on facilitating the search and study selection stages. By learning from the experience of applying TM techniques in clinical medicine and social science fields, we believe that SE researchers can adopt appropriate SLR automation strategies for use in the SE field.
