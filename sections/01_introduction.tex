Since mobile is the easiest acess point for many group, it will be important to translate the tool in the mobile age. This slr will analyze the research area on current trends, patterns and missing research, that will be needed. It should serve researcher that want to get an overview of the research field and practioner, that want to get aquianted with the basic needed to understand mobile surveys. 
Based on increasing mobile usage of the internet, this is and will be the most important device for assessing information on web. This means also online surveys a trending and increasingly important format has to adapt to this. What are the specialities
